CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The requirements for timeliness of the March 2022 VA Form 10182 have been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(f)(3).

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of March 23, 2020, but no earlier, for special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 1114, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.400, 4.1, 4.7.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2020 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

These issues return to the Board following a remand by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) that vacated a March 2024 Board decision issued under a different docket number. These matters have been properly re-docketed under an appropriate docket number associated with the March 2022 VA Form 10182 giving rise to this appeal. 

1. The appellant's March 2022 VA Form 10182 was a timely appeal of a December 2020 rating decision. 

VA received the Veteran's claim of service connection for lung cancer in May 2020. In December 2020 the AOJ granted the May 2020 claim of service connection for lung cancer and, in addition to rating that disability, awarded SMC- A&A effective April 6, 2020. The Veteran was notified of this decision by correspondence dated December 23, 2020. 

In February 2021 VA received notice that the Veteran had died on February [REDACTED] 2021. The appellant, Veteran's surviving spouse, requested to substitute in April 2021 and her request was granted later that same month.

In March 2022 the appellant filed a VA Form 10182 seeking an earlier effective date for the May 2020 grant of SMC - A&A. In March 2022 the appellant was advised that her March 2022 AMA NOD was not considered timely. In March 2024 the Board upheld the finding that the March 2022 AMA NOD was not timely. The appellant appealed this issue to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC). In October 2024 CAVC, pursuant to the terms of a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) by the appellant and VA, vacated the March 2024 Board decision and remanded the issue to the Board for consideration of whether the March 2022 AMA NOD was timely, with specific analysis of the effect of 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(f)(3) on the timeliness of the appellant's March 2022 appeal of the December 2020 rating decision. 

In December 2020 the AOJ issued a rating decision granting entitlement to SMC - A&A, effective April 6, 2020. The Veteran was notified of this decision by correspondence dated December 23, 2020. Generally, a VA Form 10182 must be received by VA within one year from the date that the AOJ mails the notice of decision. However, here, the evidence reflects that the Veteran died on February [REDACTED] 2021. 

As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths. Zevalkink v. Brown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Smith v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 330, 333-34 (1997); Landicho v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 42, 47 (1994). However, certain eligible persons may request to be substituted as the appellant for purposes of processing the claim to completion. Such request must be filed not later than one year after the date of the Veteran's death. See 38 U.S.C. § 5121A(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(b).

Here, VA received the appellant's request to substitute in April 2021; the request was granted later that same month. 04/15/2021, VA 21-534EZ Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation or Death Pension by a Surviving Spouse or Child; 04/27/2021, AMA Notification Letter. 

A substitute has the same rights regarding hearings, representation, appeals, and the submission of evidence as would have applied to the claimant had the claimant not died. The substitute must complete any action required by law or regulation within the time period remaining for the claimant to take such action on the date of his or her death. The time remaining to take such action will start to run on the date of the mailing of the decision granting the substitution request.

Here, the Veteran was notified of the decision granting SMC - A&A on December 23, 2020; he died on February [REDACTED] 2021. Thus, of the 365 days available to the Veteran to appeal the December 2020 rating decision, 55 had passed on the day of his death. Accordingly, 310 days remained for the appellant, once substituted, to appeal the December 2020 rating decision. The appellant's request to substitute was granted on April 27, 2021. March 3, 2022, was the 310th day following April 27, 2021. The appellant's VA Form 10182 was received on March 3, 2022. Therefore, the Board finds that the appellant's March 2022 VA Form 10182 was timely as to the December 2020 rating decision, consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(f)(3). 

Given the above, the Board concludes that the March 2022 VA Form 10182 was timely and the matter of entitlement to an effective date prior to April 6, 2020, for SMC - A&A is properly before it. 

2. Entitlement to an effective date of March 23, 2020, but no earlier, for special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance is granted. 

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 980 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

The Board acknowledges the appellant's contention that the issue of entitlement to SMC - A&A remains pending from an appeal of an August 2018 Legacy rating decision. The history and posture of that claim is addressed in two separate Board decisions under appropriate AMA and Legacy docket numbers. The December 2020 rating decision on appeal reflects that the AOJ considered the claim for SMC - A&A to have arisen from a May 19, 2020, claim and the matter of entitlement to SMC - A&A was adjudicated in that context. A claimant is entitled to nly one review on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. Accordingly, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the question presently on appeal before the Board is whether the criteria for entitlement to SMC - A&A were first met in the year prior to the receipt of the May 2020 claim. 

SMC - A&A is payable where a Veteran is "so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance." 38 U.S.C. § 1114(i); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b)(3). The need for aid and attendance means "helplessness or being so nearly helpless as to require the regular aid and attendance of another person." 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b). A Veteran will be considered to be in need of regular aid and attendance if he or she: (1) is blind or so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity of 5/200 or less, in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less; or (2) is a patient in a nursing home because of mental or physical incapacity; or (3) establishes a factual need for aid and attendance under the criteria set forth in § 3.352(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.351(b) - (c). Under § 3.352 the following will be accorded consideration in determining the need for regular aid and attendance (§ 3.351(c)(3): inability of claimant to dress or undress himself (herself), or to keep himself (herself) ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid (this will not include the adjustment of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); inability of claimant to feed himself (herself) through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to his or her daily environment. "Bedridden" will be a proper basis for the determination. For the purpose of this paragraph "bedridden" will be that condition which, through its essential character, actually requires that the claimant remain in bed. The fact that claimant has voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice. It is not required that all of the disabling conditions enumerated in this paragraph be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions which the veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his or her condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that the veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need. Determinations that the veteran is so helpless, as to be in need of regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that the claimant's condition is such as would require him or her to be in bed. They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352. 

The appellant has submitted statements regarding assistance that she has provided to the Veteran since 2015. 08/26/2019, Third Party Correspondence; 08/22/2019, NOD. In summary, the assistance provided by the appellant consisted of helping the Veteran dress himself; assisting with tube feeding; assisting with cannula maintenance; preparing and administering medicine via feeding tube; taking blood pressure readings; performing suction procedures on the Veteran's trachea; and performing administrative and logistical tasks such as inventorying medicines and feeding formulas and making appointments with healthcare providers. Id. 

If it is assumed that the above assistance is consistent with the substantive criteria for entitlement to SMC - A&A as provided for in § 3.352, then the evidence would establish that the Veteran has been in need of aid and attendance since well before one year prior to the receipt of the May 2020 claim for SMC - A&A. As discussed above, to show entitlement to an effective date up to one year prior to the date of claim for an increased rating, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the question is whether the criteria for entitlement to SMC - A&A were first met in the year prior to the receipt of the May 2020 claim.

However, the Board does not find that the evidence establishes that the Veteran was either in continuing need of regular aid and attendance as contemplated by 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350 - 3.352, or that he first became so between May 19, 2019, and March 22, 2020. VA treatment notes ranging from April 2019 through December 2019 reflect that VA treating providers characterized the Veteran as ambulatory and functionally independent in activities of daily living. 09/08/2020, CAPRI at 83, 114, 125, 132, 154, 221, 227. 

An April 2020 note from a VA treating provider reflects that provider's assessment that the Veteran required assistance with activities of daily living from his wife. 09/08/2020, CAPRI at 53. A VA treatment note dated March 23, 2020, palliative care consultation note reflects the report by the Veteran and his wife that the Veteran was "weak and needs extensive assistance from his wife." Id. at 46. 

In evaluating a claim for disability benefits, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

There is no evidence reflecting that the Veteran was either blind or so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity of 5/200 or less, in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less; or was a patient in a nursing home because of mental or physical incapacity, at any point during the period on appeal.

The Board finds that the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran first came to be "helplessness or being so nearly helpless as to require the regular aid and attendance of another person" on March 23, 2020.  

The Board concludes that the criteria for entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance are met no earlier than March 23, 2020. Accordingly, an effective date of March 23, 2020, for entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance is hereby granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 1114, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.400, 4.1, 4.7.
