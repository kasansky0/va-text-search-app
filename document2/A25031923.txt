ORDER

Service connection for glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis with degenerative arthritis of the left shoulder (left shoulder disability) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his left shoulder disability manifested in-service and has continued since.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a left shoulder disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1977 to October 2003.

In May 2003, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2022 decision. In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2022 decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. To establish a service connection for a disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

That determination requires a finding of current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service. Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309 (1993). Service connection may be granted for a disability diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability is due to disease or injury that was incurred or aggravated in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

There is also a presumption of service connection for the chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), including arthritis. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding that § 3.303(b) only applies to the chronic diseases listed in § 3.309(a)). Under this presumption, if the chronic disease manifested in service, then service connection will be established for subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any date after service, no matter how remote, without having to show a causal relationship or medical nexus, unless the later manifestations are clearly due to causes unrelated to service ("intercurrent causes"). 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338.

When the condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic at the time, or its chronicity may be legitimately questioned, then a continuity of symptoms after service must be shown to establish service connection under the presumption for chronic diseases. Id.; Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338-39. To establish service connection based on a continuity of symptoms under § 3.303(b), the evidence must show: (1) a condition "noted" during service; (2) post-service continuity of the same symptoms; and (3) a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptoms. Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 263-64 (2015).

A Veteran need only demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence to prevail. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). It is only when the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the claim that the claim must be denied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran contends that his left shoulder disability is related to service. Specifically, he has stated in the record that the disability had its initial onset in service and has continued unabated to the present.

The AOJ, in the August 2023 rating decision, noted in its favorable findings that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis with degenerative arthritis of the left shoulder. The Board is bound by this favorable finding and therefore finds the first element of a service connection claim has been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Regarding the second element of a service connection claim, the Veteran stated that he began to notice pain in his left shoulder in 2000, during service. The Veteran is competent to describe observable symptoms, such as pain. Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran's competent and credible statements regarding in-service left shoulder pain to be sufficient to fulfill the second element of a service connection claim.

Accordingly, the only question remaining is whether the Veteran's left shoulder disability is related to the Veteran's service. In this regard, there is evidence of continuous left shoulder symptomology since active-duty service. The Veteran has consistently reported that he has experienced progressively worsening left shoulder pain since service.

As stated above, the Veteran is competent to report on observable left shoulder pain and resultant symptomology during service, as well as his symptoms since his separation from service. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005) (holding that a Veteran is competent to report what occurred during service because he is competent to testify as to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307-08 (2007) (holding that lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Davidson, 581 F.3d 1313.

Additionally, the Board finds the reports of the Veteran's left shoulder symptomatology since service credible. See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. at 711, aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (table) (holding that, in determining whether statements submitted by or on behalf of a claimant are credible, the Board may consider their internal consistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant). These credible reports of a continuity of symptomatology suggest a link between his left shoulder disability and his military service. See Duenas v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 512 (2004).

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in June 2022. This examination noted the Veteran's left shoulder disability to have had its onset in 2000, during service. The Veteran reported that he has had pain in his left shoulder that had started years ago. 

The Board notes that the June 2022 VA examiner also rendered a negative etiological opinion. However, the Board finds this opinion to be inadequate as it relied on the absence of evidence in the Veteran's records and did not properly address the competent and credible statements regarding the onset of left shoulder symptomology in service. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007); Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (an examination was inadequate when the examiner did not comment on the Veteran's report of in-service injury and instead relied on the absence of evidence in the Veteran's service medical records to provide a negative opinion). Rather, the examiner simply concluded that it was less likely than not the Veteran's current left shoulder disability developed in-service as there were no documented visits for left shoulder problems. This conclusion is inadequate and therefore the opinion is given little probative value.

In sum, the evidence reflects that the Veteran experienced left shoulder pain and symptomatology in service and there have been continuous symptoms since service. There are no adequate medical opinions contrary to a conclusion that the Veteran's current left shoulder disability had its onset in service. Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
