REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2000 to September 2004.   

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in February 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims for service connection, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder and insomnia, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of the following: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Although lay persons are considered competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside of the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).

Under the benefit of the doubt rule, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral ankle condition (also claimed as joint pains and arthritis) is denied.

The Veteran claims his bilateral ankle condition is related to service. 

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) shows a complaint of right ankle pain in October 2003 after rolling an ATV.  See October 22, 2003 STR.  The record is absent for complaints of left ankle issues.

A June 2023 treatment record noted leg pain localized to ankle. See June 23, 2023 medical record.

The Veteran was notified of his January 3, 2024 VA ankle examination via mail on December 13, 2023 and December 16, 2023.  There is also evidence in the record that the Veteran was provided follow-up reminders via text and by telephone.  See December 29, 2023 C&P Exams.

The Veteran failed to attend his VA examination and a review of the claim's file shows that no good cause was shown prior to the rating decision on appeal. 

VA has statutory duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

When entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination or reexamination, an original claim for compensation is to be decided based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.65(b). When a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with any other original claim, a supplemental claim for a benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim for increase, the claim shall be denied. Id.  Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant, or death of an immediate family member. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a).

While the Veteran reported that he was sick and unable to attend in the June 2024, Notice of Disagreement, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2)?AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. ?See?38?C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

As the Veteran reported that he was sick after the date of the rating decision on appeal and there was no error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, the Veteran's claim cannot be remanded for this reason. 

The Board acknowledges there is evidence of pain in his ankle, however, the Board finds that the first element of service connection, the existence of a present disability, has not been met, nor has a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability have not been met.   

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for bilateral ankle disability must be denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for arthritis, right foot (also claimed as joint pain) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for foot pain, left (also claimed as foot injury, joint pain and arthritis) is denied.

The Veteran claims his bilateral foot pain is related to service. 

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show the Veteran had eight stitches in his foot.  See April 28, 2004 Report of Medical Assessment.  

A June 2023 post-service treatment record show a complaint of left foot pain, and left toe tendon surgery. See June 28, 2023 treatment record. 

The Veteran was notified of his January 3, 2024 VA foot conditions examination via mail on December 13, 2023 and December 16, 2023.  There is also evidence in the record that the Veteran was provided follow-up reminders via text and by telephone.  See December 29, 2023 C&P Exams.

The Veteran failed to attend his VA examination and a review of the claim's file shows that no good cause was shown prior to the rating decision on appeal. 

VA has statutory duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

As the Veteran reported that he was sick after the date of the rating decision on appeal and there was no error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, the Veteran's claim cannot be remanded for this reason. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran has evidence of current left foot pain; however, the Board finds that the first element of service connection, the existence of a present disability, has not been met, nor has a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability have not been met.   

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for bilateral foot disability must be denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for back pain (also claimed as low back condition, joint pains and arthritis) is denied.

The Veteran claims his back pain is related to service. 

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are absent for complaints, treatment or a diagnosis of a back disability.  

An October 2023 post service treatment record show a complaint of mid back pain which he reported was aggravated when he had to wear body armor for extended periods of time. See October 2, 2023 treatment record. 

The Veteran was notified of his January 3, 2024 VA musculoskeletal examination via mail on December 13, 2023 and December 16, 2023.  There is also evidence in the record that the Veteran was provided follow-up reminders via text and by telephone.  See December 29, 2023 C&P Exams.

The Veteran failed to attend his VA examination and a review of the claim's file shows that no good cause was shown prior to the rating decision on appeal.

As the Veteran reported that he was sick after the date of the rating decision on appeal and there was no error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, the Veteran's claim cannot be remanded. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran has evidence of current back pain; however, the Board finds that a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability have not been met.   

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for back pain must be denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for elevated lead level in blood is denied.

The Veteran claims his elevated lead level is related to service. 

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) is absent for complaints, treatment or a diagnosis related to elevated lead levels.

Post service treatment records do not show complaints, treatment or a diagnosis for elevated lead levels.

The Veteran was notified of his January 3, 2024 VA examination via mail on December 13, 2023 and December 16, 2023.  There is also evidence in the record that the Veteran was provided follow-up reminders via text and by telephone.  See December 29, 2023 C&P Exams.

As the Veteran reported that he was sick after the date of the rating decision on appeal and there was no error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, the Veteran's claim cannot be remanded for this reason. 

As there is no evidence of a current diagnosis related to elevated lead level, the Board finds that the first element of service connection, the existence of a present disability, has not been met. 

Moreover, findings of elevated lead levels are not a "disability" for the purposes of awarding VA disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1701 (1); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 444-45 (1995) (applying definition of disability in section 1701(1) to statutes describing "eligibility for disability compensation for service-connected disabilities"). Instead, it is a laboratory finding, not a disease or injury, or a disability resulting from a disease or injury. See 61 Fed. Reg. 20,440, 20,445 (May 7, 1996).

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for elevated lead level must be denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for gout (also claimed as arthritis and joint pains) is denied.

The Veteran contends his gout is related to service. 

A review of the Veteran's STRs are absent for complaints of gout.  

Post service treatment records show a diagnosis of gout.  See June 28, 2023 and July 12, 2023 treatment records. 

The Veteran was notified of his January 3, 2024 VA musculoskeletal examination via mail on December 13, 2023 and December 16, 2023.  There is also evidence in the record that the Veteran was provided follow-up reminders via text and by telephone.  See December 29, 2023 C&P Exams.

As the Veteran reported that he was sick after the date of the rating decision on appeal and there was no error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, the Veteran's claim cannot be remanded for this reason. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran has a current gout diagnosis; however, the Board finds that a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability have not been met. 

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for gout must be denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for headaches is denied.

The Veteran claims his headaches are related to service. 

A review of the Veteran's STRs are absent for complaints of headaches.  

Post service treatment records do not show complaints, treatment or a diagnosis for headaches.

The Veteran was notified of his January 3, 2024 VA headache examination via mail on December 13, 2023 and December 16, 2023.  There is also evidence in the record that the Veteran was provided follow-up reminders via text and by telephone.  See December 29, 2023 C&P Exams.

As the Veteran reported that he was sick after the date of the rating decision on appeal and there was no error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, the Veteran's claim cannot be remanded for this reason. 

As there is no evidence of a current diagnosis for headaches, the Board finds that the first element of service connection, the existence of a present disability, has not been met. The Board finds that the first element of service connection, the existence of a present disability, has not been met, nor has a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability have not been met.   

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for headaches must be denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus (also claimed as ringing in ears) is denied.

The Veteran claims his hearing loss and tinnitus are related to service. 

A review of the Veteran's STRs are absent for complaints of hearing loss or tinnitus.  

Post service medical records do not show a diagnosis of hearing loss or tinnitus.  

The Veteran was notified of his December 28, 2024 VA audiology examination via mail on December 13, 2023 and December 16, 2023.  There is also evidence in the record that the Veteran was provided follow-up reminders via text and by telephone.  See December 29, 2023 C&P Exams.

The Veteran failed to attend his VA examination and a review of the claim's file shows that no good cause was shown prior to the rating decision on appeal. 

VA has statutory duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

When entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination or reexamination, an original claim for compensation is to be decided based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.65(b). When a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with any other original claim, a supplemental claim for a benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim for increase, the claim shall be denied. Id.  Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant, or death of an immediate family member. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a).

While the Veteran reported that he was sick and unable to attend in the June 2024, Notice of Disagreement, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2)?AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. ?See?38?C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

As the Veteran reported that he was sick after the date of the rating decision on appeal and there was no error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, the Veteran's claim cannot be remanded for this reason. 

As there is no evidence of a current diagnosis for hearing loss, the Board finds that the first element of service connection, the existence of a present disability, has not been met. 

The Board recognizes that tinnitus is a disability which the Veteran can diagnose as it is within the Veteran's lay observations. However, the Veteran is not competent to relate the tinnitus to service as this requires medical expertise which he has not been shown to possess. Moreover, the Veteran has not identified when his tinnitus began. 

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus must be denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hip condition, is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral musculoskeletal - knee, (also claimed as joint pain and arthritis) is denied.

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for bilateral shoulder, bilateral knee, bilateral shin splints and bilateral hip condition must be denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for neck pain (also claimed as joint pain and arthritis) is denied.

The Veteran claims his neck pain is related to service. 

The Veteran's STRs are absent for complaints, treatment or a diagnosis for a neck condition. 

The Veteran's post service treatment records show complaints of neck pain, with the Veteran reporting that he had a bench press accident in 2001, where his neck popped after lifting heavy and that he experienced severe neck pain for a while.  See July 31, 2023 and August 14, 2023 treatment records.

As the Veteran reported that he was sick after the date of the rating decision on appeal and there was no error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, the Veteran's claim cannot be remanded for this reason. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran has current neck pain, however, the third element of service connection, a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability have not been met.  

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for neck pain must be denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for rhinitis is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2)?AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. ?See?38?C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Although the Board regrets further delay, having reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds that remand for a pre-decisional duty to assist error is required.

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder (claimed as anxiety condition, depression, social anxiety and PTSD) is remanded.

The Veteran is claiming service connection for anxiety condition, depression, social anxiety and PTSD and contends that his psychiatric disorders are related to service. The Board has broadened the issue accordingly and has recharacterized the claim as one of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

A review of the Veteran's STRs are absent for complaints, treatment or a diagnosis for a mental health condition.  The Board notes that the February 2024 rating decision conceded a PTSD stressor and noted a December 2023 diagnosis for depression. See February 5, 2024 rating decision. 

However, the Board notes that there are no VA medical records associated with the claims file after December 1, 2023.  After a review of the medical records, it does not appear that the December 23, 2023 medical record with a depression diagnosis is associated with the claim's file. 

The AOJ's failure to obtain updated medical records from December 2023 constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and the Veteran's claim must be remanded to obtain such records.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

Entitlement to service connection for insomnia (also claimed as sleep disturbances) is remanded.

The Veteran contends his insomnia is related to service. 

A review of the Veteran's STRs are absent for complaints, treatment or a diagnosis related to insomnia or sleeping issues.

A September 2023, telephone encounter note show a "sleep study in email on 9/5," which documented that the Veteran did not have obstructive sleep apnea, but did have nocturnal hypoxemia.  See September 11, 2023 treatment record.  Further, a September 2023 administrative note indicates that the Veteran received a Community Care sleep study, but comments in the record note the Veteran called and stated he does not want to continue with his sleep study and home oxygen arrangement and wished to drop everything at this time.  See September 22, 2023 scheduling administrative note. It does not appear that the sleep study report referenced in the September 2023 telephone encounter note is associated with the claim's file 

The AOJ's failure to obtain the Veteran's sleep study constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and the Veteran's claim must be remanded to obtain the records.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain outstanding VA treatment records related to the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder to include the December 23, 2023 treatment note documenting a diagnosis of depression and a sleep study referenced in the September 1, 2023 telephone encounter note.
