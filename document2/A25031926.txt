Entitlement to service connection for a neck injury to include as secondary to a service-connected right shoulder disability is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record does not show the Veteran's left ankle scars affects the head, face, or neck, and/or affects an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

2. The Veteran did not have three scars that were unstable or painful.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable evaluation prior to June 15, 2021, for left ankle scars associated with left ankle total arthroplasty, and an evaluation in excess of 10 percent since June 15, 2021, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.20, 4.118, Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 7802, 7804.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service with the Army from May 1977 to May 1980, November 1980 to November 1983, and October 1987 to August 1988.   

A January 2020 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for left ankle scars at a noncompensable rate effective January 6, 2020, under DC 7802.  In October 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), electing the Hearing review option.  This claim is separately docketed under docketed number 201008-122129.  A November 2020 BVA letter indicated this appeal was placed on the Hearing docket.

Subsequently, in February 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, requesting entitlement to an increased rating for total ankle arthroplasty.  In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking an increased evaluation for his left ankle scars.  An August 2022 rating decision denied entitlement to a compensable evaluation for left ankle scars under DC 7802.     

In August 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), appealing the August 2022 rating decision requesting entitlement to an increased rating for the left ankle scars.  

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking entitlement to service connection for a neck injury.  A March 2023 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for a neck injury.  In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 requesting HLR of the March 2023 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for a neck injury secondary to a right shoulder condition.  

A May 2023 rating decision identified duty to assist errors during HLR for the evaluation of the left ankle scars and service connection for a neck injury.  The HLR return indicated development of the record including VA examinations and medical opinions were necessary.  

A June 2023 rating decision granted entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation for left ankle scars effective June 15, 2021, now under DC 7804.  A decision on service connection for a neck injury was deferred.  An August 2023 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for a neck injury.  In August 2023, the Veteran asserted clear and unmistakable error (CUE) with the August 2023 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for a neck condition because it indicated the condition was not secondary to a left shoulder disability, but he had claimed it as secondary to a right shoulder disability.  Subsequently, another August 2023 rating decision was issued deferring a decision on the neck injury to request a medical opinion regarding secondary service connection.  In September 2023, following the development of the record, the Regional Office (RO) denied entitlement to service connection for a neck injury.   

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 requesting HLR of the June 2023 rating decision regarding an increased rating for the left ankle scars and the September 2023 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for a neck injury. 

A January 2024 rating decision denied entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left ankle scars under DC 7804 and denied entitlement to service connection for a neck injury.  In February 2024, the VA received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), electing Direct Review of the January 2024 rating decision.      

The Board notes that pursuant to the October 2020, January 2021, and September 2021 VA Forms 10182, there are pending appeals for entitlement to special monthly compensation and a total disability rating on the basis of individual unemployability (TDIU); increased ratings for the left knee, left ankle, right shoulder, left ankle scar, and hearing loss; and service connection for insomnia, penile conditions, and the right ankle, which will be addressed in separate decisions.

1. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation prior to June 15, 2021, for left ankle scars associated with left ankle total arthroplasty, and an evaluation in excess of 10 percent since June 15, 2021, is denied.

Applicable Law and Regulations

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentages contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  However, the evaluation of the same "disability" or the same "manifestations" under various diagnoses is prohibited. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

The Court has held that a veteran may not be compensated twice for the same symptomatology as "such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment of his earning capacity."  Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993).  This would result in pyramiding, contrary to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  The Court has acknowledged, however, that when a veteran has separate and distinct manifestations attributable to the same injury, he should be compensated under different DCs.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994); Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225 (1993).

Separate evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found.  In other words, the evaluations may be "staged."  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (staged ratings are appropriate when the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.); see also Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (2001).  A disability may require re-evaluation in accordance with changes in a veteran's condition.  It is thus essential, in determining the level of current impairment, that the disability be considered in the context of the entire recorded history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

The Board will generally review evidence from the date the VA received the Veteran's increased rating claim and during the one year "look back period" preceding the submission of the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  The appeal period before the Board is from March 15, 2022, the date VA received the VA Form 21-526EZ plus the one year look back period.  

From March 15, 2021, the Veteran was service connected for a left ankle scars at a noncompensable rate under DC 7802.  From June 15, 2021, the Veteran was service connected for left ankle scars at 10 percent disabling under DC 7804.  

In evaluating skin and scar residuals, the Board notes that during the appeal period, changes were made to certain DCs under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Effective August 13, 2018, VA amended its regulations governing skin disabilities.  VA's intent was that the claims pending prior to the effective date would be considered under both the old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria was more favorable to the Veteran would be applied.  For applications filed on or after the effective date, only the new criteria would be applied.  83 Fed. Reg. 32592 (July 13, 2018).

Under the old rating criteria, DC 7805 provided that other scars (including linear scars) and other effects of scars evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804 require the evaluation of any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under DCs 7800-7804 under an appropriate DC.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7805.  The Board notes that this DC is largely unchanged under the new amendments apart from the replacement of the phrase "(including linear scars)" with "and other effects of scars evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7804."  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7805 (August 13, 2018).

DC 7800 (which was unchanged by the 2018 amendments), contemplates scars of the head, face, or neck.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7800.  Under DC 7800, for disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for scarring with one characteristic of disfigurement.  A 30 percent disability rating is warranted with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips); or two or three of the characteristics of disfigurement.

A 50 percent disability rating is warranted with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips); or four or five characteristics of disfigurement.

An 80 percent disability rating is warranted with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips); or six or more characteristics of disfigurement.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

The eight characteristics of disfigurement for the purposes of rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 are: scar of 5 in. or more (13 or more centimeters (cm.)) in length; scar at least 1/4 in. (0.6 cm.) wide at its widest part; surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation; scar adherent to underlying tissue; skin hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding 6 sq. in. (39 sq. cm.); skin texture abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding 6 sq. in. (39 sq. cm.); underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding 6 sq. in. (39 sq. cm.); and skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding 6 sq. in. (39 sq. cm.).  Id., Note (1).

The pre-amended DC 7801 provided disability ratings for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are deep and nonlinear.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7801.  In contrast, the amended DC 7801 contemplates burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7801 (August 13, 2018).  Both the old and new criteria provide that a 10 percent rating is awarded when the area of the scar(s) covers at least 6 square inches (39 square centimeters) but less than 12 square inches (77 square centimeters).

A 20 percent rating is warranted when the area of the scar(s) covers at least 12 square inches (77 square centimeters) but less than 72 square inches (456 square centimeters).

A 30 percent rating is warranted when the area of the scar(s) covers at least 72 square inches (456 square centimeters) but less than 144 square inches (929 square centimeters).

A 40 percent rating is assigned when the area of the scar(s) covers at least 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7801.  Note (1) to the pre-amended DC 7801 stated that a deep scar is one associated with underlying soft tissue damage.

Prior to August 13, 2018, DC 7802 provided rating criteria for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are superficial and nonlinear.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802.  The amended version is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802 (August 13, 2018).  Both versions state that a 10 percent disability rating is warranted when the area of the scar covers 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater.

Under both the old and new rating criteria, DC 7804 provides disability ratings for scars that are unstable or painful.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for three or four scars that are unstable or painful.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for five or more scars that are unstable or painful.  Note (1) states that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  Note (2) provides that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, an additional 10 percent should be added to the evaluation based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.  Note (3) states that scars evaluated under DCs 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under this DC, when applicable.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a 0 percent rating for a DC, a 0 percent rating will be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (reasonable doubt to be resolved in the Veteran's favor); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is in approximate balance).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an increased rating for his service-connected left ankle scars.

In March 2021 correspondence, the Veteran reported a plan for upcoming left ankle replacement surgery.  In October 2021, his private providers found the left ankle was healing well with a 1.5 centimeter (cm) surgical incision without signs or symptoms of infection.  By February 2022, his private orthopedic providers assessed him to be status post left ankle total arthroplasty, and the surgical incisions were well healed.   

In a May 2022 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with left ankle scars following surgeries in 1988, 1994, 1998, 1999, and June 2021.  Scar #1 was located on the lateral left ankle and measured 0.5 cm, scar #2 was located proximal to scar #1 on the left ankle and measure 0.2 cm, and scar #3 was located on the left ankle and measured 0.5 cm.  The examiner observed the scars were superficial and linear, none were painful or unstable, and they were barely noticeable as they appeared normal skin color.  The scars without underlying tissue damage of the left lower extremity had an approximate total area of zero cm2.  The VA examiner opined the Veteran's scars did not impact his ability to work.  The May 2022 VA examination was probative evidence, as it relied on sufficient facts and data, and provided a rationale for the opinion.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).     

In August 2022, the Veteran reported to VA treating providers that he experienced pain in the left ankle since his surgery.  He reported numbness and tingling of the left leg and foot.  However, it appeared the Veteran's report pertained to the ankle itself and not the left ankle scars.  

In a June 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with two left dorsal foot surgical scars residuals of a left ankle replacement surgery.  The Veteran reported dull, sharp, and achy pain with tingling and numbness in left dorsal foot scars #1 and #2.  he reported the skin around the scars felt numb and tingled.  Underneath the scars had a sharp, achy pain daily.  However, the examiner noted the scars were not unstable.  Scar #1 was 4 cm x 2 cm and scar #2 was 1.5 cm x 2.5 cm.  The scars without underlying tissue damage of the left lower extremity had an approximate total area of 11.75 cm2.  The VA examiner opined the left ankle scars impacted his functional ability because per the Veteran's report wearing closed shoes irritated the surgical scars making them tender.  However, on the day of examination the examiner found the surgical scars were stable and non-tender to palpation.  The June 2023 VA examination was probative evidence, as it relied on sufficient facts and data, and provided a rationale for the opinion.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).     

From March 15, 2021, the Veteran was service connected for a left ankle scars at a noncompensable rate under DC 7802.  From June 15, 2021, the Veteran was service connected for left ankle scars at 10 percent disabling under DC 7804.  

After reviewing the competent lay and medical evidence, the Board finds that prior to June 15, 2021, a compensable evaluation is not warranted under DC 7802.  Even considering the longer of the size estimates of the Veteran's scars, the record did not show the scars to be greater in area than 144 square inches (929 square centimeters).  From June 15, 2021, an evaluation in excess of 10 percent under DC 7804 is not warranted.  The Veteran did not have three scars that were unstable or painful to warrant a 20 percent evaluation under DC 7804.

The examinations of record do not show evidence of the scars resulting in disfigurement of the head, face or neck; therefore, DC 7800 is not applicable.

DC 7801 provides that scars other than on the head, face, or neck that are deep, nonlinear, and cover an area of at least six square inches (39 sq. cm.) warrant a compensable evaluation.  Id., DC 7801.  A deep scar is one associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  Id.  As documented in the examinations discussed above, there is no evidence that the Veteran's left ankle scars status post left ankle replacement surgery covers an area of at least six square inches, or that it is deep.  Hence, DC 7801 is not applicable.

As to DC 7805, no scar was found to result in limitation of function.  While the Board notes that the June 2023 VA examiner indicated an impact on his functional ability, this was based on the Veteran's description of tenderness of the scars when wearing closed shoes.  There was no indication that this resulted in an abnormal gait or limited his mobility.  In fact, the examiner found no tenderness to palpation of the scars during examination.  There have been no other pertinent physical findings, complications, signs and/or symptoms associated with any scar (regardless of location) and the scar was found to have no impact on the Veteran's ability to work.

As such, the Board finds that a compensable evaluation for the left ankle scars under DC 7802 prior to June 15, 2021, is not warranted, and an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left ankle scars under DC 7804 since June 15, 2021, is not warranted.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for a neck injury to include as secondary to a service-connected right shoulder disability is remanded.

The Veteran contends his neck disability is due to his service.

The September 2023 rating decision made the following favorable findings: the evidence showed a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service (December 1987 service treatment note of pain radiating to the neck) and he had diagnosed disabilities of degenerative disc disease, degenerative arthritis, cervical strain, spinal stenosis, and status post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion C3/4 and C4/5.  Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings made by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Under the AMA, the Board has the jurisdiction to remand an appeal to the AOJ for correction of a pre-decisional regulatory or statutory duty to assist error if correction of such an error would have a reasonable possibility of helping to substantiate a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

The February 2023 VA examiner opined the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  Degenerative changes in the cervical spine were a natural part of the aging process and could be caused by a combination of factors including wear and tear, disc degeneration, osteoarthritis.  Each of the Veteran's claimed conditions developed and were diagnosed many decades after leaving service.  Neck pain since November 2021 per an emergency room visit, which was 41 years after leaving service.  October 2022 imaging showed degenerative disc disease/degenerative joint disease and cervical stenosis.  The Veteran underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion of C3/4 and C4/5 in January 2023.  The examiner was unable to establish a nexus with no evidence of recurrence, progression, chronicity, residuals, or sequelae after leaving service for over four decades.  Therefore, it was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the neck pain during service.  See https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27733227/.

Where the VA undertakes to provide the Veteran with an examination, it must be adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).  A review of the evidence of record showed during an October 1988 examination, J.M.'s (MD, PC) orthopedic surgery report noted the Veteran reported a crick in the right side of the neck all the time with frequent tingling in the right hand.  The February 2023 VA examiner failed to adequately address evidence of neck pain within two months of her separation from service.  Therefore, an addendum opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the claimed neck disability is necessary prior to final adjudication of the claim.  

Furthermore, in September 2023, the VA examiner opined the claimed condition was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected condition.  The examiner could not determine a baseline level of severity of the claimed condition based upon the medical evidence available prior to aggravation or the earliest medical evidence following aggravation by a service-connected condition.  Regardless, of an established baseline, the Veteran's claimed condition was not at least as likely as not aggravated beyond its natural progression by a service-connected condition.  Based on a review of the medical information provided, there was no pathoanatomical or pathophysiological correlation that would support causation or aggravation of a cervical spine condition due to a shoulder issue that was surgically repaired.  Based on this lack of correlation or causation and common clinical knowledge that a peripheral skeleton condition would not lead to or aggravate an axial skeleton issue, there was no nexus that could be reached in this case.  

Where the VA undertakes to provide the Veteran with an examination, it must be adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).  A review of the evidence of record showed March 2017 VA treating providers noting his complaints of right shoulder pain with associated neck cramping.  During the July 2019 VA examination for the right shoulder disability, the examiner noted weekly right shoulder flare ups resulting in shoulder pain and discomfort and neck spasms.  The September 2023 VA examiner's rationale failed to adequately address this evidence and explain why there was no causal relationship between the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder disability and his claimed neck condition.  Therefore, an addendum opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed neck condition is necessary prior to final adjudication of the claim.  

In requesting additional development, the Board notes that the basis for this remand arises from deficiencies in the record existing prior to the appealed?AMA?decision.  Based on the evidence associated with the claims file prior to the decision on appeal, a remand is necessary to ensure due process is followed and so that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claim. ??Pub. L. No. 115-55, § 2(d)(2); 38?U.S.C. §?5103A;?38?C.F.R. §?3.159.       

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from the September 2023 VA examiner regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's neck condition.  If the September 2023 examiner is not available, the opinion with rationale should be rendered by another qualified clinician.  If, and only if, the examiner feels that a physical examination is needed, one should be scheduled.

The examiner is asked to opine on the following: 

If it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's neck condition had its onset in service or was otherwise etiologically related to any event or circumstance of his service. 

The examiner is asked to consider and address: a December 1987 service treatment note of pain radiating to the neck and J.M.'s (MD, PC) orthopedic surgery report from October 1988, which noted a crick in the right side of the Veteran's neck all the time with frequent tingling in the right hand. 

If it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's neck condition was due to or aggravated by his service-connected right shoulder disability.  If aggravation is found, the examiner should state, to the extent possible, the baseline level of disability prior to aggravation.  This may be ascertained by the medical evidence of record as well as the Veteran's statements as to the nature, severity, and frequency of his observable symptoms over time.

The examiner is asked to consider and address: the March 2017 complaints of right shoulder pain with associated neck cramping and the July 2019 VA examination findings of weekly right shoulder flare ups resulting in shoulder pain and neck spasms.  

The complete record, to include a copy of this remand and the claims folder, must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner in conjunction with the examination.  The examination report must include a notation that this record review took place.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
