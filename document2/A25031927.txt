FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not manifest an acquired psychiatric disorder.

2. The Veteran does not manifest traumatic brain injury residuals.

3. The Veteran does not have a diagnosis for a memory loss disability, and his claimed memory loss has not manifested to a compensable degree during a six-month period since service and is not a manifestation of an undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1111, 1132, 5103(a), 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for service connection for traumatic brain injury have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1111, 1132, 5103(a), 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 3.304.

3. The criteria for service connection for memory loss, to include as due to undiagnosed illness or other qualifying chronic disability, are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1132, 5103(a), 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.317. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1990 to October 1993.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in January and February 2024 and constitutes initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal and the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal in the PTSD claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the claim's respective AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for back injury, left knee strain, right hip strain, and right hip strain, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, or nexus, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, which are listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), may be presumed to have been incurred during service if manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. Moreover, if a disease listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is shown to be chronic in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. Id. 

However, if evidence of a chronic condition is noted during service or during the presumptive period, but the chronic condition is not "shown to be chronic, or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned," i.e., "when the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported," then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required to support a claim for disability compensation for the chronic disease. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b)). A claimant "can benefit from continuity of symptomatology to establish service connection in the ultimate sense, but only if [the] chronic disease is one listed in § 3.309(a)." Walker, 708 F.3d at 1337.

A claimant bears the evidentiary burden to establish all elements of a service connection claim, including the nexus requirement. Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009). In making its ultimate determination, the Board must give a veteran the benefit of the doubt on any issue material to the claim when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence. Id. at 1287 (quoting 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b)).

1. Service connection for PTSD is denied.

The Veteran claims that he incurred PTSD during active duty while serving in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War. See February 2024 C&P Examination. 

There are particular requirements for establishing PTSD in 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f), that are separate from those establishing service connection generally. See Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010). In order to be entitled to service connection for PTSD, there must be medical evidence of PTSD, medical evidence that establishes a link between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f); Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.

Corroboration of the stressor is not required when a VA psychiatrist or psychologist diagnoses PTSD resulting from a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity when that fear is consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3). Corroboration of the existence of a stressor is also not required in certain circumstances when the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD in service, the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that experience, or the Veteran was a prisoner of war, and the claimed stressor is related to that experience. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(1), (2), (4).

In the June 2023 claim for compensation, the Veteran claimed PTSD related to feared hostile military or terrorist activity. See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

In the August 2023 Correspondence, the Veteran recounted extreme vivid nightmares beginning in 1992. The Veteran explained that he would "often wake up screaming and in a state of panic, I would find myself in a different room in my apartment, unaware of how I got there." See August 2023 Correspondence.

In February 2024, the Veteran reported to a VA examiner that during his service in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the Gulf War, "the ground war was over, and everything was leveled. He discussed the ongoing oil fires that would cover him and his unit in oil. He stated that there were unexploded munitions everywhere and he often feared that he could be killed/injured by unexploded ordinances." See February 2024 C&P Examination.

Service treatment records are silent for mentions of PTSD or any other acquired psychiatric disorder. In the September 1993 separation Report of Medical History, the Veteran denied experiencing "Frequent trouble sleeping," "Depression or excessive worry," "Loss of memory or amnesia," and "Nervous trouble of any sort." See February 2019 Service Treatment Records. In the September 1993 separation Report of Medical Examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran's psychiatric was normal. Id. In the January 1994 Medical Prescreening Form the Veteran completed upon entrance to the Army National Guard, the Veteran reported experiencing no "medical problems or defects of any kind." See June 2023 Service Treatment Record.

VA medical treatment records are also silent for mentions of PTSD or any other acquired psychiatric disorder. In a February 2019 Gulf War Registry Screening Examination, the Veteran reported aching joints, poor eyesight, hearing loss, and tinnitus, but he did not report PTSD, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, thoughts of service, poor sleep, avoidance of war issues, or anxiety. See February 2023 CAPRI Records. In a March 2019 PTSD screening, the medical provider gave the Veteran a score of zero which indicates a negative screen for PTSD in the past month. Id. The Veteran reported to VA medical providers that he was not involved in combat because the fighting was over by the time he reached Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Id. 

In the February 2024 VA medical examination, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's symptoms do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under DSM-5 criteria and that the Veteran does not have any other mental disorder that conforms with DSM-5 criteria. See February 2024 C&P Examination. The examiner came to this conclusion after examination of the Veteran via approved telehealth and review of the Veteran's casefile. Id.

While the Veteran is competent to report lay observable symptoms that he has experienced, he is not competent to diagnose a disability such as PTSD or any other acquired psychiatric disorder. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding that "PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence ... is competent and sufficient to identify).

The Board acknowledges that Veteran's report of current symptoms and avoiding treatment due to shame in the 2023 Correspondence has some probative value. However, a formal diagnosis is required for an acquired psychiatric disorder. Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F.4th 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2022).

Here, the record contains no competent diagnosis of PTSD or any other psychiatric disorder. As the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis, the first element of Shedden is not met and service connection cannot be granted. Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67. As such, the issue of in-service event or injury or medical nexus need not be discussed further. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the probative evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is inapplicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Service connection for traumatic brain injury is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a traumatic brain injury that he asserts was incurred by being in close proximity to firing tanks with no personal protective equipment. See November 2023 C&P Examination. 

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for mentions of traumatic brain injuries and memory issues. In the September 1993 separation Report of Medical History, the Veteran denied experiencing any loss of memory. See February 2019 Service Treatment Records.

The Veteran's VA treatment records are silent for mentions of traumatic brain injury and memory loss. In a February 2019 Gulf War Registry Screening Examination, the Veteran reported aching joints, poor eyesight, hearing loss, and tinnitus, but the VA medical provider noted the Veteran's memory was intact. See July 2023 CAPRI Records.

The Veteran was afforded a VA medical examination in November 2023. After an in-person examination and a review of the Veteran's casefile, a VA physiatrist concluded that the Veteran has not ever had a traumatic brain injury or any residuals of a traumatic brain injury. Id. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's reports of memory issues starting at age 25, but also noted that the Veteran had never been evaluated by a physician for memory issues and did not suffer from any other symptoms related to traumatic brain injury residuals. Id.

Although the Veteran is competent to report lay observable symptomatology, the Veteran is not competent to diagnose a disability such as traumatic brain injury or attribute any symptoms to the residuals of a traumatic brain injury. Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The record contains no competent diagnosis of traumatic brain injury. As the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of traumatic brain injury or memory loss shown to result in any impairment of earning capacity, the first element of Shedden is not met and service connection cannot be granted. Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67. As such, the issue of in-service event or injury or medical nexus need not be discussed further. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the probative evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is inapplicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

3. Service connection for memory loss is denied.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for memory loss that he contends was caused by traumatic brain injury. See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

As explained above, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, or nexus, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

With regard to the element of a current disability, current means near the time a claim is filed or at any time during its pendency. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007). Disability refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1362 (2018) (holding that pain can constitute a current disability, even without an underlying diagnosis, if it causes sufficient functional impairment).

The Board recognizes that the Veteran's service records show that the Veteran served in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran is a Persian Gulf War veteran.

Service connection may be warranted for a Persian Gulf Veteran who exhibits objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability that became manifest during active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, or that became manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 31, 2026. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1).

For purposes of 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, there are three types of qualifying chronic disabilities: (1) an undiagnosed illness; (2) a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness; and (3) a diagnosed illness that the Secretary determines in regulations prescribed under 38 U.S.C. § 1117(d) warrants a presumption of service connection.

An undiagnosed illness is defined as a condition that by history, physical examination and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to a known clinical diagnosis. In the case of claims based on an undiagnosed illness under 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, unlike those for direct service connection, there is no requirement that there be competent evidence of a nexus between the claimed illness and service. Gutierrez v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 1, 8-9 (2004). Further, lay persons are competent to report objective signs of illness. Id.

To determine whether the undiagnosed illness is manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more the condition must be rated by analogy to a disease or injury in which the functions affected, anatomical location or symptomatology are similar. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(5); see also Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470 (2006).

Objective indications of chronic disability include both signs, in the medical sense of objective evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical indicators that are capable of independent verification. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(3). Signs or symptoms that may be manifestations of an undiagnosed illness or a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) fatigue; (2) signs or symptoms involving skin; (3) headache; (4) muscle pain; (5) joint pain; (6) neurologic signs or symptoms; (7) neuropsychological signs or symptoms; (8) signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower); (9) sleep disturbances; (10) gastrointestinal signs or symptoms; (11) cardiovascular signs or symptoms; (12) abnormal weight loss; and (13) menstrual disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b).

For the purposes of section 3.317, disabilities that have existed for six months or more and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of improvement and worsening over a six-month period will be considered chronic. The six-month period of chronicity will be measured from the earliest date on which the pertinent evidence establishes that the signs or symptoms of the disability first became manifest. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(4).

A medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness is one defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms and specifically includes chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural gastrointestinal diseases), as well as any other illness that the Secretary determines meets the criteria in 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(ii) for a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness. A medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness means a diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology that is characterized by overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory abnormalities. Chronic multi-symptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology will not be considered medically unexplained. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(ii). 

The Veteran claims that he has memory loss which he believes is related to his service. As discussed above, the Veteran's Service Treatment Records do not show treatment for memory loss. The Veteran's VA treatment records note that the Veteran's memory was intact in February 2019 and are otherwise silent for memory loss. See July 2023 CAPRI Records. 

During a November 2023 VA medical examination, the Veteran reported to a VA examiner that his memory issues began in 1995 and explained having difficulty recalling old memories such as being unable to remember stories other veterans tell him that he was involved in. See November 2023 C&P Examination. The VA medical examiner concluded that the Veteran's memory caused no functional impairment. See November 2023 Traumatic Brain Injury Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

After review of all lay and medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence does not show that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with a disorder manifested by memory loss. In addition, there is no evidence that the Veteran's reported memory loss causes any functional impairment of earning capacity. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1362 (2018); Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393 (2020). Therefore, in the absence of a current clinical diagnosis or disability causing impairment, service connection for memory loss must be denied on a direct basis.

As noted above, because the Veteran is a Persian Gulf veteran, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 apply. The Veteran's reported memory loss does not qualify as an undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness, and the evidence of record does not show that his reported memory loss has manifested to a compensable degree during a six-month period since service separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1)(i).

The Board finds that the most appropriate rating criteria for memory loss are provided under Diagnostic Code 9411 pertaining to psychiatric disabilities. Under this Diagnostic Code, a 10 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 9411.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report that he experiences memory loss. However, even based on his reports, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms are not analogous to occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms. As discussed above, the Veteran's treatment records do not show reports of memory loss or that memory loss causes decreased work efficiency or ability to perform occupational tasks. In addition, the Veteran's statement to the November 2023 VA medical examiner only indicated that he had memory loss since 1995, it did not indicate that he has ever received treatment for his memory loss. As such, the Veteran's reported memory loss has not manifested to at least a compensable degree.

As such, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted under the Persian Gulf War presumption. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence of record weighs persuasively against finding objective evidence of a disorder manifested by memory loss manifested to a compensable degree during a six-month period since service separation. For these reasons, service connection on a presumptive basis is not warranted and this claim must be denied. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the probative evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is inapplicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for lower back strain is remanded. 

2. Service connection for right hip strain is remanded.

3. Service connection for right wrist strain is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for strains in his lower back, right hip, and right wrist that he claims he was incurred during his time in service performing actions related to his specialty as an M1 Abrams Armor Crewman including lifting heavy equipment and moving from the turrets to the main deck of the M1 Abrams and from the deck to the ground. See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds it necessary to remedy a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Veteran was afforded VA medical examinations in September and December 2023. The VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with lower back, right hip, and right wrist strains, but opined that those disabilities were less likely than not related to service explaining that "There was no sufficient evidence of medical records to suggest that the claimed condition was a chronic problem since during service." See December 2023 C&P Examination.

VA clinic records in February 2019 include an examiner impression of "mild joint pains likely related to jumping off tanks in body armour." The VA opinions of record does not address the theory that the current disabilities were caused by the rigors of the Veteran's military service. A remand is required. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007).

4. Service connection for left knee strain is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for left knee strain that he claims was incurred during his time in service performing actions related to his specialty as an M1 Abrams Armor Crewman. See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds it necessary to remedy a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Veteran was afforded a VA medical examination in September 2023. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis associated with his left knee. See September 2023 C&P Examination. The examiner recorded that the Veteran denied any pain or discomfort to the knee on the day of the examination and only complained of stiffness intermittently that is aggravated by prolonged kneeling or squatting. Id. 

Stiffness that results in functional impairment can be considered a disability. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). As such, remand is necessary to examine the Veteran for stiffness that causes functional impairment and consider the lay statements from the Veteran. Additionally, the Veteran is a Persian Gulf veteran and the AOJ did not consider the provisions of 38 C.F.R. 3.317 for an undiagnosed illness.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain addendum opinions as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed lower back, right hip, right wrist, and left knee conditions. The necessity of an in-person or telehealth examination of the Veteran is left to the discretion of the examiner. The electronic file must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner. 

The examiner should interview the Veteran regarding the frequency, severity and duration of any left knee symptomatology, and offer an opinion as to whether there is a current diagnosed condition or whether there is any objective functional impairment.

The examiner is requested to provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's claimed disabilities (including a left knee disability if there is a current diagnosis and/or objective functional impairment) are causally related to the rigors of military service. 

Specifically, the examiner should interview the Veteran regarding his military duties, consider the February 2019 VA clinic assessment of "mild joint pains likely related to jumping off tanks in body armour," and explain why or why not the rigors of this Veteran's military service contributed to the currently diagnosed orthopedic disorders.

2. If not current disability or functional impairment of the left knee is shown, the AOJ should consider the applicability of 38 C.F.R. 3.317.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
