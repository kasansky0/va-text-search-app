REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1987 to October 1990, and from January 1991 to April 1991, including service in Southwest Asia.

Procedural History

On July 10, 2023, the Veteran filed an initial claim seeking service connection of, inter alia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a lower back condition, sleep apnea, and "welps that comes and goes."  See July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  In a January 2024 Rating Decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Veteran's claims were denied upon finding no current diagnosis of PTSD or "welps," and that the overall evidence of record failed to demonstrate the elements necessary to establish service connection.

In a January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, direct review by the Board without submission of additional evidence and without a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record the time of the January 2024 Rating Decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Evidentiary Window

As noted above, in January 2024, the Veteran appealed the rating decision via VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the direct review option.  In May 2024, the Veteran submitted buddy/lay statements in support of his appeal.  The Board is mindful of the recent case of Edwards v. McDonough, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2023), where the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims reminded the Board of its obligations "to read the documents that a claimant files in support of his [or her] appeal liberally and sympathetically" and "to consider the full context within which [veterans'] submissions are made."  Id. at 62 (citing Rivera v. Shinseki, 654 F.3d 1377, 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011)).  The backdrop for this reminder is 38 C.F.R. § 202(f), which requires the Board to contact the claimant to request clarification of the claimant's intent whenever the Board cannot identify which review option the claimant intends to select.

In the present case, however, the Board can identify the review option desired by this Veteran.  As the Veteran's buddy/lay statements do not contain new evidence, but rather provide lay argument in support of his claims, the Board will consider them and assign them appropriate probative weight.  Thus, the Board will proceed with the Veteran's Direct Review selection.

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection requires evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply.  Id. at 781-82.

Acquired Psychiatric Disability

The Veteran contends that he has PTSD as a result of active service.  See July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Board finds it appropriate to recharacterize the claim as an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD and unspecified anxiety disorder, to better reflect the scope of the Veteran's claim, his intent, and the record.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  For clarity of the record, the Board will address his claim for PTSD separately as the service connection requirements are distinct from other psychiatric disabilities.

The requirements for establishing service connection for PTSD, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f), differ from those for establishing service connection generally.  Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence establishing a diagnosis in accordance with the DSM-5, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor(s) occurred, and a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor(s).  38 C.F.R. § 3.304.

A diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), which mandates that, for VA purposes, all mental disorder diagnoses must conform to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM).  See also Martinez-Boden v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 383 (2020) (holding that a diagnosis under DSM-5 is required for compensation for psychiatric disabilities).  Credible supporting evidence of the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor differs depending on the type of alleged stressor, i.e. whether the claimed in-service stressor is related to engaging in combat with the enemy, fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, being a prisoner of war, or based on an in-service personal assault.

In a December 2023 VA Initial Post Traumatic Stress Disorders Examination, the examiner concluded the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD.  Indeed, the record contains no medical evidence in support of a diagnosis of PTSD.  In the absence of credible evidence of a current diagnosis, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  Accordingly, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.

While the Veteran may believe that he has suffers from PTSD, he has not articulated evidence to support his claim and he lacks the medical expertise to establish a diagnosis.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical knowledge of competing psychiatric disorders.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Without evidence, his claim cannot be granted.  Thus, as to the Veteran's claim for service connection of PTSD, the Board concludes that the record does not establish that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of the claimed condition and has not had such at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  However, as the evidence is not in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.  Rather, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim for entitlement to service connection of PTSD.  Because the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the claim for PTSD must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

Unspecified Anxiety Disorder

Although the December 2023 VA examiner found no diagnosis of PTSD, a current diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder was confirmed.  See December 2023 VA Examination.  Additionally, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) due to the hardships of service and to specific in-service events.

Given the VA examiner's alternate current diagnosis and positive nexus opinion, the Board finds service connection of unspecified anxiety disorder is warranted.  In reaching the above conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of the Veteran's claim for service connection of an acquired psychiatric disorder as resultant from events during his period of active service.  Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303; Lynch 21 F.4th at 776; see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Sleep Apnea

The Veteran contends that he returned home from active service with symptoms that lead him to discover he was suffering with sleep apnea.  See July 2023 VA 21-526EZ.  The medical evidence of record confirms that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  See December 2023 VA Compensation and Pension (C&P) Examination.  Thus, the first element of service connection has been established.  See Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a).

As to element two, in a March 1991 separation examination, the Veteran reported no trouble sleeping.  His service treatment records (STRs) do not contain complaints of or treatment relating to any form of sleep disorder.  The Veteran reports his symptoms began in 1992, after he came home from Desert Storm, and started experiencing fatigue and constant drowsiness.  In 1995, his wife told him that he stopped breathing in his sleep and snored very loudly.  The Board notes that the Veteran's STRs do not document evaluation or treatment for snoring, daytime sleepiness or symptoms related to obstructive sleep apnea during service and post-service medical records contain no continuity of symptomology, or chronicity of care suggestive of OSA.

While the Veteran's lay statements are competent to report observable symptoms, he is not competent to provide a medical nexus, etiology of his OSA, or to determine that any observed symptoms were manifestations of OSA.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of the interaction between multiple internal systems in the body and interpretation of diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4.  Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran as the record does not show that he has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination.  Id; see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Consequently, the Board accords more probative weight to the December 2023 VA medical examination as detailed below.

With respect to the third element of direct service connection, the Board finds the evidence of record insufficient to establish a medical nexus between the Veteran's current diagnosis of OSA and his military service.  In a December 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran was not diagnosed with OSA until roughly 2003, some 12 years after service.  The examiner reported that risk factors for sleep apnea include excess weight, neck circumference, narrowed airway, family history of OSA or snoring, small lower jaw and certain other facial configurations, male gender, large tonsils, alcohol consumption at bedtime, hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroid hormone).  The examiner further reported that there is no valid medical literature to support a connection between the Veteran's OSA and his in-service toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  Thus, there is no indication that toxic exposure can result in sleep apnea.  In sum, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the toxic exposure risk activity, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

The Board finds the December 2023 examination and opinion adequate as the examiner considered the Veteran's history, medical records, lay statements, and STRs when forming her conclusion.  See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2012) (citing Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 293 (2012) ("[e]xamination reports are adequate when, as a whole, they sufficiently inform the Board of a medical expert's judgment on a medical question and the essential rationale for that opinion" even when the rationale does not explicitly "lay out the examiner's journey from the facts to a conclusion").  Thus, the Board finds the December 2023 VA examiner's opinion probative, as it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

While the Veteran has a current diagnosis of OSA, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that his OSA onset in service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  Accordingly, service connection is not warranted based on both the absence of an in-service incurrence and the lack of a medical nexus between the Veteran's active service and his current obstructive sleep apnea.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, but as the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  Rather, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  Accordingly, service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

Lower Back Condition

The Veteran contends that his lumbar spine disability was caused by in-service injuries during field maneuvers and excessive strain while working as a turret mechanic.  See July 2023 VA 21-526EZ.  The medical evidence confirms that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of lumbar spine osteoarthritis.  See September 2023 VA Treatment Records.  Thus, the first element of service connection has been established.  See Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a).

As to element two, the Veteran's service treatment records are negative for complaints/symptoms, diagnosis of, or treatment for a spinal condition.  In a March 1991 separation examination, the Veteran reported no recurrent back pain.  Post-service VA treatment records reflect a July 2023 complaint of lower back pain (principally left side) which was followed with a September 2023 MRI confirming lumbar spine osteoarthritis.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that his current lumbar spine osteoarthritis was caused by in-service injuries during field maneuvers and excessive strain.  Although the Board does not doubt the Veteran's contentions regarding in-service conditions and military occupational duties, without more, the Board cannot concede an event or injury to satisfy element two of direct service connection.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  In sum, the evidence does not support that his lumbar spine osteoarthritis disability was incurred in service or is otherwise directly related to service.  As such, the Board finds that the record persuasively weighs against an in-service incurrence or event relating to the Veteran's claim for direct service connection of a lumbar spine disability and on that basis the claim fails.

Assuming, arguendo, that the above evidence could satisfy element two of service connection, the record contains no evidence of a medical nexus between the Veteran's service and his current lumbar spine osteoarthritis, and the claim further fails on that basis.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination addressing his lumbar spine disability.  However, such an examination is not required.  In determining whether the duty to assist requires that a VA medical examination be provided, or medical opinion obtained with respect to a veteran's claim for benefits, there are four factors for consideration.  These four factors are: (1) whether there is competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) whether there is evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or evidence establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumption period; (3) whether there is an indication that the disability or symptoms may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability; and (4) whether there otherwise is sufficient competent medical evidence of record to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  Moreover, the Court has held that VA is not required to provide a medical examination when there is not credible evidence of an event, injury, or disease in service.  See Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36 (2010).

Here, the Veteran has a current lumbar spine disability, but the evidence of record is bereft of in-service complaints, treatment or diagnoses related to his lumbar spine and post-service medical evidence reflects initial complaints of lumbar pain some 30 years after active service.  While the Veteran is competent to report his current symptoms, as a lay person he does not have the education, training, experience to diagnose or opine as to the etiology of the condition.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Therefore, the Board finds that a VA examination and/or opinion is not necessary to decide this claim as there is no competent evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or evidence establishing his osteoarthritis manifested during an applicable presumption period, or any indication that the disability may be associated with his service or with another service-connected disability.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  However, as the evidence is not in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.  Rather, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim for entitlement to service connection of lumbar spine osteoarthritis.  As the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

Skin Disability

The Veteran contends that he suffers from "welps" and a fungus on his feet that occurred while in service as due to working conditions.  See July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  To better address the scope of the Veteran's claim, his intent, and the record, the Board finds it appropriate to recharacterize the claim as one for a skin disability.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

In a January 2024 VA Skin Diseases C&P Examination, the examiner was unable to confirm a diagnosis of welts or any rash-like disorder.  Although the Veteran's spouse presented three photographs of localized rashes on various body parts, the Veteran's face was not visible in the pictures and the examiner was unable to identify the source or person in the pictures.  The examiner, did however, confirm current diagnoses of tinea pedis and onychomycosis.  See January 2024 VA C&P Examination.  Thus, the first element of service connection has been established.  See Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a).

The Veteran reports that a rash appears randomly in various locations on his body and last for about three days.  He states that they began in 1992, he does not know what triggers them, and they occur approximately every few months.  He reports the areas are sensitive to touch, and he has not sought medical treatment for the condition.  He also reports no known skin allergies.  As to onychomycosis, he states that his symptoms began in 1990, and he attributes the cause of his tinea pedis to poor living conditions during service.  He notes that he tried antifungal cream without improvement, and he does not want to take oral antifungal medication due to potential liver damage.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) contain complaints of and treatment for plantar warts on his feet, which resolved, but of no other skin condition.  Post-service VA treatment records reflect complaints of onychomycosis with corresponding skin rash on his legs and knees and tinea pedis in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

While the Veteran's lay statements are competent to report observable symptoms, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis or medical nexus, of his skin disabilities or to determine that any observed symptoms were manifestations of his current skin disabilities.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of the interaction between multiple internal systems in the body and interpretation of diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4.  Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran as the record does not show that he has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination.  Id; see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Consequently, the Board accords more probative weight to the January 2024 VA medical examination as detailed below.

With respect to the third element of direct service connection, the Board finds the evidence of record insufficient to establish a medical nexus between the Veteran's current diagnoses of onychomycosis and tinea pedis and his military service.  In a January 2024 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran was not diagnosed with the conditions until roughly 2015, some 24 years after service.  In sum, in the absence of persistent/recurrent symptoms or current diagnosis for welts, no nexus to active service can be established, to include any caused by the toxic exposure risk activity.

While the Veteran has current diagnoses of skin disabilities, specifically onychomycosis and tinea pedis, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that those disabilities onset in service or are otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  Accordingly, service connection is not warranted based on the lack of an in-service incurrence and no medical nexus between the Veteran's active service and his current skin disabilities.

Attorney for the Board	Regnart, Glenda M.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
