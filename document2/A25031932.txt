ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type II is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran has had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type II during the period on appeal.

2. The evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran has had a formal diagnosis of OSA during the period on appeal.

3. The weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran's ED is due to his active service or is proximately due to or aggravated by any service-connected disability.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for diabetes mellitus type II have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

2. The criteria for service connection for OSA have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for ED have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1986 to May 1994.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2022 decision.  In June 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2022 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection 

Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Obesity, for purposes of service connection, is not considered a disease or disability for purposes of establishing entitlement to service connection under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 and 1131, or for purposes of establishing secondary service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  Obesity, however, may qualify as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability where a claimant establishes that the obesity was caused by a service-connected disability and caused his or her the current disability.  VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. Where obesity is asserted to be an intermediate step, the evidence must show that the service-connected disability "caused the Veteran to become obese," that the obesity caused by the service-connected disability "was a substantial factor in causing" the current disability, and that the current disability "would not have occurred but for" the obesity caused by the service-connected disability.  Id. 

The Veteran asserts that service connection is warranted for diabetes, OSA, and ED.  Specifically, he asserts that the claimed conditions are related to his service-connected disabilities (migraine headaches, depressive disorder, bilateral tinnitus, and bilateral hearing loss), with obesity as an intermediate step.  See VA Form 20-0996 received March 9, 2023.

Service Connection - Diabetes Mellitus Type II

Service Connection - OSA

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) does not show any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses for diabetes or a sleep condition. The February 1994 separation examination shows a normal clinical evaluation of the entire body, and does not show any complaints from the Veteran, or any notations from the medical officer, regarding diabetes or sleep issues.  

A review of the Veteran's post-service VA treatment records does not show any indications of formal diagnoses for diabetes or OSA. In September 2021, the Veteran's treating medical professional documented that a diabetes screening came back within the desired range; laboratory results at that time showed elevated glucose, but an "A1C" test result of 5.8, below the range for a formal diagnosis of diabetes. See also Understanding A1C, available at: https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/a1c (last visited April 7, 2025). Previous records to include as dated in October 2016 and November 2019, in the context of treatment for other conditions, noted that the Veteran's A1C was "at goal" or 5.2 or less. Similarly, there was no evidence that the Veteran underwent a sleep study or otherwise provided a formal diagnosis for OSA. A June 2016 VA outpatient record noted no history of sleep apnea.

The threshold requirement for the granting of service connection is evidence of a current disability. In the absence of evidence of a current disability, in this matter a diagnosis of OSA and ED, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). The requirement in a claim of service connection of current disability "is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim and that a claimant may be granted service connection even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim." See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007). Here, the Board finds that the competent and probative evidence of record does not show a formal diagnosis for OSA or diabetes at any time during or near to the pendency of the claims. Id. at 321; Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013). 

The Veteran and his attorney have not provided any clinical records showing formal diagnoses for these claimed conditions; the record does not reflect that the Veteran provided a signed VA Form 21-4142, authorizing VA to obtain private records in conjunction with his 2022 claim. 

In the March 2023 request for HLR, the Veteran's attorney indicated that the Veteran was "entitled" to a "VA examination evaluating whether his diabetes [and] sleep apnea" were related to his service-connected conditions with obesity as an intermediate step. However, VA must provide a medical examination or opinion when the following elements are established: 1) competent evidence of a current disability or recurrent or persistent symptom of a disability; 2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service; 3) an indication that the claimed condition may be associated with the Veteran's service or a current service-connected disability; and 4) insufficient medical evidence to decide the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). Here, as the evidence does not show diabetes or sleep apnea in service, or a current diagnosis of either condition, the "low threshold" for VA to assist the Veteran by providing a VA examination is not met. Id.

The Veteran is competent to report his experiences and symptoms. See, e.g., Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 471 (1994). However, no matter how sincere the Veteran's beliefs or assertions, they do not constitute competent medical evidence, such as a sleep study showing a diagnosis of sleep apnea or laboratory tests resulting an A1C or other findings of a diabetes diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Absent current diagnoses for these conditions, service connection for diabetes mellitus type II and OSA are denied. 

In reaching the conclusions stated above, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. As the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the doctrine is not for application. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Service Connection - ED

A review of the Veteran's STRs does not show any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses for erectile dysfunction or other genitourinary conditions. The February 1994 separation examination shows a normal clinical evaluation of the entire body, and does not show any complaints from the Veteran regarding erectile dysfunction or genitourinary issues.  

The Board recognizes that symptoms similar to ED are capable of lay observation.  See Layno, supra. However, review of the Veteran's post-service VA treatment records does not show any indication that he was being followed for, or diagnosed with ED. Extensive VA treatment records, including at those facilities identified by the Veteran on his VA Form 21-526, do not show complaints of ED, a diagnosis of ED, or treatment for ED. Further, as noted, the Veteran did not submit private records or a VA Form 21-4142 to authorize VA to obtain any private records regarding erectile dysfunction. 

Finally, while the Veteran may report symptoms, he does not have the competency (medical experience and training) to offer a diagnosis of ED, or otherwise determine its etiology. Jandreau, supra. To that end, because there is no competent diagnosis or evidence in service, the Board finds that the "low threshold" contemplated by McLendon is not reached and the AOJ's decision not to obtain an examination or opinion did not constitute duty to assist error. 

To that end, the Veteran's attorney contended that the Veteran's claimed ED is secondary to service-connected disabilities, to include obesity as an intermediate step. Notwithstanding the notation in an April 2021 VA treatment record noting obesity, this contention was made for the first time after the rating decision was issued that closed the evidentiary window in this case. Thus, while VA must address the contention, it is not obligated to remand to obtain an examination on the basis of pre-decisional duty to assist error. To that end, a careful review of the VA treatment records, specifically in April 2021, did not appear to contain any indication that any of the claimed conditions were related to service-connected conditions, with obesity as an intermediate step. Again, the Veteran has not submitted or identified any competent medical evidence that would suggest that service connection is warranted.

Accordingly, service connection for ED is denied. In reaching the conclusions stated above, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  As the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the doctrine is not for application.  See Lynch, supra; 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
