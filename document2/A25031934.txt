REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active military service from September 1983 to July 1987 and from December 1990 to April 1991.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of the May 2022 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 RO decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's claims any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for benign prostate hypertrophy is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his BPH and hemorrhoids are related to his active military service.

In July 2020, the Veteran submitted a correspondence indicating that he developed an infection in his prostrate during his active military service. He was given antibiotics, but it never cured. The Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records reflect that the Veteran was treated for an NSU in August 1986 and September 1986. The Veteran indicated he continued to have cloudy urine, and white puss discharge out of his penis. He indicated that he went through three prostate biopsies due to his enlarged prostrate. The Veteran's service treatment records reflect that he had symptoms for at least 45 days. The Veteran's separation examination did not note a BPH diagnosis, but the May 1987 report of medical history did not note that the Veteran had an NSU infection either. 

The Veteran stated that between 1986 and 1987 he was sent to the National Training Center for 30 days of dessert training. He ate MRE's three times daily. He became constipated and had to push, and strain to make a bowel movement, to which he attributes his current hemorrhoid condition. He stated that the constant pushing/straining also led to his hiatal hernia disability (which is currently service connected). The Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records reflect reports of "mess hall GI, diarrhea" [or possibly distress]. The issue of entitlement to service connection for BPH and hemorrhoids must be remanded to address a pre-decisional duty to assist error. The Board must remand claims to the RO to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors (including when the RO should have obtained a VA examination or nexus medical opinion). 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Board finds that that the threshold for providing a VA examination for the claim for entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's BPH and hemorrhoids was met, prior to the May 2022 rating decision on appeal, and that these issues must be remanded so that VA examinations may be provided. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician for the Veteran's BPH and hemorrhoid disabilities. Provide the examiner with the Veteran's complete record, to include a copy of all remands, and the claims folder.

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's BPH disability had its onset during or is otherwise etiologically related to the Veteran's active service (to include as related to the NSU infection noted in the STRs).

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's hemorrhoids disability had its onset during or is otherwise etiologically related to the Veteran's active service.

The examiner must discuss the Veteran's contentions in the July 2020 Correspondence, for the Veteran's BPH and hemorrhoid disabilities, and any statements elicited during the examinations. The examiner must also provide an opinion on the nature and etiology of these conditions.
