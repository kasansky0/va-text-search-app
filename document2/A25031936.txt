ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of October 31, 2018 for the grant of service connection for temporomandibular joint disease (TMJ) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On October 31, 2018, a complete and proper intent to file a claim for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits was received.

2. On March 30, 2019, within one year of the intent to file, the Veteran filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for TMJ.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of October 31, 2018 for the grant of service connection for temporomandibular joint disease (TMJ) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1998 to June 2001.

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2022 decision.  In June 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2022 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 decision.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of October 31, 2018 for the grant of service connection for temporomandibular joint disease (TMJ)

The effective date of an evaluation and grant of compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

A "claim" is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p). "Date of receipt" of a claim, information, or evidence means the date on which a claim, information, or evidence was received by VA. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (r).

Any documented communication from, or action by, a veteran indicating intent to apply for a benefit under laws administered by VA may be considered an informal claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.151, 3.155). However, the revisions are only effective for claims filed on or after March 24, 2015, and do not apply to claims pending as of that date. See Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686 (Sept. 25, 2014).

The Veteran first filed for service connection for TMJ in March 2002. Service connection was denied in a January 2003 rating decision. The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in February 2003. A Statement of the Case (SOC) was issued in September 2003. The Veteran did not file an appeal following the SOC, and the January 2003 rating decision therefore became final. 

No other formal or informal claim was received until March 30, 2019, the current effective date. However, the Veteran filed an Intent to File on October 31, 2018. At the time of his March 30, 2019 filing of his VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, the AOJ informed the Veteran that he was required to file his claim for service connection for TMJ on a supplemental claim form. The Veteran subsequently did so in June 2019. Due to this requirement, the Veteran's effective date was originally the date of the supplemental claim application, June 10, 2019. However, the AOJ has since changed the effective date to March 30, 2019, the date of the Fully Developed Claim. As the Veteran had previously filed the Intent to File on October 31, 2018, and this Intent to File was associated with the March 30, 2019 claim, the Board finds that October 31, 2018 is the proper effective date.
