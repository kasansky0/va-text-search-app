ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right dependent edema is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left dependent edema is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right dependent edema has not been shown to be manifested by intermittent edema of extremity or aching and fatigue in leg after prolonged standing or walking, with symptoms relieved by elevation of extremity or compression hosiery. 

2. The Veteran's left dependent edema has not been shown to be manifested by intermittent edema of extremity or aching and fatigue in leg after prolonged standing or walking, with symptoms relieved by elevation of extremity or compression hosiery. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable rating for right dependent edema are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7199-7121.

2. The criteria for a compensable rating for left dependent edema are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7199-7121.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from February 21, 1978, to September 30, 2002.

An August 2023 rating decision granted the claims of entitlement to service connection for right dependent edema and left dependent edema and assigned a 0 percent rating for both, with an effective date of April 18, 2023, for both as well. Later in August 2023, the Veteran requested a Higher-Level Review (HLR) of that decision as to the ratings assigned.

In January 2024, a HLR rating decision was issued that continued the 0 percent rating for both for right dependent edema and left dependent edema. Also in January 2024, the Veteran appealed that decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) by submitting a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and he selected the Direct Review Docket. 

Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence before the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the August 2023 rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301.

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right dependent edema is denied.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left dependent edema is denied.

The Veteran generally contends that his right dependent edema and left dependent edema both warrant a compensable rating. See VA Form 10182, received January 5, 2024. 

Currently, the Veteran is in receipt of a noncompensable rating for both his right dependent edema and left dependent edema under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DCs 7199-7121, with an effective date of April 18, 2023. See January 5, 2024, Codesheet. 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability ratings is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body, to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria required for that particular rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, that reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

As noted above, the Veteran's edema of the right and left side are currently evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7199-7121. See January 2024 HLR rating decision and Codesheet. However, the August 2023 rating decision that granted service connection for right and left side edema rated it under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, under DC 7114. Compensation for service-connected peripheral arterial disease is evaluated under DC 7114. 

The assignment of a particular diagnostic code is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case." Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993). One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the current diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Any change in a diagnostic code by a VA adjudicator must be specifically explained. See Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625, 629 (1992). Unlisted conditions may be rated by analogy to DCs that may not describe the unlisted disability but address disabilities that may be productive of similar symptoms. Scott v. Wilkie, 920 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (citing Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015)). When an unlisted disorder is being rated by analogy under 38 C.F.R. § 4.20, the listed disease or injury to which a veteran's condition is being rated by analogy must be only closely related, and not identical, to the unlisted condition. See Webb v. McDonough, 71 F.4th 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2023). Additionally, hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. Unlisted disabilities requiring rating by analogy will be coded first with the numbers of the most closely related body part and 99." 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

The Veteran was originally assigned a rating under DC 7114, but that DC relates to peripheral arterial disease and deals more foot and ankle issues, not edema of the lower legs. However, the January 2024 HLR rating decision changed that DC to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7199-7121 to better address the bilateral lower edemas based on their symptoms of edema involving the leg, such as swelling, as outlined in July 2023 VA medical examination. Here, the hyphenated diagnostic code indicates that the Veteran's left and right dependent edemas are rated under the criteria for post-phlebitic syndrome of any etiology, DC 7121. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79. 

When rating by analogy under 38 C.F.R. § 4.20, VA must adhere to the requirements of that regulation. Webb v. McDonough, 71 F.4th 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2023). Accordingly, the Board must address whether a listed disease or injury is 'closely related' to the veteran's ailment by considering three factors when determining which diagnostic code is most "closely analogous" to a given unlisted disability: "(1) whether the 'functions affected' by ailments are analogous; (2) whether the 'anatomical localization' of the ailments is analogous; and (3) whether the 'symptomatology' of the ailments is analogous." Id. at 1379, quoting Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 350 (1992). There are several DCs whose criteria mention edema and the Board focuses the analysis on these. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7113, 7118, 7120, 7121. 

The DCs mentioned above are applicable to disorders of the arteries and veins of the lower extremities. Nonetheless, the Board finds the function is most analogous to DC 7121. DC 7114, peripheral artery disease, addresses a disorder "due to narrowing and hardening of the arteries." 84 Fed. Reg. 37594, 37598 (Aug. 1, 2019). Edema is "the presence of abnormally large amounts of fluid in the intercellular tissue spaces of the body, usually referring to subcutaneous tissues." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 593 (32d ed. 2012). Edema is one form of venous insufficiency, the effects of which are the same regardless of the cause. 62 Fed. Reg. 65207, 65218 (Dec. 11, 1997). Indeed, edema appears in several diagnostic criteria, DCs 7113 (arteriovenous fistula, traumatic), 7118 (angioneurotic edema), 7120 (varicose veins) and 7121 (post-phlebitic syndrome of any etiology). It does not appear in the criteria for the DC originally assigned by the AOJ, DC 7114 (peripheral artery disease). 

The arteries and veins, though clearly part of the same vascular system, are distinct from one another. Thus, the application of DC 7114 for arterial disease is not localized to the same portion of the Veteran's anatomy. Thus, the Board concludes it is not the most analogous DC to use in rating the disability. Similarly, arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection of an artery to a vein and is therefore a problem of both. The Veteran's edema is the result of his coronary artery disease but is not the result of an arteriovenous fistula. The Board finds DC 7113 not localized to the same anatomy as the disability in question. Finally, angioneurotic edema is swelling of the lower layer of the skin and tissue just under the skin or mucous membranes. This is not a venous disorder. The Board finds DC 7118 not in the same anatomical locale.

Finally, the Board finds the symptomatology is analogous for DCs 7113, 7118, 7120, and 7121, as they all mention edema. 

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that DC 7121 for post-phlebitic syndrome of any etiology is the most analogous. The disorder in question is a venous disorder and DCs 7120 and 7121 are limited to the veins and refer to the specific symptom in question. Notably, DC 7120 for varicose veins rates disabilities using the criteria of DC 7121, making them the same for this analysis. As such, the Board finds it that the DC change to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7199-7121 is valid as it more appropriate to rate the Veteran under it based on his symptoms.

DC 7121 states that, for each affected extremity, a noncompensable rating is assigned for asymptomatic palpable or visible varicose veins. A 10 percent evaluation is assigned for varicose veins manifested by intermittent edema of extremity or aching and fatigue in leg after prolonged standing or walking, with symptoms relieved by elevation of extremity or compression hosiery. A 20 percent evaluation is warranted for persistent edema, incompletely relieved by elevation of extremity, with or without beginning stasis pigmentation or eczema. A 40 percent rating is warranted for persistent edema and stasis pigmentation or eczema, with or without intermittent ulceration. A 60 percent rating is warranted for persistent edema or subcutaneous induration, stasis pigmentation or eczema, and persistent ulceration. A 100 percent rating is warranted for massive board-like edema with constant pain at rest. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7121. 

The evidence of record shows in a May 23, 2022, Queens Medical Center record that the Veteran denied edema and VA records of May 13, 2023, and July 21, 2023, show that the Veteran's edema was present but stable.

Further, an August 2023 VA Artery and Vein Examination shows dependent edema of the right and left lower extremities. The Veteran described onset as leg swelling and the examiner found that the Veteran did not have chronic angioneurotic edema. As to functional impact, the examiner found that the dependent edema of the right and left lower extremities did not impact the Veteran's ability to perform any type of occupational task (such as standing, walking, lifting, sitting, etc.).

After review of the evidence as outlined above, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not reflect symptoms that would warrant disability ratings in excess of 0 percent for service-connected right dependent edema or left dependent edema. The currently assigned 0 percent disability ratings are consistent with the medical evidence of record, which fails to show that the Veteran's right and left dependent edema are manifested by intermittent edema of extremity or aching and fatigue in leg after prolonged standing or walking, with symptoms relieved by elevation of extremity or compression hosiery. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 1721.

The Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a compensable rating for both right dependent edema and left dependent edema. The Board affords the greatest probative weight to the August 2023 VA Artery and Vein Examination as it was based on an examination of the Veteran and reflects the symptoms of the dependent right and left edema in that examination and the examiner's professional medical opinion. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295 (2008). 

Accordingly, the Board finds that: (1) a rating in excess of 0 percent for right dependent edema is not warranted; and (2) a rating in excess of 0 percent for left dependent edema is not warranted. While a claimant is generally entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, there is no such doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor here. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
