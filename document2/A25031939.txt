FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's conceded Agent Orange exposure in service caused oropharyngeal cancer. 

2. The evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's conceded Agent Orange exposure in service caused the cervical node involvement of cancer. 

3. The evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's conceded Agent Orange exposure in service caused loss of taste.

4. For the period on review, the Veteran's COPD has more nearly approximated forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-1) of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or; FEV-1/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of 40 to 55 percent.

5. The Veteran is service connected for COPE which has reasonably shown to have been of a nature and severity that rendered the Veteran unable to maintain regular, substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and experience.

6. From March 21, 2024, the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling and additional disabilities independently rated as 60 percent disabling.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1967 to September 1970 with service in the Republic of Vietnam.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from multiple rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, which are a July 2024 rating decision (depressive disorder), a November 2024 rating decision (COPD), and a December 2024 rating decision (oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal, respectively, cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of increased rating for persistent depressive disorder, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Service connection for oropharyngeal cancer.

2. Service connection for cervical node involvement of cancer.

3. Service connection for loss of taste.

Legal Criteria

The Board notes that a September 2023 Board decision denied service connection for oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste. The Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim in August 2024 for service connection of these claims. In the December 2024 rating decision (on appeal), the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been received in support of the claims for service connection of oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste, respectively. The Board is bound by these favorable findings and will proceed with readjudication of the claims on the merits. See 38 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

In order to establish entitlement to service connection for a disability, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Service connection may also be granted on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury, or for additional disability resulting from the aggravation of a nonservice-connected disability by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc).

Service connection can also be established on a presumptive basis in cases where a veteran served continuously for 90 days or more during active service and certain chronic diseases become manifest to a degree of 10 percent within one year from the date on which the veteran separated from service, even if there is no evidence of the chronic disease during the period of service. This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Before a VA examination or opinion can be assigned probative weight, it must also be determined that it is adequate for the purposes of adjudication. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38?C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claim of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38?U.S.C. §?5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran's attorney argues he should receive service connection for oropharyngeal cancer to include cervical node involvement of cancer and loss of taste due to herbicide exposure. 

The December 2024 rating decision contained favorable findings of confirmed diagnoses of oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste, respectively. This rating decision also conceded service in Vietnam, exposure to herbicide agents during military service, and toxic exposure in Vietnam. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

Accordingly, the first two elements of service connection, a diagnosis and in-service event, have been met for each claim of service connection for oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste. What remains to be determined is whether there is a causal relationship (a nexus) between the diagnosis and in-service event for each claim, respectively. 

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations in September 2024 for each claim of oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste. In the corresponding medical opinion, the VA examiner opined the Veteran's oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste were all at least as likely as not caused by the indicated toxic exposure activities (Agent Orange exposure). See September 2024 Medical Opinion. The opinion was based on in-person examinations for each claimed disability, a review of the Veteran's record, and, specifically, the private oncologist opinion (discussed infra). The Board finds the September 2024 VA medical opinion adequate and assigns it high probative weight. 

The Veteran submitted a private opinion by an oncologist. See August 2024 C.R., MD opinion. The oncologist opined that the Veteran's oropharyngeal cancer was more likely than not a result of his exposure to Agent Orange, and the Agent Orange substantially or materially aided in the development of his oropharyngeal cancer. C.R., MD, provided a detailed and thorough review of the Veteran's cancer symptoms and treatment, and provided peer-reviewed medical literature regarding the connection between Agent Orange exposure and head and neck cancers. The Board finds C.R., MD's opinion adequate for rating purposes and assigns it high probative weight.  

The Veteran was afforded an additional VA examination in December 2024. The VA examiner, a general practice nurse practitioner, opined the Veteran's oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste are not due to herbicide exposure and that a nexus has not been established. This opinion was based on a records review and included details of this Veteran's cancer symptoms and treatment; however, it was not completed by a specialist. Additionally, the VA examiner discounted the oncologist's opinion describing it as suggesting VA can make the claimed disabilities presumptive for Agent Orange exposure. Accordingly, the Board finds it adequate for rating purposes and assigns it moderate probative value. 

The Board acknowledges there are competing nexus opinions regarding the causal relationship between the Veteran's conceded Agent Orange exposure in service and his claimed disabilities of oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste. The Board is required by statute to afford the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran when there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b). 

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran (as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.102), entitlement to service connection for oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste is warranted.

As these claims are granted service connection on a direct basis, it is considered a grant of the full benefit sought on appeal, and analysis of the secondary and presumptive bases are not required. 

4. COPD increased evaluation.

Legal Criteria

Disability ratings are determined by application of a ratings schedule which is based, as far as can practically be determined, on the average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Each service-connected disability is rated on the basis of specific criteria identified by Diagnostic Codes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. The degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for a loss of working time proportionate to the severity of the disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. However, pyramiding, that is the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when evaluating a Veteran's service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; see Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

The Veteran's COPD is currently evaluated at 30 percent under diagnostic code (DC) 6604. 

Under DC 6604, a 100 percent rating is assigned when FEV-1 less than 40 percent of predicted value, or; the ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in one second to Forced Vital Capacity (FEV-1/FVC) less than 40 percent, or; Diffusion Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide by the Single Breath Method (DLCO (SB)) less than 40-percent predicted, or; maximum exercise capacity less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption (with cardiac or respiratory limitation), or cor pulmonale (right heart failure), or right ventricular hypertrophy, or pulmonary hypertension (shown by echo or cardiac catheterization), or episode(s) of acute respiratory failure, or requires outpatient oxygen therapy.

A 60 percent rating is assigned when FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or; DLCO (SB) of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or maximum oxygen consumption of 15 to 20 ml/kg/min (with cardiorespiratory limit).

A 30 percent rating is assigned when FEV-1 of 56- to 70-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or; DLCO (SB) 56- to 65-percent predicted.

10 percent rating is assigned when FEV-1 of 71- to 80-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or; DLCO (SB) 66- to 80-percent predicted.  

Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) are required to evaluate these conditions. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(1). Post-bronchodilator studies are required when PFTs are done for disability evaluation purposes except when the results of pre-bronchodilator pulmonary function tests are normal or when the examiner determines that post-bronchodilator studies should not be done and states why. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(4).  When evaluating based on PFTs, post-bronchodilator results are used in applying the evaluation criteria in the rating schedule unless the post-bronchodilator results were poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results. In those cases, use the pre-bronchodilator values for rating purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(5).

When there is a disparity between the results of different PFTs so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflects the level of disability is utilized. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(6).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran's attorney asserts the Veteran should be awarded an increased evaluation for COPD.

The Veteran was awarded a 30 percent evaluation for the grant of service connection for COPD in a November 2024 Rating Decision. 

A VA Respiratory Conditions Examination was provided in September 2024. The examiner notated the Veteran's COPD requires use of inhaled medications including inhalational bronchodilator therapy daily, inhalational anti-inflammatory medication daily, and nebulizer albuterol. 

The Veteran's PFT returned the following test results: FEV-1 was 42 percent (both pre- and post-bronchodilator); FEV-1/FVC was 54 percent (post-bronchodilator) and 57 percent (pre-bronchodilator). The VA examiner indicated the FEV-1/FVC test result most accurately reflected the Veteran's level of disability.

Taking the post-bronchodilator results (as required by 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(4)), the Board finds that the Veteran's PFT results more nearly approximate the higher level disability criteria of FEV-1 of 40 to 55-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent. At no point during the period on appeal did the Veteran demonstrate or experience symptoms that would warrant a 100 percent (maximum) rating.  

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran (as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.102), the Veteran's COPD most closely approximated criteria of FEV-1 40 to 55 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent. Accordingly, a rating of 60 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's COPD is warranted.

5. Entitlement to a TDIU.

Legal Criteria

Entitlement to a TDIU may be granted where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or higher, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or higher, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or higher. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

Total disability will be considered to exist when there is impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation; provided that permanent total disability shall be taken to exist when the impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person. 38 C.F.R. § 4.15.

Substantially gainful employment is defined as work that is more than marginal and that permits the individual to earn a living wage. Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991). In Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) defined substantially gainful employment as "an occupation that provides an annual income that exceeds the poverty threshold for one person, irrespective of the number of hours or days that the Veteran actually works and without regard to the Veteran's earned annual income."

The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough; a high rating (in itself) is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment. Rather, the dispositive question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether the Veteran can find employment.

In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his age or impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19. In a claim for a TDIU, the ultimate question of whether a Veteran is capable of substantially gainful employment is not a medical one; that determination instead is for the adjudicator. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Factual Background and Analysis

On the March 2025 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran asserted he is entitled to a TDIU due to his service-connected COPD.

The Veteran is currently rated at 60 percent for his service-connected ischemic heart disease, 30 percent for persistent depressive disorder, 60 percent for COPD (as determined supra), 10 percent for hypertension, and noncompensable for hypothyroidism. The Veteran is now also service connected for oropharyngeal cancer, cervical node involvement of cancer, and loss of taste (as determined supra), and the initial ratings are to be determined by the AOJ in response to this Board decision. However, all service-connected disabilities are available for assessment in determining entitlement to a TDIU. Accordingly, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for a TDIU analysis and the Board may adjudicate in the first instance. 

The Veteran reported that he dropped out of school in the 11th grade, completed his General Educational Development (GED) in 1970, and does not have a college degree. See May 2024 VA examination. The Veteran reported being self-employed as a carpenter from June 1986 to June 2015 because he became too disabled to work in June 2015. See May 2016 VA Form 21-8940. However, at a May 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported retiring 2.5 years ago, or, approximately, December of 2021. An April 2020 VA treatment note documented the Veteran as still doing carpentry work. 

For the period on review, the Veteran reported constant shortness of breath, including when tying his shoes, and constant coughing which is productive. See September 2024 VA examination. The VA examiner determined the Veteran's service-connected COPD impacts his ability to perform occupational tasks. See id. He is not able to traverse steps because of his shortness of breath and wheezing; he has to use an inhaler when going to and from the mailbox (approximately 100 feet); he cannot stand for a period of time because of the shortness of breath; and he is not able to lift or carry five pounds. See id. Due to his COPD, the Veteran's legs are weak, he has no strength in his arms, and he has no energy. See August 2024 VA treatment note. 

The Board finds the Veteran is unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disability. The Veteran's primary work experience has been as a carpenter, and he has no college education or training. VA records show the Veteran is limited in standing, walking, traversing steps, lifting over five pounds, performing strenuous activity, or communicating with customers or coworkers due to his service-connected disability.

Resolving reasonable doubt in his favor (as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.102), the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected COPD was reasonably shown to have been of a nature and severity that rendered the Veteran unable to maintain regular, substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and experience. A TDIU is therefore warranted.

6. Entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate.

Because the Board has granted entitlement to a TDIU based on a single service-connected disability from August 21, 2024, entitlement to SMC at the "s" rate is implicated from this date. A veteran may be entitled to SMC if, in addition to having a single permanent disability rated 100 percent disabling under the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, the Veteran has an additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate, and distinct from the permanent disability rated as 100 percent disabling and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i). The total disability requirement must be met by a single disability, the 60 percent requirement may be met by applying the combined rating of the Veteran's remaining disabilities. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008) (noting that combined ratings satisfy the second requirement but not the first).

Due to the Board's grant of a TDIU based on service-connected COPD, a 100 percent evaluation has been established based on a single service-connected disability. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's ischemic heart disease/coronary artery disease is evaluated at 60 percent disabling. Thus, because from August 21, 2024, the TDIU award is based on a single service-connected disability and the Veteran has additional disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, entitlement to SMC at the "s" rate is warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Increased rating for persistent depressive disorder.

The Board's jurisdiction to remand is limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying regulatory statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim.

The Board finds there is a pre-decisional duty to assist error in that pertinent private treatment records are outstanding and have not been sought. An October 2023 VA treatment note documented the Veteran saw a mental health provider outside of VA. This treatment note is dated prior to the July 2024 rating decision on appeal. There is no evidence of record that VA sent a request for records to a private provider regarding the Veteran's persistent depressive disorder. As VA was aware of the private records and made no efforts to obtain them, there is a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and a remand is warranted. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask the Veteran to identify all private providers of evaluations or treatment he received for his persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and to submit authorizations for VA to secure for the record complete clinical records from all private providers identified.

2. Obtain any records identified by the Veteran and associate them with the claims file. If no response is provided by the Veteran or records are not received, provide a notation in the file, and notify the Veteran and his representative.
