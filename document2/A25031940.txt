DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

New and relevant evidence having been received, the claim for service connection for residuals of a chipped front right tooth is reopened.  

Service connection for residuals of a chipped front right tooth is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  Evidence received after the final May 2022 rating decision denying service connection for a chipped front right tooth tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the claim.  

2.  The Veteran does not have a dental disability for VA compensation purposes.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for readjudication of the claim for service connection for residuals of a chipped front right tooth have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5108, 7104(b), 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156 (d), 4.150, 3.2501(a)(1).  

2.  The criteria for service connection for residuals of a chipped front right tooth have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 4.150.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active-duty service from June 1998 to June 2003.

In June 2021, the Veteran filed his claim for service connection for residuals of a chipped right front tooth.  See VA Form 21-526EZ, received in June 2021.  In September 2021, the RO denied the claim.  In February 2022, the Veteran filed a request for higher-level review (VA Form 20-0996).  In March 2022, the RO found a duty-to-assist error.  In May 2022, the RO denied the claim.  In September 2022, the Veteran filed a request for higher-level review.  In January 2023, the RO determined that new and relevant evidence had not been received to reopen the claim for service connection for a chipped right front tooth.  In November 2023, the Veteran filed a request for higher-level review (VA Form 20-0996).  In April 2024, the RO determined that new and relevant evidence had not been received to reopen a claim.  

In April 2024, the Veteran filed a decision review request: Board appeal (notice of disagreement) (VA Form 10182), electing for Direct Review Lane, and citing the April 2024 RO decision.  Under the direct review option, no additional evidence received after the issuance of the appealed rating decision may be considered; rather, the Board review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the April 4, 2024 rating decision.  

1.  Residuals, chipped right front tooth. 

The Veteran asserts that service connection is warranted for residuals of a chipped right front tooth.  

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), if a Veteran is dissatisfied with an AOJ decision, they may elect one of three administrative review options by timely filing the appropriate form.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501, request a Higher-Level Review under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601, or appeal to the Board under 38 C.F.R. § 20.2020.

If the Veteran files a Supplemental Claim, new and relevant evidence must be presented for the AOJ to readjudicate the claim, taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156 (d), 3.2501.  Evidence is new and relevant if it (1) was not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators and, (2) tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a) (1).  The new and relevant standard does not impose a higher evidentiary threshold than the previous new and material evidence standard under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (a).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a).   

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  

Dental disabilities which may be awarded compensable disability ratings are set forth under 38 C.F.R. § 4.150.  These disabilities include chronic osteomyelitis or osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla or mandible, loss of the mandible, nonunion or malunion of the mandible, limited temporomandibular motion, loss of the ramus, loss of the condyloid or coronoid processes, loss of the hard palate, loss of teeth due to the loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible and where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis, when the bone loss is a result of trauma or disease but not the result of periodontal disease.  38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Codes 9900-9916.  

Rating activity should consider each defective or missing tooth and each disease of the teeth and periodontal tissues separately to determine whether the condition was incurred or aggravated in line of duty during active service and, when applicable, to determine whether the condition is due to combat or other in-service trauma, or whether the veteran was interned as a prisoner of war.  38 C.F.R. § 3.381 (b).

For loss of the teeth, bone loss through trauma or disease, such as osteomyelitis, must be shown for compensable purposes.  The loss of the alveolar process as a result of periodontal disease is not considered disabling.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Code 9913.  In addition, to be compensable, the lost masticatory surface for any tooth cannot be restorable by suitable prosthesis.  Id.

In order to establish service connection for VA compensation purposes, it is not enough to show that the teeth were lost due to trauma during active-duty service.  The evidence must demonstrate that the trauma resulted in loss of substance of the maxilla or mandible, which then resulted in the loss of the teeth.  VA's General Counsel has held that dental treatment of teeth, even extractions, during service does not constitute dental trauma.  See VAOPGCPREC 5-97, 62 Fed. Reg. 15,566 (1997); see also Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d. 802, 808 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  Treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar abscesses, and periodontal disease (pyorrhea) are not disabling conditions.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.381.

At the time of the RO's May 2022 rating decision, the record included the Veteran's service treatment records and VA treatment records and examination reports.  The Veteran's service treatment records showed that in 2003 he was treated for a fracture of tooth #25 (given the scope of this claim, treatment of other teeth will not be discussed).  

The only new medical evidence received since the RO's May 2022 decision is a January 2023 VA oral and dental conditions disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ).  This evidence shows that the Veteran was noted to have a traumatic fracture of tooth #25 during service, in about 2001.  The fracture occurred during physical training after a facial trauma.  The Veteran had some sensitivity after the fracture.  His dentist fabricated a crown.  He continues to have occasional random sensitivity with the tooth.  On X-ray, the tooth was WNL (within normal limits) with a crown in place.  There is no impact on the Veteran's ability to work.  There were no other relevant findings.  The examiner concluded that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran has a traumatic injury to tooth #25 during his service.   

Relevant evidence is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1).  The submitted evidence is new and relevant because the January 2023 VA DBQ includes an etiological opinion and relevant findings as to tooth #25.  Accordingly, the claim is reopened.  

The Board will proceed with readjudication of the claim on the merits.  In April 2024, the RO conceded that the Veteran injured his tooth #25 during service, but determined that service connection is not warranted because a compensable dental disability is not shown.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.150.  Accordingly, there is no prejudice to the Veteran with a decision on the merits.  Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394 (2010).  

The Board finds that the claim must be denied.  It may be conceded that the Veteran sustained a chipped front right tooth during service and that he currently has a crown in place at tooth #25.  However, no evidence has been received to show that the Veteran has a compensable dental disability, such as osteomyelitis or osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla or mandible; loss of the mandible, maxilla, ramus, or coronoid process; loss of the hard palate, not replaceable by prosthesis; nonunion of the mandible; limited motion of the temporomandibular articulation; or loss of teeth due to loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible, which was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 4.150.  The Veteran is not shown to have a compensable condition.  As the Veteran does not have a compensable dental disorder, there is no basis to award compensation based on the Veteran's claim.  

The Veteran has argued that his January 2023 VA examination was inadequate because the examiner did not note that he has a crown on tooth #25.  See Veteran's VA Form 20-0996, received in November 2023.  However, the January 2023 VA DBQ shows that the Veteran was noted to have a history of placement of a crown, and that on examination a crown was noted to be in place at tooth #25.  See Sections II and IV.A.  A dental X-ray showing an irregularity of tooth #25 is also of record.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran sustained trauma to tooth #25 during service.  However, the RO denied the claim because a compensable dental disorder is not shown.  Therefore, an omission of a material fact is not shown, and the January 2023 VA DBQ is found to be adequate for adjudicatory purposes.  As the evidence persuasively favors a finding that the criteria for service connection for residuals of a chipped front right tooth have not been met, the claim is denied.
