DOCKET NO. 210818-179851
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

The appeal under this docket is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The issue of entitlement to revision of a July 22, 1985 rating decision that denied service connection for a right knee disability, based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105, is currently pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals under a separate legacy docket associated with a prior appeal, and will be addressed by the Board in a subsequent decision under that docket.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal under this docket is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1980 to September 1984.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2021 decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in August 2021 and elected the hearing docket.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 7113(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.  

The Board finds that dismissal of this appeal is warranted because the issue adjudicated in the June 2021 AOJ decision, from which this appeal stems, was already pending on appeal before the Board under the legacy review system when the Veteran filed the present appeal under the modernized review system via the August 2021 Notice of Disagreement.  More specifically, in the context of an earlier legacy appeal, the Board assumed jurisdiction of the issue of entitlement to revision of a July 1985 rating decision based on CUE with respect to the denial of service connection for a right knee disability.  It remanded that issue to the AOJ several times, including most recently in August 2021.  The June 2021 AOJ decision stemmed from one of those remands, and the Board's August 2021 remand found that it failed to comply with its remand directives, necessitating another remand.  

Accordingly, as the appeal concerning the same issue is still pending before the Board under the earlier docket in the legacy review system, and will be addressed in a subsequent Board decision under that docket, dismissal of this appeal, including the Veteran's hearing request, is warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.
