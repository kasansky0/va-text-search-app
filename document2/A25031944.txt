ISSUE

Entitlement to a waiver of recoupment of military separation pay in the amount of $21,503.50.

ORDER

Entitlement to a waiver of recoupment of military separation pay in the amount of $21,503.50 is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran received military separation pay, in the post-Federal-tax amount of $21,503.50, when he separated from service in August 2021.

2. VA is required by law to withhold VA disability compensation benefits until the military separation pay which was paid at service separation are recouped.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a waiver of recoupment of military separation pay, in the amount of $21,503.50 have not been met. 10 U.S.C. §§ 1174, 1174a, 1203, 1206, 1212; 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.962, 1.963, 3.700(a)(5)(iii); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from October 2009 to August 2021. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 administrative decision, issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Following the February 2024 administrative decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD). The Veteran selected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted or received after the February 2024 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to a waiver of recoupment of military separation pay in the amount of $21,503.50.

The Veteran has appealed VA's decision to recoup his military separation pay, in the amount of $21,503.50.

By way of background, the Veteran was sent a Notification letter in January 2023, informing him that VA had learned the Veteran received military separation pay. The Veteran received $27,568.59, with a federal withholding of $6,065.09 for taxes. The Veteran was informed that, following his recent grants VA compensation, the post-tax amount of $21,503.50 would have to be recouped from that VA compensation. The Veteran was given a period of 60 days to respond before the recoupment was to begin.

Legally, the recoupment of a Veteran's severance pay from any VA disability compensation for the same disability is required by 10 U.S.C. § 1212 (d)(1). Similarly, 10 U.S.C. § 1174 (h)(2) states a service member who has received separation pay, severance, or readjustment pay under any other provision of law, based on service in the armed forces, shall not be deprived of any disability compensation to which he or she is entitled under the laws administered by VA. However, the Veteran shall have deducted from that disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of separation pay, severance pay, and readjustment pay received. Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.700 (a)(3). Where entitlement to disability compensation was established on or after September 15, 1981, a veteran may receive disability compensation for disability incurred or aggravated by service prior to the date of the receipt of the severance pay, but VA must recoup from that disability compensation an amount equal to the severance pay. 38 C.F.R. § 3.700 (a)(3).

Under 38C.F.R. § 3.700 (a)(5)(i), "[w]here entitlement to disability compensation was established on or after September 15, 1981, a Veteran who has received separation pay may receive disability compensation for disability incurred in or aggravated by service prior to the date of the receipt of separation pay subject to recoupment of the separation pay. Where payment of separation pay or special separation benefits under § 1174a was made after September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of separation pay or special separation benefits less the amount of Federal income tax withheld from such pay." 38 C.F.R. § 3.700 (a)(5)(i).

In March 2023, the Veteran responded that he was "never briefed and didn't know separation pay had to be paid back." He wrote that he was facing financial hardship and asked that his VA compensation benefits not be recouped to repay the military separation pay. This was interpreted a request for financial hardship by the RO.

In July 2023, the Veteran was contacted regarding his financial hardship request. The VA Representative informed the Veteran that he would need to submit a VA Form 5655, Financial Status Report (FSR). An FSR was then sent to the Veteran.

The Veteran did not immediately return the FSR, and so in November 2023, VA sent the Veteran a Notification letter informing him that VA is required to recoup the amount of separation pay. Thus, they were proposing to withhold the Veteran's VA compensation until the amount of $21,503.50 was recouped. The proposal was to begin February 2024.

The Veteran did not respond, and so in February 2024, VA informed the Veteran that the proposed action would take place. VA would begin withholding the Veteran's compensation until $21,503.50 had been recovered, to cover the post-tax severance pay that the Veteran received.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, NOD in April 2024. The Veteran wrote that he was appealing the decision of "recoupment of my entire compensation." He selected the Direct Review docket.

The Veteran's claim is now before the Board.

In consideration of the above, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim requesting a waiver of recoupment of the military separation pay must be denied. He has not disputed VA's ability to recover the separation pay through VA compensation, nor has he disputed the amount of $21,503.50 to be recovered. The Veteran had however argued that he was at diminished fault for the debt, as he was not informed of the prohibition on the receipt off military separation pay and VA compensation, and he argued that he was facing financial hardship. Both of these reasons fall within the standards of equity and good conscience for which a waiver of recovery of an overpayment is available under 38 C.F.R. § 1.965(a).

Having said that, the area of recovery of military separation pay is not an area whereby which a waiver of recovery can be granted. Although the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's circumstances, the Board must follow the applicable statutes and regulations, and it is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104; Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994). To that end, the amount subject to recoupment is not a debt or overpayment arising out of the operations of VA. Rather, is a statutorily mandated offset of separation pay benefits which were paid to the Veteran by the Department of Defense upon his release from active duty. See 10 U.S.C. § 1174(h)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.700(a)(5). Therefore, as the amount subject to recoupment has not resulted from a program administered under any law by VA, but rather is a mandatory prospective recoupment of military separation pay, the provisions regarding waiver of overpayment of VA benefits resulting from the existence of a debt based on equitable principles, including financial hardship, do not apply in this case.

The recoupment of an amount equivalent to the Veteran's separation pay, less the Federal income tax withheld from such payment, from his VA disability compensation is required by Congress under 10 U.S.C. § 1174(h)(2). See further 38 C.F.R. § 3.700(a)(5)(iii). Here, the law, as written by Congress and implemented by VA regulation, has been correctly applied. Thus, the claim for entitlement to a waiver of recoupment of military separation pay, in the amount of $21,503.50 must be denied as a matter of law. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
