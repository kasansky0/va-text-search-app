ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus had its onset during service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2011 to April 2015.

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for tinnitus most recently addressed in an August 2020 rating decision.  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. After the October 2023 rating decision, the Veteran timely filed a request for Higher Level Review for this issue, and April 2024 and September 2024 rating decisions further addressed this issue. While the Veteran is permitted to file more than one timely administrative review request, the only rating decision on appeal in the instant case is the October 2023 rating decision per the September 2024 notice of disagreement. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). The September 2024 rating decision is not on appeal at this time.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).?Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).? Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). 

The Veteran contends that his current tinnitus had its onset in service and has continued since. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that he was constantly around loud, hazardous noise while in service due to low flying aircraft, generators, tanks, helicopters, and weapons firing. 

In the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that an in-service exposure occurred as the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of infantryman has a high probability of exposure to hazardous noise; that the Veteran's military service treatment records (STRs) reflect exposure to acoustic trauma; that the Veteran is diagnosed with a disability as shown on VA examination in August 2020; and that such condition is a chronic disease that may be presumptively linked to service. The Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings under the AMA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Upon VA examination in March 2020, the Veteran reported constant tinnitus, and explained that it had its onset about two years prior.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus is not related to service because it did not have its onset during active service, but rather three years after active service. 

Upon VA examination in August 2020, the examiner referenced the March 2020 VA examiner's opinion and provided the same opinion and similar rationale. 

In his June 2023 claim, the Veteran explained that the tinnitus had its onset during active service, continued through his time in the Reserves, and has continued into his current daily life.

The Board finds both the March 2020 and August 2020 VA opinions to be of little probative value as they do not consider the statements the Veteran made in June 2023. In this regard, the AOJ did not obtain an updated VA examination to address the Veteran's June 2023 statement in support of his claim for tinnitus. Rather than remand for another opinion to correct such pre-decisional duty to assist error, the Board finds the Veteran competent to report that his tinnitus had its onset during active service and has continued since. 

The Board finds pertinent that tinnitus is a condition which may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature," and is capable of lay observation. Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 305 (2007). 

The Board finds the Veteran's reports of the onset of tinnitus during service to be competent and credible, and notably, VA has conceded that the Veteran's MOS is subject to a high probability of noise exposure. Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran's reports to be highly probative in this regard. 

Therefore, based on the probative evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
