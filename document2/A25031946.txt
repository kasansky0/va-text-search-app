ORDER

The appeal seeking an effective date prior to January 28, 2010, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and bipolar disorder is dismissed.

The motion to revise, based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE), the effective date of January 28, 2010, for the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder is dismissed without prejudice to refiling.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's request for an effective date prior to January 28, 2010, for the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder is a "freestanding" earlier effective date claim.

2. The November 2021 Supplemental Claim alleging CUE did not identify a VA decision nor set forth the alleged errors of fact or law in a specific decision, the legal or factual basis for such allegations, and why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The Veteran's freestanding claim seeking an effective date prior to January 28, 2010, for the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder lacks legal merit and is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.10; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

2. Because the pleading requirements for a motion for revision of a decision based on CUE have not been met, the motion must be dismissed without prejudice to refiling.  38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably on active duty with the United States Air Force from January 1987 to October 1990.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in this matter.

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the December 2021 decision.  In February 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior December 2021 decision.  

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in November 2024.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or her representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, the Board notes that in the December 2021 decision on appeal, the RO addressed the matter of an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder in the context of determining that an earlier effective date was not shown due to CUE.  However, a motion seeking revision of a decision based on CUE is completely separate from a claim seeking an earlier effective date for an award of disability compensation.  See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006).  Therefore, the Board has addressed the claim for an earlier effective date and the motion for revision based on CUE separately in this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 28, 2010, for the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  This statutory provision is implemented by VA regulation, which provides that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.?

Generally, the effective date for an award of service connection is the day after separation from service or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if the claim is received within one year of the date of separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).?

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has emphasized that an effective date cannot be challenged with a "freestanding" earlier effective date claim.  Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).  Rather, if a claimant wishes to obtain an effective date earlier than that assigned in a rating decision, the claimant must file a timely appeal to that decision awarding the benefit or, under the legacy system, submit new and material evidence within the one-year appeal period.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 20.201, 20.302.  Otherwise, the decision becomes final, and the only basis for challenging the effective date is a motion to revise the decision based on CUE in the decision assigning the effective date, the reversal of which would result in an earlier effective date.  38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105; Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299.?

In this case, by way of background, the Veteran initially submitted a claim for service connection for multiple disabilities, including "nervous condition" in April 1991, within a year of discharge from active service.  She underwent a VA examination in August 1991, during which the examiner noted that she denied nervousness and stated that she did not want to see a psychiatrist.

In November 1991, the RO issued a rating decision which adjudicated the April 1991 claim.  Unfortunately, the RO failed to address the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a nervous condition.  

In December 1997, the Veteran submitted a statement seeking service connection for "PTSD (Rape in service)."  

In March 1998, VA sent the Veteran a letter, cc'ing her then-representative, acknowledging receipt of her claim for service connection for PTSD and requesting specific information in connection with her claim.  A handwritten note on the letter indicates that the Veteran's mailing address had changed; it is unclear to which address the letter was sent, but the letter was not returned as undeliverable.  

In June 1998, the Veteran called VA to report a change of address to yet another mailing address.  A little over a week later, also in June 1998, VA sent a notification letter to the Veteran's old address, cc'ing her then-representative, informing her that her PTSD claim was denied because she did not respond to the March 1998 request for information in connection with her claim.  The letter was not returned as undeliverable.

In January 2010, the Veteran submitted a claim for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU).  Subsequently, in May 2010, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for PTSD.  

In November 2010, the RO issued a rating decision in which it denied service connection for PTSD.  In December 2010, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD) expressing disagreement with the denial of service connection for PTSD.

In October 2012, the RO issued a rating decision in which it granted service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder and assigned a 70 percent rating effective January 28, 2010, the date of the TDIU claim.  The Veteran did not appeal the effective date of the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder, and the decision became final in that regard.

Rating decisions issued in November 2017, July 2019, and February 2021 continued the 70 percent rating assigned for PTSD and bipolar disorder.

In November 2021, the Veteran, through her attorney, submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application listing the issue as "Clear and unmistakable error for effective date of 1/28/2010 granting the service connection for PTSD."  The Veteran did not list a date of VA decision notice but wrote that service treatment records (STRs) had been added to the claims file after the initial decision denying PTSD and referenced a copy of a May 2012 VA 21-2507a Request for Physical Examination she submitted indicating that there was an "arguably open claim pending since April 24, 1991" and providing a procedural history of the Veteran's prior claims, including the unadjudicated claim for a nervous condition.

After careful review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim for an effective date prior to January 28, 2010, for the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder amounts to a freestanding effective date claim, which is subject to dismissal.  If a claimant disagrees with the effective date assigned in a given rating action, the claimant must submit an appeal or request review of the decision within one year of notice of the rating decision assigning the effective date.  A "freestanding" effective date claim is a claim that seeks an earlier effective date for an award where the decision that assigned the effective date for that award has already become final.  As noted above, the Court has held that once a decision assigning an effective date becomes final, that assignment cannot be challenged through a freestanding claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date.  Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299-300.  In Rudd, the Court explained that to allow freestanding effective date claims would vitiate the rule of finality.  Id.  The Board is therefore required to dismiss freestanding claims for entitlement to earlier effective dates.  Id; see also DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52 (2006) (stating there is no such procedure as a freestanding challenge to the finality of a VA decision).

Here, as discussed above, an October 2012 rating decision awarded service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder effective January 28, 2010.  The Veteran did not appeal the effective date assigned for the award of service connection, and new and material evidence pertaining to that issue was not received by VA or constructively in its possession within one year of written notice to the Veteran of the October 2012 decision.  Therefore, with respect to the effective date of the award of service connection, the October 2012 rating decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  To the extent the Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder, where the October 2012 rating decision that assigned the effective date for that award has become final, her claim constitutes a "freestanding" effective date claim and must be dismissed.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's attorney contentions regarding a number of alleged procedural deficiencies that occurred before the October 2012 rating decision in the context of the Veteran's prior claims of entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric condition, including failure to adjudicate the Veteran's original claim for service connection for a nervous condition, lack of proper notice of the June 1998 notification letter due to mailing issues, additional VA medical treatment records associated with the record within one year of the June 1998 notification letter, and the RO's failure to properly handle the claim as one involving military sexual trauma (MST).  See, e.g., February 2022 HLR Informal Conference Worksheet; November 2024 Board hearing transcript.  However, the Veteran had the opportunity to raise such issues to obtain an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder by submitting an appeal within one year of notice of the October 2012 rating decision that assigned the effective date for the award of service connection.  As noted above, the Court has held that once a decision assigning an effective date becomes final, that assignment cannot be challenged through a freestanding claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date.  Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299-300.  The only basis for challenging the effective date in such a situation is a motion to revise, based on CUE, the decision assigning the effective date, the reversal of which would result in an earlier effective date.  38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105; Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299.?

The Board also acknowledges the Veteran's attorney's contention that an earlier effective date is warranted under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) based on receipt of additional STRs following the initial decision denying service connection for PTSD.  Generally, a decision of the RO becomes final if the appellant does not express disagreement or, under the legacy system, submit new and material evidence within one year.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.105(b), 3.156(b), 3.160(d).  However, an exception to this general rule regarding finality arises under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), which provides that if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of the same section (which defines new and material evidence).  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c).  By operation of § 3.156(c), an original claim is not just reopened, it is reconsidered and serves as the date of the claim and the earliest date for which benefits may be granted.  Stowers v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 550, 554 (2014).  However, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that the duty created by § 3.156(c) is extinguished once VA has examined the newly associated service records.  See Blubaugh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  The Federal Circuit in Blubaugh further stated that "subsection (c)(1) does not apply under such circumstances because the VA has already reconsidered the merits of the veteran's claim in light of the relevant service record."  Id.  Here, the Veteran's STRs were reviewed in connection with her claim for service connection for PTSD that was adjudicated in the October 2012 rating decision, which became final; therefore, the duty created by § 3.156(c) was extinguished.

Ultimately, the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder constitutes a freestanding effective date claim and must be dismissed.  Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296.  The Board regrets that it cannot render a favorable decision in this matter.  However, while it is sympathetic to the Veteran, the Board is bound by the law and is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis.  See Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994).

The motion to revise, based on CUE, the effective date of January 28, 2010, for the award of service connection for PTSD and bipolar disorder

As noted above, in November 2021, the Veteran, through her attorney, submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application alleging CUE in the January 28, 2010, effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD.

CUE is a form of collateral attack on an otherwise final decision; it is an avenue by which a claimant may correct an error that was made in an earlier RO rating decision that has become final.  CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error."? It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.? Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE.? Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error."? Fugo v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?40, 43-44 (1993).? In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different.? Id. at 44.?

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).? For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision.? Id.?

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered.? Evans v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3?Vet. App.?310, 313-14 (1992).?

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision.? See Porter v. Brown, 5?Vet. App.?233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999).? A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset.? King v. Shinseki, 26?Vet. App.?433, 441 (2014).? The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different.? Id. at 442.

Any claim of CUE must be pled with specificity.  See Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  A request for revision of a decision based on CUE must be in writing and signed by the requesting party or that party's authorized representative.  The request must include the name of the claimant; the name of the requesting party if other than the claimant; the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number; and the date of the decision to which the request relates.  If the applicable decision involved more than one issue, the request must identify the specific issue, or issues, to which the request pertains.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a)(1)(vii)(A).  The request must set forth clearly and specifically the alleged clear and unmistakable error, or errors, of fact or law in the prior decision, the legal or factual basis for such allegations, and, unless it is the kind of error that, if true, would be CUE on its face, the claimant must also give specific arguments as to why the result of the prior determination would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error.  Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 44; see also Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003); Phillips v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 25 (1997) (distinguishing denial of CUE due to pleading deficiency and denial of CUE on merits).  Non-specific allegations of failure to follow regulations or failure to give due process, or any other general, non-specific allegations of error, are insufficient to satisfy the requirement of the previous sentence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a)(1)(vii)(B).  Assertions of CUE that fail to satisfy the pleading requirements should be dismissed without prejudice to refiling.  Simmons, 17 Vet. App. at 113-14.

In adjudicating a motion to revise a final RO decision based on CUE, the Board must first make a threshold determination as to whether the motion pleads an alleged error of fact or law with sufficient clarity and specificity.  In this case, the Board finds that the Veteran's November 2021 Supplemental Claim does not meet the filing requirements for CUE.  

Here, as noted above, the Veteran's attorney has recounted several procedural deficiencies that occurred in the context of the Veteran's prior claims of entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric condition.  See February 2022 HLR Informal Conference Worksheet; November 2024 Board hearing transcript.  However, neither the Veteran nor her attorney have specifically identified the RO decision alleged to contain CUE or set forth clearly and specifically the alleged clear and unmistakable error, or errors, of fact or law in that decision, the legal or factual basis for such allegations, and why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error.  Therefore, the Veteran has not submitted a request for revision of a prior final decision that comports with the strict filing requirements outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii).  Instead, the November 2021 Supplemental Claim alleges only that the effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD was CUE.  As previously discussed, a motion or request seeking revision of a prior final decision based on CUE is completely separate from a claim seeking an earlier effective date for an award of disability compensation.  Jarrell, 20 Vet. App. 326.  Moreover, it is an "unassailable proposition that merely to aver that there was CUE in a case is not sufficient to raise the issue."  Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 44.  Ultimately, the lack of specificity of the Veteran's request renders it insufficient to raise a cognizable CUE motion; it does not "call[] to the attention of later reviewers [an error that] compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error."  Id. at 43.  In any case, even if the rating decision being challenged could be inferred from context, the RO has not adjudicated, in the first instance, a request for revision of a specific prior final decision based on CUE; therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate such a request.  

The Veteran is invited to submit a motion to revise, based on CUE, a specific prior final rating decision that comports with the strict filing requirements outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a)(1)(vii).  In particular, the Board emphasizes that such a motion must specifically identify the decision and issue being attacked and must plead, with some degree of specificity, the alleged error of fact or law.  Unless it is the kind of error that, if true, would-be CUE on its face, the claimant must also give specific arguments as to why the result of the prior determination would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii); Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 44; see also Phillips, 10 Vet. App. at 25.

?

However, at present, the Veteran has not identified a specific error of fact or law in a specific prior final rating decision or explained how the commission of the alleged error manifestly changed the outcome of that decision.  Therefore, the CUE motion must be dismissed without prejudice to refiling.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
