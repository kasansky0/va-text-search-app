DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran had service in the official waters of Vietnam, and his prostate cancer is related to his active-duty service because of his presumptive exposure to herbicide agents.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for prostate cancer, as due to exposure to herbicide agents, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.313.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1962 to September 1969.  

This matter is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed the portion of the rating decision pertaining to the issue above and requested a hearing before the Board and an opportunity to submit evidence at the hearing and within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  On December 13, 2024, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801.  

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claim of service connection for prostate cancer, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

1. Service Connection for Prostate Cancer

The Veteran contends that he has a prostate cancer condition that was caused by exposure to herbicide agents based on his service in the Republic of Vietnam.  See March 2024 Fully Developed Claim.  

Generally, to establish service connection, a claimant must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

VA laws and regulations provide that a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam war (i.e., January 9, 1962, to May 7, 1975), shall be presumed to have been exposed to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  

The list of diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents includes prostate cancer.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  

In this case, exposure to herbicides agent has been conceded based on the Veteran's service on the waters of the Republic of Vietnam.  See October 2020 VA Memo.  

The Veteran has a diagnosis of prostate cancer.  For example, the record shows a July 2023 private lab report where it was noted that the Veteran had right lateral apex prostate acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and right apex prostate acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  

Given the above, the Board finds that the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran was presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents based on his service in the official waters of Vietnam.  He has a current disability for prostate cancer.  Therefore, the Board concludes that service connection for prostate cancer is warranted, and the claim is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
