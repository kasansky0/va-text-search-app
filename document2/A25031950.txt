ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran's tinnitus is a result of his in-service hazardous noise exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from January 2014 to January 2019.

The Veteran filed his claim of service connection for tinnitus in April 2023. His claim was denied in a February 2024 rating decision. In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110. Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three elements: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after separation when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Certain chronic diseases, including tinnitus, may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree in a specified period of time post-service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. That period of time is usually one year. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(3). For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b), an alternative method of establishing an in-service disease or injury and a nexus for chronic diseases is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); see Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-97 (1997); see also Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 302 (1999). Continuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was "noted" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology. Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 495-96; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

The Board must determine the value of all pertinent lay and medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Lay evidence may be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when: (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition (i.e., when the layperson will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer); (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or; (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377, n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

A veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal," and does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise. Evidence is in approximate balance when the evidence in favor of and opposing the veteran's claim is found to be almost exactly or nearly equal. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Turning to the record, service treatment records show the Veteran denied ringing in his ears in September 2015. In May 2017, the Veteran denied ear trouble, hearing loss, and ringing in his ears. He did not separate until 2019. In his April 2023 claims form, he noted he was assigned duties as aviation mechanic with constant noise exposure from aircraft and engines until 2019. 

Post service treatment records show the Veteran endorsed occasional tinnitus in June 2020. Tinnitus is a condition that is capable of lay observation. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). 

The Veteran was afforded the opportunity to VA examinations in June 2023, August 2023, and February 2024. The Veteran did not appear for any of the scheduled examinations. When a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim and the claimant does not subsequently provide good cause for the failure to do so, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (a), (b).

In the February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable finding: 

"The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during [the Veteran's] service. [His] MOS as a Fixed Wing Aircraft Mechanic FA-18 (6217) and Multisystem Aviation Quality Assurance Representation (6018) have high probabilities for military noise exposure."

Upon review of the record and with resolution of the doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus is warranted. The Veteran had a qualifying in-service event and a post-service diagnosis of tinnitus shortly after his discharge. Therefore, service connection for tinnitus is granted.
