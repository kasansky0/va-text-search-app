DOCKET NO. 240819-467120
DATE: April 7, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service-connection for migraine headaches is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a December 2024 decision, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) granted an effective date of October 13, 2020, the date of receipt of an intent to file, for the award of service-connection for migraine headaches; this is a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to an earlier effective date for service-connection for migraine headaches have been met.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from August 1988 to July 1992. 

The matter comes before the Board on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision that restored the disability rating for migraines to 30 percent, effective June 1, 2023. In an August 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran limited their appeal to requesting an earlier effective date of October 13, 2020, for the grant of service connection for headaches.  AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993). 

By way of procedural background, in December 2024, the Board granted an earlier effective date of October 13, 2020, for service-connection for migraine headaches. See December 2024 BVA Decision.   

As the requested earlier effective date is now in effect, the Board finds the appeal is now moot. Accordingly, there is no case or controversy currently before the Board in this appeal, and it is therefore dismissed.
