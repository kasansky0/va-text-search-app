ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for residual of left pinky finger fracture has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

In a September 2024 written statement, the Veteran withdrew the claim on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for entitlement to service connection for residual of left pinky finger fracture have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2009 to August 2014.

In a March 2021 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction denied a claim for service connection for residual of left pinky finger fracture.  In the April 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In September 2024, the Veteran, through counsel, submitted written correspondence which included the Veteran's name and file number that, in relevant part, sought to withdraw his appeal for service connection for residual of left pinky finger fracture.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).  The Board finds that the statement qualifies as a valid withdrawal of the appeal.  Thus, the Veteran validly withdrew the claim, and the appeal is dismissed.  See generally Hombre v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).
