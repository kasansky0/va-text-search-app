ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbances, as secondary to service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (claimed as secondary to sleep disturbances) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not have a sleep disturbance disorder that is separate and distinct from her service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder, as her sleep disturbance disorder symptoms are already being compensated through her service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder.

2. The persuasive evidence of record shows that the Veteran does not have chronic, clinically diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and it does not cause functional impairment of earning capacity.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbances, as secondary to service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A , 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.310.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (claimed as secondary to sleep disturbances) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service from April 2014 to August 2018.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in-service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in-service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently clarified that, as contemplated by 38 U.S.C. § 1110, secondary aggravation will be shown where a non-service-connected disability would have been less severe "but-for" a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two conditions, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability. See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbances, as secondary to service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder

2. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (claimed as secondary to sleep disturbances)

The Veteran filed a claim for benefits in October 2023. Her new claimed disabilities were for sleep disturbances as secondary to her service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder and obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to her claimed sleep disturbances. See October 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). 

In the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made the following favorable findings for sleep disturbances: 1) participation in toxic risk exposure activity (TERA) is presumed; and 2) the claimed primary disability (acquired psychiatric disorder) is service-connected since August 10, 2018. The only favorable finding for obstructive sleep apnea was that participation in a TERA is presumed. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the remaining questions are whether there was an incident in-service, whether a disability is present, and whether the disabilities are related to service. 

The Board observes that the Veteran's service treatment records are silent as to any complaints of or treatment for or obstructive sleep apnea. There are some notations for sleep disturbances, but they were listed as psychiatric symptoms. Other notations suggest that the Veteran had poor sleep patterns due to medication difficulties. 

The Board notes that while the Veteran's appeal was pending, she was scheduled for a VA examination for her acquired psychiatric disorder, but she failed to report. See February 2024 C&P Exam. When a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim and the claimant does not subsequently provide good cause for his failure to do so, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b). When the examination is scheduled in conjunction with any other original claim, a reopened claim for a benefit that was previously disallowed or a claim for increase, the claim shall be denied. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655. See also Engelke v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 396, 399 (1997); Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307, 311 (1992). No good cause has been raised for missing the examination. 

The Board further notes that during an earlier August 2023 VA psychiatric examination, one of the symptoms listed for her service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder was chronic sleep impairment. This means the Veteran is already being compensated for sleep impairment via a separately service-connected and compensated disability. See Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998) (citing 61 Fed. Reg. 52698 (Oct. 8, 1996)) (when it is not possible to separate the effects of the service-connected and non-service-connected disabilities, the benefit of the doubt doctrine described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 dictates that such signs and symptoms be attributed to the service-connected disability or disabilities).

The Veteran received a VA sleep apnea examination in March 2024. The examiner determined that the Veteran does not have nor has she ever had a diagnosis of sleep apnea. The examiner clarified that the Veteran has sleep disturbances that she believes are due to her service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder. The examiner remarked that the Veteran has never had a sleep study done and any sleep disturbances are only a symptom, not a separate diagnosis. Therefore, a nexus is not established and an additional opinion is not needed. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that there is simply no medical evidence in the record to document a current diagnosis of sleep disturbances and obstructive sleep apnea. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports; however, in order to warrant service connection, the threshold requirement is competent evidence of the existence of the claimed disability at some point during a Veteran's appeal. See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007) (requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied "when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim ... even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim"); Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

In this case, while the Veteran is competent as a layperson to testify to symptoms she experiences, she has not demonstrated that she has the necessary skills, experience, or medical knowledge to diagnose sleep disturbances, obstructive sleep apnea, and/or the residuals thereof; this is a complex medical question. Consequently, the Board concludes that the Veteran's statements and opinions as to diagnosis and etiology are of little probative value. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (explaining in footnote 4 that a Veteran is competent to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition such as a broken leg, but not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions).

The Board has considered Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), in which the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity." Id. at 1367-69. To establish the presence of a disability pursuant to Saunders, there must be competent evidence specific to the claimant tending to show that his or her impairment rises to a level to affect earning capacity, which may include showing manifestations of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person. Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 17 (U.S. 2020). Here, the March 2024 VA examiner found that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea and sleep disturbances are only a symptom of her service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder. Moreover, the Board does not find that any problems claimed to be associated with sleep disturbances and obstructive sleep apnea have had any functional impairment of earning capacity for the Veteran and her acquired psychiatric disorder is properly rated and not currently on appeal. Thus, a separate disability rating for any claimed sleep disturbances would constitute impermissible pyramiding. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the benefit of the doubt rule is not applicable as the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim and is not in approximate balance. Therefore, entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbances, as secondary to service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder and obstructive sleep apnea (claimed as secondary to sleep disturbances) is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
