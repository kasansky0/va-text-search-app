ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected allergic rhinitis (rhinitis) is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is caused by his service-connected allergic rhinitis.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected allergic rhinitis have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1985 to March 2011.    

In November 2023, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review (HLR) Request (VA form 20-0996) to a November 2023 Rating Decision.  In March 2024 the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a HLR Rating Decision, which constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran has continuously pursued his February 2022 claim for service connection for OSA through a series of Supplemental Claims and request for HLR.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected allergic rhinitis

The Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to his service-connected allergic rhinitis, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  See February 2022 Correspondence, November 2022 Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 21-526EZ), July 2024 Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182).  The Veteran also contends that his sleep apnea started in service while deployed in Iraq and is due to service, including an in-service diagnosis of asthma, a disruption of 24-hour sleep cycle, and diagnosis of fatigue.  See February 2022 Correspondence.  His sleep apnea has continued since service and requires the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, due to loud snoring, daytime fatigue, and not breathing while sleeping.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists; and (2) at least one service-connected disability; and (3) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a)-(b).  Secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain.  Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (citations omitted).  Secondary aggravation exists when the non-service-connected disability not caused by a service-connected disability would be less severe were it not for a service-connected disability.  Id. at 1364.   

A lay person is competent to report on the onset and reoccurrence of current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).? The Board must determine, on a?case-by-case?basis, whether a veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In the March 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal, AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and the claimed primary conditions of allergic rhinitis, GERD, and asthma are service connected.  See March 2024 HLR Rating Decision.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Board notes that the Veteran was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis in 2007.  See April 2023 VA Examination.  Therefore, the only question remaining for the Board is whether medical evidence establishes a link between the Veteran's OSA and service or a service-connected disability.  

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds the evidence supports a grant of service connection for OSA as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected allergic rhinitis.  As this represents a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal, the Board will not address entitlement to service connection for OSA on a direct basis or as secondary to service-connected asthma or GERD.

In a February 2022 statement, the Veteran explained that he was diagnosed with moderate OSA, based on an at-home test on December 10, 2021.  See February 2022 Correspondence.  The Veteran stated he believed that his OSA is caused by his asthma, first diagnosed in December 2007 and July 2008.  The Veteran was also found a diagnosis of disruption of a 24-hour sleep cycle and a diagnosis of fatigue in July 2009, while he was deployed in Iraq.  When he was deployed to Iraq from December 2008 to December 2009, he noticed difficulty sleeping much of the time, even though he was always tired from working up to 16 hours a day and 8 on Sundays.  He often found himself waking up grasping for air and feeling scared.  He thought it was stress because he often had incoming rocket fire with warning alarms going off at night.  This required him to get out of bed quickly and run to a bomb shelter.  He would wake up with his heart pounding, even though no alarm was going off.  The Veteran talked to a doctor in 2009, but received no treatment that he could recall.  When he returned from Iraq in December 2009, he was no longer worried about rocket attacks and thought he would sleep better.  He would wake up many times at night due to snoring but did not think it was serious.  His wife would constantly wake him up and tell him he was snoring and that he would stop breathing.  His two children claimed they could hear him snoring throughout the entire house.  His snoring continued untreated for years.  In August 2021, he was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFIB), which caused him to be concerned.  During a doctor's appointment, he was asked about his snoring, and he told the provider that he snored, and his wife always complained.  He also told the provider he was always tired throughout the day, after which he was referred for a sleep study.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2022, where the examiner confirmed a diagnosis of OSA.  The examiner recognized that the Veteran was previously diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, noting the prior treatment records.  The examiner opined that the claimed condition is at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater probability) proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected condition.  The examiner reasoned that the medical record notes from a sleep study performed January 2022 show severe sleep apnea.  The condition is contributed by obstructive symptoms which may include rhinitis.  His pulmonary function test (PFT) test performed for this exam is abnormal and may be suggestive of a chronic respiratory condition.  Chest x-ray was normal.  The examiner concluded that based on medical record review and current assessment, the Veteran's OSA is as least as likely as not incurred in or caused by complaints of respiratory condition for exam purposes.  

Based on this examination, in a November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran's OSA is secondary to his then non-service-connected respiratory condition (claimed as allergic rhinitis and asthma).  

In June 2023, the AOJ service-connected the Veteran's allergic rhinitis and asthma as directly related to service. 

Despite the favorable finding and positive nexus opinion, the AOJ requested another VA examination and opinion which were provided in November 2023.  That VA examiner opined that OSA is less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event or illness per review of service treatment records (STRs) as dated evidence was found for complaints of allergic rhinitis.  The examiner reasoned that risk factors for OSA include excess weight.  Most but not all people with OSA are overweight.  Fat deposits around the upper airway can obstruct breathing.  Medical conditions that are associated with obesity, such as hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome, also can cause OSA.  Older age.  The risk of OSA increases as you age but appears to level off after your 60s and 70s.  Narrowed airway.   A naturally narrow airway is a trait that can be passed down in your family, or your tonsils or adenoids might become enlarged and block your airway.  High blood pressure, known as hypertension.  OSA is relatively common in people with hypertension.  Chronic nasal congestion.  OSA occurs twice as often in those who have consistent nasal congestion at night, regardless of the cause.  Smoking.   People who smoke are more likely to have OSA.  Diabetes.  OSA might be more common in people with diabetes.  Male sex.  In general, men are 2 to 3 times more likely as premenopausal women to have obstructive sleep apnea.  However, the risk of OSA increases in women after menopause.  A family history of sleep apnea.  Having family members with OSA might increase your risk.  Asthma.  Research has found an association between asthma and the risk of OSA.  The examiner concluded that per this information, the claimed OSA is less likely than not incurred in or caused by the rhinitis during service.  

The Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable finding linking the Veteran's OSA to his now service-connected respiratory disorder, as the AOJ has not withdrawn this favorable finding nor is it rebutted by clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Moreover, the Board finds the July 2022 VA medical opinion more probative than the November 2023 VA medical opinion.  The November 2023 VA medical opinion is inadequate as it failed to adequately address the etiology of the Veteran's OSA.  The November 2023 opinion did not provide sufficient rationale as the examiner did not state what factors applied to the Veteran and to what degree of severity each factor contributed to the OSA.  See McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243, 256 (2019) (To be adequate, a medical opinion must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) ("It is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion... that contributes probative value to a medical opinion").  Further, the November 2023 examiner did not consider the Veteran's medical history of continuous sleep issues since service or his rhinitis VA examinations.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007) (an opinion is inadequate when the examiner does not consider the Veteran's medical history).  In the April 2023 rhinitis VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran has difficulty breathing, allergies year-round, an obstructed left nostril, and flare-ups of congestion.  See April 2023 VA Examination.  A May 2023 VA examiner indicated that a current symptom of the Veteran's rhinitis is sleep apnea.  See May 2023 VA Examination.  Additionally, the November 2023 VA examiner did not opine whether the Veteran's OSA was aggravated by his service-connected rhinitis.  See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013) (a medical opinion is inadequate when it fails to adequately address the question of aggravation).  These deficiencies render the November 2023 VA opinion inadequate for adjudication purposes.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, supra.  Therefore, the opinion is accorded little probative weight.  

In contrast, the July 2022 VA examiner considered the accurate history of the Veteran's OSA condition, including the Veteran's medical history regarding his rhinitis.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's OSA was caused by "complaints of respiratory condition for exam purposes."  While awkwardly phrased, the opinion and examination together clearly provide a positive nexus with supportive rationale.  The July 2022 VA examination opinion and disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) identifies the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, which is consistent with the prior diagnosis of that disorder, and it references that rhinitis is secondary to OSA in providing the positive nexus.  Thus, the Board gives the July 2022 VA examination high probative weight.    

For the above reasons, the probative evidence of the record persuasively weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's sleep apnea is due to his service-connected allergic rhinitis.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine therefore does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected allergic rhinitis is warranted, and the claim is granted.
