REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1980 to August 1982.

The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the rating decision on appeal in May 2024, which constitutes an initial decision. Therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of ED, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is remanded.

Although the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) is conceded, no data exists on the Veteran's Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER). See May 2024 rating decision; ILER correspondence. The clinician conducted the TERA opinion without any data in the ILER. See May 2024 VA medical opinion. Without such a record, potentially relevant facts on which to establish exposure, and thus find a direct nexus, may be missing from the claims file. Once undertaken, an examination must be adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). The AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate etiology opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error that necessitates a remand for development.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate an ILER with the record.

2. After the above development, obtain a VA addendum medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's disability. The VA examiner must consider the following:

(a.) Is the Veteran's disability at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to the Veteran's in-service toxic exposures, to include in-service toxic exposures due to solvents and/or any other identified MOS exposures? When providing this opinion, the examiner must consider:

(1) The total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and (2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

3. Is it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's disabilities are directly related to his military service?
