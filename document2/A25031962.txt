ORDER

Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

Service connection for cardiomyopathy is denied.

Service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED) is denied.

Service connection for a major depressive disorder (MDD) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran served on active duty from October 1986 to February 1994.

2. PTSD has not been related to a confirmed inservice stressor.

3. Cardiomyopathy, ED, and MDD were not shown in service, are not etiologically related to service, and are not caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. PTSD was not incurred in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1131, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2024).

2. Cardiomyopathy was not incurred in service nor is it secondary to a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310 (2024).

3. ED was not incurred in service nor is it secondary to a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310 (2024).

4. MDD was not incurred in service nor is it secondary to a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

This decision has been written under the guidelines of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claims. In June 2024, the Veteran appealed to the Board via a Form 10182 and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Turning to the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted on a direct basis as a result of disease or injury incurred in service based on nexus using a three-element test: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a), (d); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for a disability which is aggravated by, proximately due to, or the result of a service-connected disease or injury under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995). In order to establish service connection on a secondary basis, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical evidence establishing a link between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

PTSD

With specific regard to PTSD claims, three elements must be present: (1) a current medical diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); (2) medical evidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and a claimed in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).

The record shows that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD. As such, the first element of service connection has been met. With regard to an inservice stressor, he indicated in a February 2016 VA treatment record that he participated in combat in Kuwait and Somalia. A March 2016 VA treatment record reflected that he indicated he was accidentally shot while serving in Somalia. 

Further in a September 2013 VA treatment record, the Veteran stated that he served two tours in Iraq and one in Somalia. A January 2020 VA examination report noted that he reported serving in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Somalia and that he served in combat. 

However, the service personnel records (SPRs) do not support the claimed stressors. Notably, the SPRs do not contain any indicators or markers of combat or any traumatic event and they only reflect overseas service in Germany and Korea. While the Veteran submitted (in October 2022) a document dated in November 1993 that appears to indicate that he was arriving early from Somalia, this information is not found in the official SPR file and is not confirmed by any of the SPRs. 

In July 2019, the Veteran submitted a request for correction of military records, indicating that he served in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Somalia during Desert Storm; however, the May 2021 written response from the Army Board of Correction of Military Records stated that he had no service in Southwest Asia and noted only service in Korea (from May 1987 to June 1988) and Germany (from September 1989 to July 1992). 

Further, the service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect any related complaints, the separation examination report reflected normal psychiatric evaluation, and the separation Report of Medical History noted that the Veteran denied nervous trouble, depression or excessive worry, and frequent trouble sleeping.

As such, while there is a current diagnosis, the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding of credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor, including the assertion of serving in combat, actually occurred. Thus, the appeal is denied.

Cardiomyopathy, ED, and MDD

The Veteran has claimed that cardiomyopathy, ED and MDD are secondary to PTSD. As service connection for PTSD has been denied in this decision, there is no basis to grant the claims on a secondary basis.

Next, the Veteran has not indicated, and the medical evidence does not show, that any of these claimed disorders were incurred in service or for many years after service. In addition, there is no lay or medical evidence that the disorders are otherwise causally or etiologically related to service. As such, service connection is not warranted on any other basis.

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements that PTSD was caused by service and cardiomyopathy, ED and MDD are secondary to PTSD. While he is competent to report symptoms as this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses, he is not competent to offer an opinion as to the etiology of the current disorders due to the medical complexity of the matters involved. 

In sum, after a careful review of the record, the evidence weighs persuasively against the claims for service connection and there is no doubt to be resolved. As such, the appeals are denied.  

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, for the Board's consideration. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
