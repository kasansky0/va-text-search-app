ORDER

1. Service connection for hypertension is denied.

2. Service connection for renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's hypertension did not begin during active service, did not manifest in the year following discharge from service and is not otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease, including exposure to herbicide agents.   

2. The Veteran's kidney cancer did not begin during active service, did not manifest in the year following discharge from service and is not otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease, including exposure to herbicide agents.   

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309(e), 3.313.

2. The criteria for service connection for kidney cancer have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309(e), 3.313.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from August 1966 to August 1969. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) and elected a hearing. In December 2024, the Veteran withdrew the request for a hearing and instead elected to submit evidence. 

As the hearing request was withdrawn pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.704(e), the Board's decision will be based on a review of evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's decision on the issues on appeal and evidence submitted within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If additional evidence was submitted between the dates of the AOJ decision and the date the hearing request is withdrawn, the Board will not consider it unless it is resubmitted during the 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal request. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023). 

The Veteran contends that his hypertension and kidney cancer are due to his military service. Specifically, that the Veteran contends that his hypertension and kidney cancer should be service-connected due to exposure to an herbicide agent during service in the coastal waters near the Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam).  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for certain diseases resulting from exposure to herbicide agents for Veterans who, during active military, naval or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam between January 1962 and May 1975, so long as the requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 1116 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(iii) are met, and the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1113 and 38C.F.R. §3.307 (d) are also satisfied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e). The Blue Water Navy (BWN) Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 extended the presumption of herbicide exposure, such as Agent Orange, to Veterans who served in the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam within 12 nautical miles off the coast of Vietnam between Jan. 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975.

On August 10, 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act (PACT Act) was signed into law indicating sufficient medical evidence that hypertension can be associated with herbicide agent exposure. As such, hypertension is a disease for which presumptive service connection based on exposure to an herbicide agent may be granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e); Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (PACT Act).

Favorable findings included in the rating decisions of record are binding on the Board. They include that the Veteran has been diagnosed with both disabilities at issue and that participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (asbestos) is conceded. Also, hypertension is a presumptive condition associated with herbicide agent exposure and the Veteran has sufficient military service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection. 

The Veteran has reported being diagnosed with hypertension shortly after his service. At an August 2022 Board hearing, the Veteran provided sworn testimony that he was first prescribed blood pressure medication around age 24 and he had left military service at age 22. At a February 2024 VA exam, the Veteran reported the onset of his hypertension as being within months of exiting the service; that examiner noted the Veteran's blood pressure at separation was 140/86; however, one elevated blood pressure reading does not substantiate a diagnosis of hypertension. The earliest record of a diagnosis of hypertension in the Veteran's medical records is May 2019. See CAPRI of August 7, 2019. 

Thus, the crux of this case is whether the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while on active duty to establish presumptive service connection for hypertension or whether direct service connection is established for either disability at issue.

The Veteran's military records show he served with Fighter Squadron 102 on board the USS America from May 12 to November 20, 1968. The USS American was conducting combat operations in Southeast Asia from April to October 1968. 

The Veteran provided a photograph which he purports to be the USS America off the coastal waters of Vietnam; however, what country's coast is depicted in that photo cannot be ascertained. See VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim of July 24, 2019. 

At the August 2022 Board hearing noted above, the Veteran provided sworn testimony that from the USS America he observed the USS New Jersey in a gunfight with Vietnam in late September 1968 and he estimated being about eight miles offshore, but possibly only five or six miles offshore; therefore, he would have been within the 12 miles required for presumptive service connection. 

However, there is no evidence in the Veteran's personnel file that he was deployed or stationed in Vietnam, served within 12 nautical miles off the coast of Vietnam, or that he was otherwise personally exposed to any herbicide agent during service. 

The VA has made numerous attempts at development of the Veteran's contention that he was exposed to an herbicide agent during service. The Board has reviewed the logbooks and photographs provided by the Veteran. The Board also obtained a January 19, 2024, Records Research Center response which said that their classified researcher was unable to confirm the exposure claimed by the Veteran; however, due to the classification of the response no further correspondence or documents are forthcoming. The VA also obtained the available command histories for Fighter Squadron 102 and USS America. 

An April 2024 VA Toxic Exposure Risk Activity Memorandum (TERA) found the Veteran was exposed to asbestos but not to any herbicide agents. 

In February 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA exam for his hypertension. The examiner provided a negative medical opinion, noting that the earliest indication of a hypertension diagnosis in the Veteran's records is from May 2019 and there was no evidence of nexus with the Veteran's service. 

In April 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA exam for his hypertension. The examiner provided a negative medical opinion specific to the Veteran's TERA of asbestos exposure. 

In April 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA exam for his kidney cancer. The examiner provided a negative medical opinion specific to the Veteran's TERA of asbestos exposure.

The Board finds the evidence fails to support that the Veteran served within 12 nautical miles of Vietnam and thus the Veteran is not entitled to presumptive service connection due to herbicide agent exposure during service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e).

Where a presumption of service connection is not satisfied, a claimant may nonetheless provide direct evidence of the in-service injury, disease, or event. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1044 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

The Veteran does not indicate his hypertension or kidney cancer are related to his active-duty service other than as a result of exposure to herbicide agents. The April 2024 VA exams found no medical nexus between the Veteran's service, to include his in-service exposure to asbestos. 

The Board notes that hypertension is among the "chronic diseases" for which other presumptions are available. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.309(a). In order to benefit from the chronic disease presumptions, the evidence must show either that the disease was "chronic" in service, has been continuously symptomatic since service, or manifest to a compensable degree within one year of service separation. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307(a).

The Veteran was not diagnosed with hypertension during service. He had one elevated blood pressure reading near separation; however, the examiner indicated that one elevated blood pressure reading does not support a clinical diagnosis. Although the Veteran claims to have received medication for hypertension within months of service or within approximately two years of service, there are no medical records in support of that contention. The earliest medical record showing a diagnosis of hypertension was in May 2019, approximately 50 years after the Veteran's service. Although the Veteran contends that his hypertension was caused by service, and while he is competent to report his readily observable symptoms, he has not shown to have the expertise needed to provide an opinion on a complex medical question such as a diagnosis of as the etiology of hypertension, including whether the condition was caused by, or related to, military service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2), Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Additionally, he has not provided any medical evidence relating the claimed hypertension to service, including exposure to herbicide agents. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's service treatment records and VA medical treatment records are entitled to more probative value than his unsupported lay statements. As there is no medical evidence to support a finding that the disability was present in service, continuously symptomatic since service, or manifest within one year of the Veteran's separation from service, the Board concludes that the chronic disease presumptions are not met.

The Board finds the evidence of record persuasively supports that the Veteran's hypertension and kidney cancer were not related to, or caused by, his military service. The Veteran has not provided any competent evidence in support of his contentions that he was exposed to herbicide agents. Therefore, the Board concludes that service connection for hypertension and for kidney cancer may not be awarded on the basis of exposure to herbicide agents. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1116B.

As stated above, there also is no evidence of record that service connection for hypertension and for kidney cancer have been established on a direct basis. 

The Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine, however as the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, the doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Accordingly, service connection for hypertension and kidney cancer is denied.
