DOCKET NO. 230803-366995
DATE: April 7, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from August 1967 to March 1970 and from September 1979 to August 1991.

A claim for TDIU was filed in January 2021 and denied in a March 2021 rating decision. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) in March 2022. A March 2022 HLR rating decision identified a duty to assist error, and returned the claim to the supplemental decision review option for additional development. The claim was again denied in an August 2022 supplemental rating decision. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in August 2023. 

In the August 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 12, 2024. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the December 12, 2024 hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. §?20.302. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded. 

Following a grant of service connection by the Board, the RO is responsible for implementing the award and assigning a disability rating and effective date in the first instance. Most recently, the March 10, 2025 Board decision granted service connection for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity and left lower extremity. The assignment of a disability rating and effective date for the issues granted in the March 10, 2025 Board decision (Docket No. 20-30 759) impacts a decision on the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, and so the issues are inextricably intertwined. A remand of the claim for TDIU is warranted. Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Assign disability ratings and effective dates in the first instance for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity and left lower extremity, as granted in the March 10, 2025 Board decision (Docket No. 20-30 759). Thereafter, readjudicate the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a TDIU.
