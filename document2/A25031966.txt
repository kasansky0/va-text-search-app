ORDER

The appeal of service connection for glaucoma, right eye, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran served on active duty from September to December 1995, June 1997 to March 1999, February to July 2020, and February to May 2021. He also had additional service in the National Guard.

2. The February 2024 rating decision which the Veteran appealed deferred (did not decide) the issue of service connection for glaucoma; therefore, there is no justiciable issue on appeal in this appeal stream.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal of service connection for glaucoma, right eye, is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) deferred (did not decide) the issue of service connection for right eye glaucoma for a medical opinion. In April 2024, the Veteran appealed to the Board via a Form 10182 and elected the Direct Review docket. In February 2025, he revoked his representation by California Department of Veterans Affairs and is now unrepresented.

Generally, the Board's jurisdiction is predicated upon an appeal having been filed on an issue or issues in controversy. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.7, 20.101. Here, the Veteran appealed an issue that had not yet been adjudicated (deferred) by the AOJ. As this was not a final AOJ decision as to right eye glaucoma, there is no allegation of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration because the issue of service connection was not adjudicated. Accordingly, there is no justiciable issue and the appeal is dismissed.

Parenthetically, issue of service connection for right eye glaucoma was subsequently adjudicated and denied in an April 2024 rating decision; however, this rating decision was separately appealed and is the subject of a different appeal stream with a different docket number (240428-436056) and will be addressed in a separate Board decision. Nothing in this decision impacts the development of the issue in the other appeal stream.

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, for the Board's consideration. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
