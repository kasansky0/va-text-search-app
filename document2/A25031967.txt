FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a February 2020 rating decision, the AOJ continued a 10 percent evaluation for the Veteran's degenerative disc disease and degenerative joint disease of the cervical spine. The Veteran did not file an appeal, nor was new and material evidence received within one year of that decision.

2. The Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ, on September 3, 2020, for an increased rating for his service-connected degenerative disc disease and degenerative joint disease of the cervical spine. In a March 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted an increased 20 percent rating for this disability, effective September 3, 2020.

3. There is no probative evidence that an increase in the Veteran's service-connected degenerative disc disease and degenerative joint disease of the cervical spine preceded his September 3, 2020, application by a year or less.

4. VA received the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for migraines on May 5, 2021; prior to May 5, 2021, there is no formal nor informal claim for entitlement to service connection for migraines. 

5. The Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of hearing loss for VA purposes in either ear.

6. Resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to his active service.

7. The Veteran's left knee disabilities first manifested many years after service and have not otherwise been found to be related to his service; nor are they caused or aggravated by service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to September 3, 2020, for the assignment of an increased 20 percent rating for in the Veteran's service-connected degenerative disc disease and degenerative joint disease of the cervical spine have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to May 9, 2021, for the grant of service connection for migraines have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

5. The criteria for service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patellae, to include as secondary to his service-connected disabilities, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1990 to February 1997. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of March 2022 and September 2022 decisions. In January 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2022 and September 2022 decisions. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 and September 2022 decisions and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window. 

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 and September 2022 AOJ decisions, respectively, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Earlier Effective Date

According to applicable law and regulation, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based upon an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The date of entitlement to an award of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

The effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r). Thus, once a previous decision has become final, the earliest effective date of service connection generally is the date of the petition to reopen rather than the date of the initial claim. Exceptions to this rule include a later grant of service connection based in whole or in part on newly obtained service department records under certain circumstances, as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), and when the decision is revised or reversed on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), as provided in 38 U.S.C. § 5109A(a) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).

A "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Any communication indicating an intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). An informal claim must identify the benefits sought; and upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of the receipt of the informal claim. Id. 

The general rule for claims for increased ratings is that the award is effective the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). The effective date of an award of increased compensation is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date, otherwise, the date of receipt of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). 

An exception to that rule provides that the effective date of an award of an increase shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if application is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

However, if, at any time after the VA issues a decision on a claim, the VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when the VA first decided the claim, the VA will reconsider the claim, notwithstanding the subsection addressing reopening claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3). Service department records that are relevant to the claimed in-service event, injury, or disease, are such § 3.156(c) records. However, to qualify as such records, the award of benefits must be based at least in part on the records. Additionally, this does not apply to records that the VA could not have obtained when it decided the claim because the records did not exist when the VA decided the claim, or because the claimant failed to provide sufficient information for the VA to identify and obtain the records.

Significantly, if the claim is granted based on such service department records, the award is to be effective on the date entitlement arose or the date the VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this part applicable to the previously decided claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3).

Although a claimant need not identify the benefit sought "with specificity," see Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199-200 (1992), some intent on the part of the Veteran to seek benefits must be demonstrated. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998). See also Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-7 (1995) (noting that while VA must interpret a claimant's submissions broadly, VA is not required to conjure up issues not raised by claimant). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has emphasized VA has a duty to develop a Veteran's claim fully and sympathetically to its optimum. Hodge v. West, 155 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1998). This duty requires VA to "determine all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations," Roberson v. West, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and extends to giving a sympathetic reading to all pro se pleadings of record. Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for a disability. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998). The effective date of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but rather, on the date the application was filed with VA. Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999).

When all the evidence is assembled, the Secretary is then responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Assignment of a 20 percent rating for degenerative disc disease and degenerative joint disease of the cervical spine, effective September 3, 2020

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than September 3, 2020, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for his degenerative disc disease and degenerative joint disease of the cervical spine. Specifically, he argues that the effective date should be no later than January 21, 2020, the date from which his increased rating for his cervical spine disability had been continuously prosecuted. See Request for Higher Level Review, VA Form 20-0996, October 10, 2022.

By way of history, the Veteran filed the initial claim for entitlement to service connection for a back condition that was received by VA in October 2007. See VA Form 21-526, October 2, 2007. The claim was denied in a May 2008 rating decision. The Veteran was provided notice of this decision and his appellate rights but did not appeal the decision or submit new and material evidence within one year of the decision. Therefore, the decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103. 

Thereafter, the Veteran filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for lumbar strain in April 2012. See VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim, April 20, 2012. The claim was granted in a July 2012 rating decision. The Veteran was provided notice of this decision and his appellate rights but did not appeal the effective date or assigned evaluation. Furthermore, new and material evidence was not submitted within one year of the decision. Therefore, the decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103.

The Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ, in January 2020 for an increased rating for his cervical spine disability. The claim was denied in a February 2020 rating decision. The Veteran was provided notice of this decision and his appellate rights but did not appeal the decision or submit new and material evidence within one year of the decision. Therefore, the decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103. 

The Veteran filed a subsequent Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ, on September 3, 2020. Following an October 20221 VA examination, the AOJ awarded a 20 percent evaluation in a May 2022 rating decision, effective September 3, 2020, the date of claim.

After careful review, the Board finds that the record does not reflect that the Veteran initiated any appeal of the February 2020 rating decision that denied an increased rating for the service-connected cervical spine disability. He did not file a timely NOD, and his September 2020 claim is thus an attempt to obtain reconsideration of the February 2020 rating decision as opposed to alleging an error in it and requesting a substantive appeal of the decision. In fact, the Veteran has never filed a NOD prior to the January 2024 VA Form 10182 on appeal. Furthermore, new and material evidence was not received within a year of the February 2020 rating decision. As such, the Board finds that there has been no continuous prosecution and the February 2020 rating decision issued prior to the September 3, 2020, claim is final. 

In addition, the record does not establish that an increase in the Veteran's neck disability preceded his application by a year or less. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). The Veteran's degenerative disc disease and degenerative joint disease of the cervical spine is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242. Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 40 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. 

A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.

A 30 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine to 15 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine. 

A 40 percent disability rating is provided for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.

A 100 percent disability rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

The evidence outlining the functional impairment stemming from the frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's service-connected thoracolumbar spine disability in the year prior to his September 2020 claim is reflected in his VA treatment records, the report of VA examination completed in February 2020, and his lay statements. Applying the pertinent medical evidence to the rating criteria, the most limited flexion of the thoracolumbar spine, to include on active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing positions, after repetitive motion testing, was to 45 degrees, but no less, at the February 2020 VA examination.

Further review of the record shows that the Veteran receives VA treatment providers for various disabilities, to include his low back disorder. However, there is no indication from the treatment notes of record that the Veteran has reported low back disorder symptoms nor range of motion measurements that are worse than those noted above. 

The Board observes that flexion limited to 45 degrees does not meet the criteria for an evaluation in excess of 10 percent under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.

Applying the pertinent medical evidence to the rating criteria, the most limited flexion of the thoracolumbar spine, to include on active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing positions, after repetitive motion testing, was to 65 degrees, but no less, at the February 2020 VA examination. The Board observes that flexion limited to 65 degrees does not meet the criteria for an evaluation in excess of 10 percent under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine. 

The Board has considered whether an effective date prior to August 5, 2020 is warranted under the "look-back" provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) and concludes that it is not. In that regard, there is no lay or medical evidence of record received within a year of August 5, 2020 that showed symptoms associated with a higher rating. Moreover, the RO assigned the 20 percent rating for a low back disorder, based on the results contained within a May 2021 VA examination report. Thus, the Board finds that it had not become factually ascertainable that the Veteran's low back disorder had increased in severity to warrant the higher 20 percent rating prior to August 5, 2020. 

Ultimately, based on the laws and regulations previously cited, and after reviewing the totality of the evidence, the Board finds that an effective date prior to August 5, 2020 for the assignment of the 20 percent rating for a low back disorder is not warranted. Importantly, the pertinent regulations specifically state that the effective date should be the date of a claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In the instant case, based on these regulations, the effective dates have been appropriately assigned as the date of the receipt of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for a low back disorder. 

While sympathetic to the Veteran's belief that an earlier effective date is warranted, for the reasons outlined above, the Board is precluded by law from assigning the effective date prior to prior to August 5, 2020 for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for the low back disorder.

In sum, the Board finds that September 3, 2020, is the earliest possible effective date for the grant of the increased 20 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected degenerative disc disease and degenerative joint disease of the cervical spine. Consequently, the claim for an earlier effective date must be denied.

Grant of service connection for migraines, prior to May 9, 2021

The Veteran was granted service connection for migraines in a September 2021 rating decision. An effective date of May 9, 2021, was assigned because it was the date VA received the Veteran's claim. 

As noted, in general, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after disallowance, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Board has reviewed the Veterans claims folder and can find no indication that there was a pending, unadjudicated claim for service connection prior to May 9, 2021. See Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198-200 (1992). The Veteran has also not pointed to any communication or document that could serve as an earlier, unadjudicated claim for benefits.

Having determined that the Veteran's claim on appeal was filed on May 9, 2021, the Board must now determine when entitlement to service connection arose. As noted, an effective date is assigned based on the date of the receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Thus, even if the Veteran had been experiencing symptoms following his separation from service, his May 9, 2021, claim is clearly the later of the two dates specified by law. Hence, on this record, an earlier effective date is not assignable by law. See id.

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Service connection for certain chronic diseases such as arthritis may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). In such cases, the disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even though there is no evidence of that disease during the period of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a). The term "chronic disease" refers to those diseases listed under section 1101(3) of the statute and section 3.309(a) of VA regulations. 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Where a chronic disease under 3.309(a) is "shown as such in service" ("meaning clearly diagnosed beyond legitimate question," Walker, 708 F.3d at 1339) or in the presumptive period so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). In cases where a chronic disease is "shown as such in service," the Veteran is "relieved of the requirement to show a causal relationship between the condition in service and the condition for which service connected disability compensation is sought." Walker, 708 F.3d at 1336. 

Instead, service connection may be granted for subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease without any evidence of link or connection between the chronic disease shown in service and manifestations of the same disease at a later time. In other words, "there is no 'nexus' requirement for compensation for a chronic disease which was shown in service, so long as there is an absence of intercurrent causes to explain post-service manifestations of the chronic disease." Id.

If evidence of a chronic condition is noted during service or during the presumptive period, but the chronic condition is not "shown to be chronic, or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned," i.e., "when the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported," then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required to support a claim for disability compensation for the chronic disease. Proven continuity of symptomatology establishes the link, or nexus, between the current disease and service, and serves as the evidentiary tool to confirm the existence of the chronic disease while in service or a presumptive period during which existence in service is presumed." Walker, 703 F.3d at 1336; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Bilateral Hearing Loss

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss as etiologically related to acoustic trauma sustained during his active service. See VA Form 21-526EZ, August 5, 2020. 

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 or 4000 hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Even if disabling loss is not demonstrated at separation, a veteran many establish service connection for a current hearing disability by submitting evidence that a current disability is causally related to service. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 160 (1993).

The Veteran's DD214 reflects that his Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) was Cannon Crewmember.

The Veteran received a VA examination in January 2021. Pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	25	20	15	20

LEFT	15	20	15	20	25

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear and 98 percent in the left ear. Based on these results, the examiner found normal hearing bilaterally.

The record does not include evidence of a pure tone threshold of 40 decibels or greater at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz; pure tone thresholds of 26 decibels or greater at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz; or any speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's MOS and notes the AOJ's favorable finding that the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise. See Rating Decision - Narrative, September 18, 2021. Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). However, whether the Veteran has a disability due to impaired hearing for VA purposes is clearly defined by regulations. Unfortunately, the evidence shows the Veteran did not have a hearing disability for VA purposes. Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service-connected benefits to cases where there is a current disability. "In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim." Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). 

As the record does not reflect current bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes, the cornerstone element of service connection has not been met, and service connection is not warranted. See Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer, 3 Vet. App. 223. No further discussion of the remaining elements is necessary. The Board acknowledges the Court's holding in Saunders but does not find a basis for determining that there is functional impairment related to a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d. 1356 (2018). Moreover, the Veteran did not allege manifestations of similar severity, frequency and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person. Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8 (2020).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contentions that he has bilateral hearing loss due to exposure to loud noises during service. See August 2020 Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ. He is competent to describe impaired hearing, which is within the realm of his personal experience. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Nonetheless, determining whether a hearing loss disability exists, as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, is not a simple medical determination because the diagnosis is based on results of audiology testing. A hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 is also not a condition under case law that has been found to be capable of lay observation. For these reasons, the Veteran, as a layperson, is not competent to state that his level of impaired hearing reaches the level of the legal standards of a hearing loss disability for the purpose of VA disability compensation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

In sum, the evidence fails to establish that the Veteran has bilateral hearing loss disability as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 for VA compensation purposes. In the absence of the claimed disability, service connection may not be granted. See Brammer, 3 Vet. App. 223; see also Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Gilpin v. Brown, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (service connection cannot be granted if the claimed disability does not exist).

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted. The appeal is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Tinnitus

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for tinnitus as etiologically related to acoustic trauma sustained during his active service. 

The Veteran received a VA examination in January 2021 and reported that tinnitus began during service following exposure to loud sounds like gun and howitzer fire. Based on the results of the examination, the examiner concluded that the condition was less likely than not caused by or a result of military service. Service treatment records indicated no significant shift in hearing thresholds greater than normal measurement variability from entrance to separation and there was no evidence of permanent auditory damage on active duty. Furthermore, there was no complaint of tinnitus during service or at separation. While there was conceded excessive noise exposure on active duty, there was no nexus of auditory damage on active duty to relate the current report of tinnitus to military noise exposure. The examiner also opined, however, that, taking into consideration the Veteran's medical history, clinical findings, onset, and duration of tinnitus, she was unable to determine the etiology of tinnitus without resorting to mere speculation. 

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms of tinnitus, i.e., ringing of the ears, on the basis of his own lay assertions. See, e.g., Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).

Given the statements from the Veteran, combined with the conceded noise exposure from his working as a Canon Crewmember during service, the Board finds that the Veteran's assertions of tinnitus dating back to active service are credible. Thus, such statements establish continuous and chronic symptoms such as to enable a grant of service connection for tinnitus.

The Board acknowledges that the January 2021 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus is not related to military service. The VA examiner's conclusion is a medical conclusion that the Board cannot ignore or disregard, see Willis v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 66 (1991); however, the Board is free to assess medical evidence and is not compelled to accept a medical opinion. See Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614 (1992). The Veteran is also credible to provide lay statements as to the onset of tinnitus. In this regard, the Board emphasizes that tinnitus is a completely subjective condition. The Board affords the January 2021 VA medical opinion low probative weight. The VA medical examiner did not provide an opinion supported by a clear rationale. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). 

Accordingly, resolving the benefit of the doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Left Knee

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for a left knee disorder as etiologically related to his active service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his left knee was caused by injuries due to heavy lifting, excessive running and climbing, and combat training. See VA Form 21-526EZ,August 5, 2020. He also contends that he hurt his knees during service when military police threw him to the ground. See VA Form 21-526EZ,September 2, 2021. 

Service treatment records reflect that the Veteran was apprehended by military policy, handcuffed, choked, and thrown to the ground in December 1991. He complained of bruising to the left knee and the examiner noted a dime-sized abrasion inferior to the patella and mid-line tibia. Furthermore, on his December 1996 separation Report of Medical History, the Veteran reported swollen and painful knees. 

The Veteran received a VA examination in April 2012 but the examiner did not note a diagnosis of a left knee disability. The Veteran had bilateral knee problems since service, with pain that would "come and go." He was involved in a motor vehicle accident in January 1997 while on leave and struck both of his knees on the dashboard. At the time of the examination, he only complained of soreness in the left knee. 

The Veteran received a VA examination in July 2018 and the examiner noted a diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome. The symptoms began in 1998 while running with 75 pound rucksacks up and down a hill. 

The Veteran received a VA examination in February 2021 and the examiner noted diagnoses of patellofemoral pain syndrome, degenerative arthritis, and chondromalacia patellae. The Veteran recalled having knee pain beginning in 1988 or 1989 after getting involved in a fight in a nightclub. He was arrested and thrown to the ground by military police. Based on the results of the examination, the examiner opined that the condition was less likely than not caused by service. Service treatment records noted a soft tissue abrasion to the left knee in 1991. May 1997 treatment record reflected some right knee pain greater than left knee pain following a motor vehicle accident in January 1997. However, there were no problems with his knees before the accident. There was no documentation of left knee complaints from 1997 until 2014. The left knee complaint from 1991 was acute and resolved, with no evidence of chronicity. 

The Veteran received a VA examination in March 2022 and the examiner noted diagnoses of a left knee meniscal tear, left knee osteoarthritis, and left knee chondromalacia. The Veteran reported that he started experiencing sharp, throbbing pain in the left knee after jumping off of a Humvee while in combat. Based on the results of the examination, the examiner found that the condition was less likely than not caused by service. The December 1995 separation examination noted swollen, painful knees, but a May 1997 examination noted left knee pain following a motor vehicle accident with no prior issues. An April 2012 VA examination noted a normal left knee. Chondromalacia and arthritis were note noted until an MRI in 2020. 

Additional medical examinations and opinions were developed following the October 2022 Request for Higher-Level Review and January 2023 Higher-Level Review Return. The Veteran received a VA examination in June 2023 and the examiner noted diagnoses of left knee meniscal tear, left knee osteoarthritis, and left knee instability. The Veteran reported that his left knee pain began during service as a result of running and ruck marches; he was required to carry 75 to 150 pounds up and down a hill. He was also required to carry 100 pound rounds over gravel and on uneven surfaces. 

Based on the results of the examination, the examiner found that the knee conditions were less likely than not caused or aggravated by the service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy, right knee limitation of extension, back, left shoulder, right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, neck, right knee instability, and left lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities. These disabilities were separate entities from the left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patellae and were unrelated. A thorough review of medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship. Furthermore, the April 2012 VA examination found left knee range of motion was within normal limits and there was no objective evidence of painful motion on flexion or extension. There was evidence of left knee pain and treatment beginning in 2015, and an MRI from 2020 showed radiologic changes of the left knee. The natural progression of degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia of the patellae was the result of progressive loss and destruction of articular cartilage. As such, there was also no evidence of aggravation beyond the natural progression by the service-connected conditions. 

Finally, the examiner opined the Veteran's left knee disabilities were less likely than not caused or aggravated by service-connected disabilities through the intermediate step of obesity. The Veteran's service-connected disabilities did not preclude all forms of exercise, and obesity was most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake and lack of physical activity. Obesity was also not a substantial factor in causing the left knee disabilities, as data could not confirm that BMI caused the diseases. While obesity could increase risk, it could not be shown to have causality; genetic and involuntary environmental contribution to body weight outweighed the voluntary lifestyle choices. Finally, the examiner noted that the Veteran's left knee disabilities would have occurred as a result of other risk factors related to the development of arthritis. Obesity, while a risk factor, was not the only risk factor for the development of arthritis. 

The Board finds that the persuasive evidence is against the claim for direct service connection. While the Veteran has currently diagnosed disabilities of the knees, the probative evidence does not relate them to his service. As such, direct service connection is denied.

With regard to granting service connection on a presumptive basis, there is no evidence of record reflecting that the Veteran developed arthritis of his left knee to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from active duty. As previously noted, the Veteran was not diagnosed with left knee arthritis until 2020. Therefore, service connection cannot be granted on a presumptive basis under 38 U.S.C. § 1112. Likewise, there is no credible evidence of a continuity of symptomatology. While there is evidence of a left knee abrasion during service, the totality of the evidence reflects that it was acute and resolved without residuals. While there are subjective complaints of swollen and painful knees at separation, the evidence reflects that it linked to a motor vehicle accident while on leave and not to his time in service. Furthermore, left knee complaints did not manifest again until approximately 20 years following service. 

The Board also finds that the Veteran's claim must fail on a theory of secondary service connection, as the medical opinions took into consideration the Veteran's military medical treatment records, post-military medical treatment records and provided a rationale reconciled with the evidence of record in responding to whether the elements of secondary service connection have been met. As such, the Board affords these opinions probative weight. The persuasive evidence, therefore, is against a finding of secondary service connection for the left knee.

In reaching these conclusions, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively stands against finding in favor of the claim in that it is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim. See Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Although the rule does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise, there is still no doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). Therefore, the claim of entitlement to service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patellae, to include as secondary to service-connected disabilities, is denied.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis and chondromalacia patellae are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Assignment of a 20 percent rating for degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine, effective August 5, 2020

Grant of service connection for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy, prior to August 5, 2020

Grant of service connection for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy, prior to August 5, 2020

Grant of service connection for right knee instability, prior to August 5, 2020

The Veteran's 20 percent rating for his degenerative arthritis was granted in a September 2021 rating decision, effective August 5, 2020. The AOJ found that this date was the day VA received his intent to file a claim for compensation. A subsequent Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ, was filed within a year of that date, thus preserving the August 2020 effective date.

The claims for service connection for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and service connection for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy were also granted effective August 5, 2020 in the same rating decision. They were found to be related to the service connected back disability. When a claim of service connection is received more than one year after discharge from active duty, the effective date is the date VA receives the intent to file when a prescribed form is received within a year of the intent to file. See 38 CFR § 3.155; 38 CFR § 3.400

Finally, the AOJ granted service connection for right knee instability in in the September 2021 rating decision, effective August 5, 2020. Again, the AOJ found that this date was the day VA received his intent to file a claim for compensation.

The Board has reviewed the claims file, and the procedural documents upon which the effective dates have been assigned are not of record. Specifically, the Board is unable to locate the August 2020 intent to file. Further, there is no VA memorandum issued indicating that this procedural document is not obtainable. 

In light of the earlier effective date claims, failure to obtain a complete record was a pre-decisional duty to assist error and these issues must be remanded. 

Service Connection - Plantar Fasciitis

On his August 2020, Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran asserted that, due to excessive running and climbing during service, he injured his feet. 

A VA medical opinion was obtained in May 2023 and the examiner offered a secondary service connection opinion. However, the opinion was based on an inaccurate factual premise, as the examiner found that the claimed condition was obesity, and the service-connected condition was "thoracolumbar spine/pes planus." The examiner found that the conditions of obesity and service-connected thoracolumbar spine/pes planus were not medically related. Obesity was a separate entity entirely from the thoracolumbar spine/pes planus and unrelated to it, and a thorough review of medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship.

As the May 2023 VA examiner failed to address the contention that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis was caused and/or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, to include obesity as an intermediary step, the Board finds the May 2023 medical opinion inadequate. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise is not probative); Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2012) (per curiam) (if an opinion "is based on an inaccurate factual premise, then it is correct to discount it entirely.").

Furthermore, VA has a duty to address all arguments put forth by a claimant and/or theories under which entitlement to benefits sought may be awarded. See generally Schroeder v. West, 212 F.3d 1265 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Buckley v. West, 12 Vet. App. 76, 83 (1998) (noting that where the agency of original jurisdiction and the Board have failed to address an argument reasonably raised by a claimant in support of a claim over which the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) has jurisdiction, the CAVC will remand the claim directing the Board to address the argument).

Failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion and failure to address all theories of entitlement was a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and this claim must be remanded for a new examination.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Appropriate efforts should be made to obtain and associate with the case file the following procedural document:

(a.) August 5, 2020, Intent to File and any associated documents submitted by or on behalf of the Veteran related to his August 5, 2020 claim and/or Intent to File a Claim

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his plantar fasciitis. The claims file must be made available to the examiner, and the examiner must specify in the examination report that these records have been reviewed.

The examiner must provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis had its onset during the Veteran's active service or is otherwise due to his service. 

The examiner must also opine as to whether the Veteran's plantar fasciitis is caused or aggravated by the service-connected degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine on a theory of obesity as an intermediary step. The examiner is requested to specifically answer the following:

(a.) whether the Veteran's service-connected degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine caused the Veteran to become obese/aggravated the Veteran's obesity (to include by way of lack of movement and inability to exercise);

(b.) if so, whether the obesity/aggravation of obesity as a result of the service-connected degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine was a substantial factor in causing plantar fasciitis; and

(c.) whether plantar fasciitis would not have occurred but for the obesity caused or aggravated by the service-connected degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine.

The Board highlights that the lack of documentation in the record is an inadequate basis for a negative opinion and a medical opinion is also inadequate if it does not take into account the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history (even if recorded in the course of the examination

The examiner should consider all evidence, including lay statements, medical records, and other medical opinions of record. 

A rationale should be provided for all opinions offered.

The medical opinion must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate to consider and weigh against other evidence of record; medical opinions must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, ensure that the clinician so indicates and discusses why an opinion is not possible, to include whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.
