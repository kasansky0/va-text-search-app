FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran did not file a timely notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) within one year of notification of the September 2021 rating decision which denied service connection for right ear hearing loss, and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182.

2. The Veteran did not file a timely notice of disagreement within one year of notification of the September 2021 rating decision which granted service connection for left ear hearing loss with a 0 percent disability rating effective February 15, 2021, and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a diagnosis of chronic fatigue at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

4. Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's degenerative arthritis and lumbosacral strain did not manifest as forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for right hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.201-20.203.

2. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to a compensable disability rating for left hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.201-20.203. 

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain with spondylolisthesis (previously rated as lumbosacral strain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5239.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from July 1990 to November 1992. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of the September 2021 and April 2024 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 RO decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s] listed within the orders, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with regard to the duty to notify or duty to assist as they pertain to the issues considered in this decision. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361   (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The analysis in this decision focuses on the most relevant evidence and on what the evidence shows or does not show with respect to the issues denied in this decision. The Veteran should not assume that evidence that is not explicitly discussed in this decision has been overlooked. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (noting that the law requires only that reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant be addressed).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right hearing loss

2. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for left hearing loss 

An appeal of a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) consists of a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) submitted to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. A claimant must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). If a Notice of Disagreement is not filed within the one-year period, the decision becomes final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d)(2), 20.1103.

In the September 2021 rating decision, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss was denied. The Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss was granted, with a 0 percent disability rating, effective February 15, 2021. In the April 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran appealed his bilateral hearing loss claims, and noted he was appealing the September 2021 rating decision. The Veteran did not timely file a notice of disagreement, as the notice of disagreement was received in April 2024 which is more than a year after the September 2021 rating decision.

The Board is mindful of the recent decision in Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024), in which the Court held the one-year deadline to file a legacy NOD is not a jurisdictional bar to Board review, but a mandatory claims-processing rule. The Ferko decision dealt with the timeliness of a legacy NOD; however, the reasoning behind the Ferko ruling is applicable to the filing of an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) NOD. Therefore, the one-year deadline to file a VA Form 10182 (60 days for a contested claim) is a mandatory claims-processing rule subject to waiver by the Board.

Under Ferko and Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021), it is expected that that it could be similarly held that the time period to submit a modernized NOD (VA Form 10182) provided in current 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1) is not jurisdictional, but a claims-processing rule. See also Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428 (2011).

Importantly, the Board may apply the exception under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b), which applies to NODs and permits extensions to VA's internal deadlines for good cause. See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024). Section 3.109(b) states that a request for an extension of a time limit must be submitted concurrent with or after the untimely submission is made, and that good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was in April 2024.

Given the foregoing, the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was defective and untimely for bilateral hearing loss (service connection and increased disability for the Veteran's respective ears). As such, the appeals as listed above are dismissed as untimely on the grounds of a procedural defect. See Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 334.

SERVICE CONNECTION

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of section 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary). In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

1. Entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue 

The Veteran contends that his fatigue is related to his active military service.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of chronic fatigue and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

In October 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for chronic fatigue syndrome. The examiner indicated that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. The Veteran reported that he has daily fatigue. He is able to work but his tolerance for it has decreased. He is not receiving any treatment for his fatigue. The Veteran reported a history of diagnosed PTSD, and history of blood in his stools. The examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

As to the rationale, the October 2023 VA examiner determined that, while the Veteran experiences subjective symptoms of fatigue, the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, as he does meet the criteria outlined in the respective section in chronic fatigue DBQ.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal in the veteran's favor, the claim must be denied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In this case, the Board does not find that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, as noted above, in the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim for entitlement to service connection. Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225. Accordingly, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim for entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome, as he does not have a diagnosis.

INCREASED DISABILITY RATING

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21; see also Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings," in all claims for increased ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999).

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain with spondylolisthesis 

The Veteran seeks a higher disability rating for lumbosacral strain with spondylolisthesis. The Veteran stated that his back disability has become worse. The applicable rating period is from April 21, 2022, one year prior to the receipt of the claim, through the present. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994) (discussing the one-year "look-back" period for non-initial increased rating claims).

The Veteran's lumbosacral strain with spondylolisthesis is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic 5239.

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id.  at Note 1.  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

Summary of Relevant Evidence

August 2021 x-rays revealed "grade 2 L5 on S1 spondylolisthesis secondary to bilateral L5 spondylolysis."

In August 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his back. The examiner indicated that he has a lumbosacral strain and spondylolisthesis. The Veteran reported that his symptoms include sharp pain that radiates to right lower back, buttocks aching on a bad day, and currently 4/10. The Veteran denies any physical therapy or occupational therapy or chiropractor services. The Veteran reported he takes over the counter medications for back pain when needed. The Veteran reported that he does not have flare-ups. The Veteran reported he has functional loss or functional impairments. Specifically, he reported it hurts daily and when he travels for work, he can't sit for extended periods of time, has to pick up 34 lbs. multiple times a day daily for work. He reports he can't run at this time. He reports walking for extended periods of time and feels the back is unstable.

Upon examination, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's initial range of motion was limited to 75 degrees flexion, 25 degrees extension, 25 degrees right lateral flexion, 25 degrees left lateral flexion, 25 degrees right lateral rotation, and 25 degrees left lateral rotation. The examiner explained that passive range of motion testing was not performed because it is not feasible to do this in a safe and reasonable manner. The examiner noted that the functional loss impacts the Veteran's range of motion. There was evidence of pain during active motion that causes functional loss as noted above.

The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions without any additional functional loss or range of motion. The examiner noted that the procured evidence (statements from the Veteran) suggests that pain, weakness, and lack of endurance significantly limits the Veteran's functional ability with repeated use over time. The examiner estimated that the Veteran would be limited to 75 degrees flexion, 25 degrees extension, 25 degrees right lateral flexion, 25 degrees left lateral flexion, 25 degrees right lateral rotation, and 25 degrees left lateral rotation during repeated use over time. The Veteran reported that he does not have flare-ups. The Veteran does not have localized tenderness, guarding the muscle spasms of the thoracolumbar spine. The examiner noted additional factors contributing to the disability including interference with sitting, disturbances of locomotion, and less movement than normal. The Veteran does not have ankylosis, IVDS, or muscle atrophy. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's back disability impacts the Veteran's ability to work. Specifically, the Veteran reported he has to lift 34 lbs. daily on the job. He stated that sitting for extended periods of time and traveling times aggravates the lower back pain.

In April 2023, the Veteran was afforded an opportunity to attend an examination for his back disability. He did not report. See May 2023 exam request.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain with spondylolisthesis. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain, weakened movement, and lack of endurance during repeated use. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the Veteran's statements that he has pain when sitting for extended periods of time and when lifting heavy objects for work, and feels his back is unstable, would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees.  Additionally, the Veteran did not have muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  

Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, the Veteran does not have IVDS, and the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  

Regarding neurological impairment, the lay and medical evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has any other neurological abnormality associated with the spine disability.

The Board notes that the Veteran did not attend a VA examination in May 2023, that may have demonstrated that his back disability worsened, however there is no evidence of a good cause reason for missing the examination. Thus, the Board must make a decision based on the existing treatment records and examinations.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain with spondylolisthesis. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability including PTSD is remanded.

The Veteran contends his psychiatric disabilities are related to his active military service. The Veteran indicated that his PTSD is a serious challenge in his life.

The Veteran's service treatment records reflect that the Veteran reported depression and nervousness. See October 1992 Report of Medical History.

In the October 2023 chronic fatigue syndrome examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran reported a history of diagnosed PTSD.

The Board finds that a duty to assist error occurred prior to the April 2024 rating decision on appeal. Specifically, the Board finds that that the threshold for providing a VA examination for the claim for entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's claimed acquired psychiatric conditions were met, prior to the April 2024 rating decision on appeal, and that the issue must be remanded so that such a VA examination may be provided. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).

The Veteran is encouraged to file a supplemental claim and provide any treatment records, if any exist.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed acquired psychiatric disabilities. Provide the examiner with the Veteran's complete record, to include a copy of all remands, and the claims folder.

2. After thoroughly reviewing the Veteran's claims file including the substantive portion of this remand, the examiner must address the following:

Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's claimed psychiatric disabilities had their onset during or is otherwise etiologically related to the Veteran's active service.

The examiner must address the Veteran's service treatment records that reflect reports of depression and nervousness.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
