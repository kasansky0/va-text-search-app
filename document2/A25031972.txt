FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for left foot, left knee, right knee, and back on April 20, 2001.

4. A January 2018 rating decision granted service connection for left foot bunion, left and right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, and lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome and degenerative arthritis, effective April 17, 2017, based upon the newly received STRs.

5. The claim for service connection for left foot bunion, left and right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, and lumbosacral strain has been open and pending since April 20, 2001, the date of the original claim.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1995 to August 1999.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In that decision, the RO denied an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for left foot bunion, left and right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome and degenerative arthritis. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket (referencing April 10, 2023, which was the date of notification of the March 2023  rating decision being challenged. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective date prior to April 17, 2017, for the award of service connection for left foot bunion, left and right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome and degenerative arthritis

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(1), reconsideration of a claim is warranted at any time after VA issues a decision on the claim and receives relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim. If reconsideration is granted, then if an award is made based in any part on the newly received service department records, the effective date of the award is the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later. See Blubaugh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (describing the multi-step process in applying 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)).

The referenced "official service department records" include service records that are related to a claimed in-service event, injury, or disease, additional service records forwarded by the Department of Defense or the service department to VA, and declassified records that could not have been obtained because the records were classified when VA decided the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(1).

The RO originally denied service connection for left foot bunion, left knee, right knee, and back disabilities in a May 2002 rating decision issued in response to an April 20, 2001 claim. The May 2002 rating decision explicitly noted that STRs were not available for review. 

The Veteran submitted another claim for service connection for these disabilities in July 2002. An August 2002 letter notified the Veteran that his claim was received. The letter stated that in May 2002, the claims were previously denied, and that new and material evidence is required to reopen the claim. The letter further stated that "you do not need to obtain your service medical or personnel records or treatment reports from military or VA facilities" as it is VA's responsibility to, among other things, "develop all relevant evidence in the custody of a federal department or agency, including VA medical records..." Another VA letter dated August 2002 notified the Veteran that he had 1 year from the May 2002 rating decision to appeal it, or it would become final. 

The record shows that both of these letters, and likely the May 2002 rating decision were returned to VA due to incorrect listing of the Veteran's mailing address. 

In April 2017, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for "feet" and a low back condition. In June 2017, he filed a claim for service connection for left knee condition and right knee condition. The Veteran's STRs were associated with the file in May 2017. In a January 2018 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for left foot bunion, left and right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome and degenerative arthritis effective April 17, 2017. The grant of service connection was based in part upon the STRs associated with the claims file in May 2017.

The Board notes that 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(1) requires VA to reconsider the merits of a Veteran's claim whenever it associates relevant service department records with the claims file; the RO did not do that in this case. Furthermore, an award granted based on all or part of newly added records is entitled to become effective on the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this part applicable to the previously decided claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(3). Only if benefits are granted based on this reconsideration must VA consider an earlier effective date under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(3) and (4).

The March 2023 grants of service connection in this case fall within the ambit of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(3) because the claims were granted based in part on the additional STRs received in May 2017, which showed in-service treatment for left foot bunion, left and right knee and back. As such, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date based on the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later. Here, the evidence shows that the Veteran had experienced left foot pain as early as 1997, left knee and right knee pain as early as 1999 and back pain as early as 1996, which is prior to the previously decided April 2001 claim. Consequently, entitlement arose prior the April 20, 2001 claim and an effective date of April 20, 2001 is warranted for left foot bunion, left and right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, and lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome and degenerative arthritis.

To the extent that the Veteran did not appear for VA examinations scheduled in connection with his prior claims, it is unclear whether he was notified of the date and time of these examinations and thus any failure to appear does not preclude the application of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) as above.  In addition, the Board notes that the effective date for service connection that has been granted for the disabilities listed on the title page is the date requested by the Veteran's representative in the notice of disagreement.
