ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for upper nerve damage, right, is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for upper nerve damage, left, is dismissed. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Following the issuance of a November 2022 rating decision, the Veteran, on December 15, 2022, timely filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, seeking review of the denial of entitlement to service connection for upper nerve damage, left and right, in that November 2022 rating decision. 

2. On April 18, 2023, prior to agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) adjudication of the higher-level review request, the Veteran submitted the VA Form 10182: Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), associated with this appeal, seeking review of the same issues adjudicated in the November 2022 rating decision.

3. The submission of the April 18, 2023 VA Form 10182 prior to AOJ adjudication of the December 15, 2022 higher-level review request resulted in impermissible concurrent election of options for review of the November 2022 rating decision.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the claim for service connection for upper nerve damage, right, are met. 38 U.S.C. §?5104C(a)(2)(A); 38?C.F.R. §?3.2500(b).

2. The criteria for dismissal of the claim for service connection for upper nerve damage, left, are met. 38 U.S.C. §?5104C(a)(2)(A); 38?C.F.R. §?3.2500(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2010 to October 2011, and from February 2014 to December 2014.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following his appeal of a November 2022 rating decision.

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the November 2022 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for upper nerve damage, right is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to service connection for upper nerve damage, left is dismissed.  

In a November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for upper nerve damage, right and left. In response, the Veteran submitted a request for higher-level review on December 15, 2022, seeking review of the November 2022 denial of the same claims. On April 18, 2023, prior to AOJ adjudication of the request for higher-level review, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 seeking Board review of the same issues in the November 2022 rating decision.  

In short, the Veteran submitted a Board appeal (VA Form 10182) while an election for review of the same issues in the November 2022 rating decision via another review option (VA Form 20-0996) remained pending. There is no indication that the Veteran withdrew the request for higher-level review, and concurrent election of review options is prohibited. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  

Under the modernized (Appeals Modernization Act) system, each decision on an issue is subject to one type of review at a time. As a general matter, within one year of the date the AOJ issues a decision, a claimant may elect one of three review options: (i) a request for higher-level review by the AOJ; (ii) a supplemental claim; or (iii)?an appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1). If a request for review under one of the three available options is pending final adjudication, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different option without first withdrawing the already pending review request. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38?C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(d), (e), 20.205. 

Although multiple administrative reviews can be filed as to one AOJ decision within one year of notice of that decision, concurrent election of review options is prohibited. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a) (permitting a claimant to pursue review options in succession with respect to a specific claim or issue, but prohibiting concurrent election of multiple review options); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1) (a claimant may file a supplemental claim, request higher-level review, or appeal to the Board) 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 142-43, 145 (Jan. 18, 2019) (stating that a claimant may request "one of the three review options" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500); Terry v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?1 (2023) (holding that section 5104C(a) provides that more than one administrative review request may be filed within one year of notice of a decision so long as these administrative reviews do not run concurrently). 

In Terry, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited. The Court held that "a claimant may file more than one administrative review request within 1 year of the initial AOJ decision on a claim, as long as those administrative reviews do not run concurrently."  Id. at 14. The Court's holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple administrative review requests were "not pending concurrently," as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. §?5104C(a)(2)(A).  Id. at 2. Accordingly, the Court's holding in Terry makes it clear that only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues. 

In this case, the Veteran filed the April 18, 2023 VA Form 10182 requesting Board review of the November 2022 denial of service connection for upper nerve damage, right and left, while the December 15, 2022 request for review of the same issues (via higher-level review) was still pending. Because the first-in-time review had not yet been completed and the Veteran did not withdraw the request for higher-level review, the April 18, 2023 VA Form 10182 was a prohibited concurrent election. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry, 37?Vet. App.?1.

The Board may dismiss an appeal due to a formal defect related to mandatory claims-processing provisions, provided it "engage[s] in requisite fact finding and explain[s] the basis for dismissing the claim under the appropriate laws." Hall v. McDonough, 34?Vet. App.?329, 333 (2021). For the reasons described above, the Board is dismissing this appeal at this time. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry, 37?Vet. App.?1.
