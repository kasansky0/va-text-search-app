ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hyperlipidemia is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for esophagitis is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, claimed as intermittent explosion disorder, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Hyperlipidemia is a laboratory finding without underlying or resulting disability and is not a disability for VA compensation purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hyperlipidemia have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1981 to April 1985.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the November 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the September 2022 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

An appellant has 90 days from certification of an appeal to the Board to change representation for any reason. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304 (a). A November 2022 letter from the Board to the Veteran informed him that his case was formally placed on the Board's docket. The letter stated that he had 90 days after certification to change his representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1304 (a). On November 18, 2024, more than 90 days later, the Veteran submitted a new VA Form 21-22 Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative appointing the Pennsylvania DMVA as his new representative. However, the Board may not accept this change under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304 as there was no good cause explanation for this change in representation, which was submitted well after the 90-day period.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1304(b).  In December 2024, the Board erroneously sent a letter to the Pennsylvania DMVA informing that organization that they could submit argument in the Veteran's appeal.  No response was received.  In March 2025, the American Legion submitted an Informal Hearing Presentation (IHP).  On March 20, 2025, and following the IHP, the Board erroneously sent a letter to the Veteran to acknowledge his revocation of representation by the American Legion as of November 18, 2024.  

The Board regrets any confusion. As reflected on the title page of this decision, the American Legion will remain the recognized representative of record pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304.

Finally, the Board notes that 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 provides that a veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim. Notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing was not provided in this case prior to AOJ's initial adjudication in September 2022.  In Bowen, however, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested hearing before the AOJ because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a hearing before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253 (2012). Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket in the November 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) that he signed. The Veteran selected Direct Docket review by a Veterans Law Judge, and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, the veteran does not want a Board hearing. Because he was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation. Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.

1. Entitlement to service connection for hyperlipidemia

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran seeks service connection for hyperlipidemia.  Hyperlipidemia is "a general term for elevated concentrations of any or all of the lipids in the plasma, including hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, etc." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 792 (28th ed. 1994).

Hyperlipidemia is a laboratory finding and is not a disability in and of itself for which VA compensation benefits are payable. See 61 Fed. Reg. 20,440, 20,445 (May 7, 1996) (Diagnoses of hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, and elevated cholesterol are actually laboratory results and are not, in and of themselves, disabilities. They are, therefore, not appropriate entities for the rating schedule.)

Service connection can only be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury. See 38 U.S.C. § 1131. As detailed herein, hyperlipidemia is a laboratory finding that manifests itself only in laboratory test results and is not a disability for which service connection can be granted. As such, service connection for hyperlipidemia is not warranted.

The Board is mindful of Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (a diagnosis is not required to meet the current disability requirement and pain alone can constitute disability if it causes impairment in earning capacity). Here, the Veteran has not asserted nor provided objective evidence that pain due to hyperlipidemia has been so severe as to cause functional impairment that affects his earning capacity. Thus, the Board does not find that the Veteran's claimed symptoms rise to the level of a disability under Saunders.

In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Accordingly, service connection for hyperlipidemia is not warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for GERD is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for esophagitis is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, claimed as intermittent explosion disorder, is remanded.

The Veteran claims that his GERD, esophagitis, and psychiatric disorder diagnosed as intermittent explosion disorder are secondary to his service-connected diabetes mellitus type I with periodontal disease with bone loss, mandibular anteriors, bilateral diabetic retinopathy and cataracts with history of branch retinal occlusion, and erectile dysfunction (hereinafter diabetes).

A remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 

A VA examiner in June 2022 was asked to provide an opinion regarding whether GERD and esophagitis were proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's diabetes. In response, the examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not related to the Veteran's service-connected condition.

A VA examiner in August 2022 was asked to provide an opinion regarding whether the Veteran's psychiatric disorder was proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's diabetes. In response, the examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the Veteran's service-connected condition.

The opinions did not address whether the service-connected diabetes could have aggravated the Veteran's GERD, esophagitis, or psychiatric disorder. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013) (a medical opinion is inadequate when it fails to adequately address the question of aggravation).

The failure to obtain adequate opinions is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. Once VA undertakes the effort to obtain an opinion when developing a service connection claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide one that is adequate for purposes of the determination being made. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

Accordingly, on remand, addendum opinions must be obtained. In remanding this case, the Board makes no credibility determination, expressed or implied.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's GERD, esophagitis, and psychiatric disorder diagnosed as intermittent explosion disorder. The claims file and a copy of this remand must be made available to the examiner for review. Whether an in-person examination is needed prior to rendering the requested opinion is left to the discretion of the examiner(s).

The examiner(s) should opine as to whether the Veteran's GERD, esophagitis, and/or intermittent explosion disorder is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) caused or aggravated by his service-connected diabetes.

In answering this question, two opinions are required: one for causation and a second for aggravation. Separate opinions and separate supporting rationale are required for each prong.

The examiner is advised that 'proximate cause' is not required; it is enough if the Veteran's service-connected disability was a contributory cause. See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead holding "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection). Furthermore, 38 U.S.C. § 1131 allows for service connection of conditions that would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability.

Also, any amount of aggravation is sufficient to establish secondary service connection; permanent aggravation or worsening of a non-service-connected disability is not required. See Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233 (2019).

A complete rationale must be provided.
