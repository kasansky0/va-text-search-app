ORDER

Eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees for past due benefits awarded in the May 6, 2022, rating decision is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A total disability evaluation based on individual unemployability (TDIU) was raised by the Veteran in the February 2021 Supplemental Claim application where the Veteran asserted entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 70 percent for his acquired psychiatric disorder, including as due to unemployability.  

2. The February 2022 rating decision addressed the Supplemental Claim, which related to the previously decided evaluation of the psychiatric disorder, although it did not address the issue of the TDIU.

3. The May 6, 2022, rating decision awarding a TDIU was not the initial decision with respect to the case because TDIU was not a new claim, but a component of the claim for a higher evaluation.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees for past due benefits awarded in the May 6, 2022, rating decision have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1989 to March 1997.  The appellant, J.M.W., was the Veteran's attorney during periods pertinent to this appeal.

The fee decision on appeal (Summary of the Case) was issued in September 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. The Veteran did not elect to change the docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 fee decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405.  Any evidence submitted after the decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

This case involves a simultaneously contested claim; therefore, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 7105A are applicable. Cases involving simultaneously contested claims are also subject to special procedural regulations. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400, 20.401, 20.402, 20.403, 20.404, 20.405, 20.406, 20.407. Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 20.400 provides that, in a simultaneously contested claim, all interested parties are to be notified of the action taken by the AOJ and of the right and time limit for initiating an appeal, as well as notification of the right to a hearing and representation. Upon the filing of a notice of disagreement, all interested parties will be furnished a copy of the substance of the notice of disagreement, including what type of review was selected and whether a hearing was requested. 38 C.F.R. § 20.403.

The foregoing procedures were satisfied by letters to each party dated in September 2022, January 2025, and March 2025.

Eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees for past due benefits awarded in the May 6, 2022, rating decision.

The appellant asserts that the award of a TDIU in the May 6, 2022, rating decision should be eligible for attorney fees for the past due benefits because the issue of a TDIU was inferred and on appeal with the Veteran's other claims and was not a new claim.  

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904.

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA. The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (a). A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time. Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney. To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. A direct-pay fee agreement is a fee agreement between the claimant or appellant and an agent or attorney providing for payment of fees out of past-due benefits awarded directly to an agent or attorney. A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to pay the agent or attorney out of past-due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA. A copy of a direct pay fee agreement must be filed with the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case. This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1).

A supplemental claim filed more than a year after the initial rating decision is part of the original case, and an attorney may charge fees for representation provided in filing that supplemental claim. See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4 th 1110, 1138-41 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636 (h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).

Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be reasonable if the agent or attorney provided representation that continued through the date of the decision awarding benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (f)(1).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded based on a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3). The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran. See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Jackson v. McDonald, 635 Fed. Appx. 858 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3)(i).

Fees are not payable for an award resulting from the initial decision in an increased rating claim. See Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024).

The Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22a appointing the appellant as his representative in June 2014. At that time, the parties executed a fee agreement which states that the appellant is entitled to fees in the amount of 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded, and that fees are to be paid directly to the appellant by VA. Accordingly, the Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his attorney and the associated fee agreement are valid.

Turning to the pertinent procedural history, a June 2019 rating decision granted service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and assigned a 70 percent evaluation effective August 13, 2013.  In May 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) as to the evaluation and the effective date of the psychiatric disorder.  A July 2020 rating decision continued the 70 percent evaluation of the psychiatric disorder.

In February 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (Supplemental Claim) seeking review of the July 2020 rating decision.  The area of disagreement was the evaluation of the acquired psychiatric disorder, including individual unemployability. 

In June 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  At the same time, the Veteran resubmitted a Supplemental Claim application seeking review of the July 2020 rating decision.  The area of disagreement was the evaluation of the acquired psychiatric disorder, including individual unemployability.  The form noted "Please see attached VA form 21-8940."

A February 2022 rating decision addressed the February 2021 Supplemental Claim.  It continued the 70 percent evaluation for the psychiatric disorder.  It did not address the TDIU.

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted an HLR Request, seeking error in the February 2022 rating decision, including the failure to consider a TDIU.

A March 2022 rating decision continued the 70 percent evaluation for the psychiatric disorder.  Again, it did not decide the issue of a TDIU.

A March 2022 correspondence from VA notified the Veteran and his attorney that, regarding the February 2022 HLR Request., the issue of entitlement to a TDIU was currently pending as a claim.  Therefore, it could not be addressed in the HLR rating decision just issued.

The May 6, 2022, rating decision awarded the TDIU effective February 12, 2021.  It stated that it was in response to a "new claim for benefits that was received on February 12, 2021."

The Board finds that the appellant is eligible for the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the May 6, 2022, rating decision.  In Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) claim is part of a claim for a higher rating when such claim is raised by the record or asserted by the Veteran.  

In this case, a TDIU was raised by the Veteran in the February 2021 Supplemental Claim application where the Veteran asserted entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 70 percent for his acquired psychiatric disorder, including as due to unemployability.  The February 2022 rating decision addressed the Supplemental Claim, which related to the previously decided evaluation of the psychiatric disorder.  Because of Rice, TDIU is a component of this claim for an increased rating and is not, necessarily, a new claim.  The Board finds it is not a new claim in this situation.  Therefore, the February 2022 rating decision should be treated as a denial of the TDIU aspect of the February 2021 Supplemental Claim.  The February 2021 rating decision, therefore, can be treated as the initial decision with respect to the case.  Consequently, the May 6, 2022, rating decision is not the initial decision with respect to case, and the direct payment of fees resulting from the past-due benefits from the May 6, 2022, rating decision, are warranted.
