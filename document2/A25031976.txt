ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence during the period under review persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed mental disorder, to include PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from October 1974 to August 1976.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In October 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested review of a May 2021 decision.  In November 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the Higher-Level Review decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2021 decision.

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2021 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to Higher-Level Review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to Higher-Level Review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), i.e., a diagnosis conforming to specified diagnostic criteria; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link, or causal nexus, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).

In this case, the Veteran asserts that entitlement to service connection for PTSD is warranted, and that the claimed in-service stressor is documented in service treatment records.  See September 2022 VA Form 10182.  In a statement in support of his service connection claim for PTSD, the Veteran reported that he was assaulted and badly beaten by fellow service members.  See April 2021 VA Form 21-0781.

Turning to service records, the Veteran was recommended for discharge in August 1976 based on an apparent inability to adapt or adjust to the demands of military life.  An attachment associated with the recommendation for discharge described an incident in which the Veteran was disruptive at an event, after which "someone or several individuals dumped [the Veteran's] bunk and gave him a blanket party."  An in-service psychiatric evaluation was requested due to the Veteran's reported emotional problems.  See May 1975 Record of Individual Counseling.  The Veteran underwent a mental health evaluation in June 1975, and received the following diagnosis: immature personality manifested by inability to see that his problems are caused by his behavior; inappropriate responses and in appropriate behavior with manifestations of inadequate personality, specifically his ineptness and poor judgment.  See also August 1976 Report of Medical Examination.  The in-service mental health provider stated that the Veteran exhibited a character and behavior disorder.  However, he was found to be free from mental defect, disease, or derangement.  Prior to his separation from service, the Veteran denied depression, excessive worry, and/or nervous trouble of any sort.  See August 1976 Report of Medical History.

In connection with his April 2021 service connection claim for PTSD, the Veteran indicated that he received VA treatment from January 2017 to the present.  A review of the VA treatment records identified by the Veteran does not reflect a diagnosis of or treatment for any mental disorder, to include PTSD.  In an August 2017 VA note, the Veteran indicated that he did not need assistance with emotional issues.  The Veteran denied PTSD, depression, anxiety, and panic attacks in a later August 2017 VA note.  Despite reporting that he felt down, depressed, or hopeless for several days over the past two weeks in August 2020, depression and PTSD screenings were generally reported as negative throughout the period under review.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2021.  The examiner noted the Veteran's behavior issues in service, as well as the June 1975 mental health evaluation that yielded a finding of immature personality.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran directly experienced exposure to actual or threatened death or serious injury in service.  The Veteran reported current feelings of being easily irritated, fatigued, hypervigilant, and dysthymic.  The Veteran denied receiving psychiatric treatment with VA.  Following a review of the record (to include service records that document the Veteran's claimed in-service stressor), interview, and examination of the Veteran, the examiner stated that he did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5).  In addition, the examiner stated that the Veteran did not currently have any other diagnosed mental disorder that conforms with DSM-5 criteria.   

Insofar as the Veteran asserts that the denial of service connection for PTSD is incorrect because service records document the claimed in-service event/stressor, the November 2021 decision on appeal conceded that the Veteran experienced a stressful event in service, and that he underwent a mental health evaluation in service.  However, service connection for PTSD was denied on the grounds that the Veteran did not have a currently diagnosed mental disorder.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (pertaining to the requirement of a "current disability" for the award of service connection).  The competent medical evidence does not reflect that the Veteran has a diagnosed mental disorder at any time during the period under review.  Therefore, the appeal must be denied.
