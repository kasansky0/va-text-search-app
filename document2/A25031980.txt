ORDER

Special monthly compensation (SMC) at a rate higher than authorized by 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) + (1/2) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have blindness, deafness, or loss of use of the upper or lower extremities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for SMC at a rate higher than authorized by 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) + (1/2) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the U.S Marine Corps from December 1989 to December 1993 and in the U.S. Army from September 2008 to September 2009.  He was awarded the Combat Action Badge.  His spouse has been appointed as his fiduciary.

An initial rating decision was issued in August 2022; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  Supplemental claims were filed in September 2022 and January 2023, with corresponding rating decisions in December 2022 and March 2023, respectively.

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the March 2023 decision.  In September 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 decision.

In his November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

SMC

SMC at the (l) rate is payable if, as the result of service-connected disability, the Veteran has suffered: (1) anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet; (2) anatomical loss or loss of use of one hand and one foot; (3) blindness in both eyes with visual acuity of 5/200 or less; (4) being permanently bedridden; or (5) being so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b).

The AOJ favorably found that the Veteran needs regular aid and attendance, thus establishing entitlement to SMC at the (l) rate above.

SMC (p) bumps up the rate assigned under other provisions in half step or whole step increments.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(p); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f).  Bump-ups in excess of the (l) rate, but in no event higher than the (o) rate, are assigned for various combinations involving loss or loss of use of the feet, legs, arms, and/or hands, as well as for various combinations involving blindness and deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(1-2).  Further, additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 50 percent or more warrants the assignment of the next highest half step rate.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(3).  In no event can the rate be higher than (o), however.

Here, the Veteran's need for aid and attendance is based on his service-connected PTSD.  He also had additional disabilities independently ratable at 50 percent or more, thus establishing the half step increase from the (l) rate.  He is seeking a higher level of SMC.

SMC at the (m) rate is payable if, as the result of service-connected disability, the Veteran has suffered: (1) anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands; (2) anatomical loss or loss of use of both legs at a level, or with complications, preventing natural knee action with prosthesis in place; (3) anatomical loss or loss of use of one arm and of one leg at a level, or with complications, preventing natural elbow and knee action with prosthesis in place; (4) blindness in both eyes having only light perception; or (5) blindness in both eyes which results in being so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(m); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(c).

SMC at the (n) rate is payable if, as the result of service-connected disability, the Veteran has suffered: (1) anatomical loss or loss of use of both arms at a level, or with complications, preventing natural elbow action with prosthesis in place; (2) anatomical loss of both legs so near the hip as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance; (3) anatomical loss of one arm and one leg so near the shoulder and hip as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance; or (4) anatomical loss of both eyes or blindness without light perception in both eyes.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(n); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(d).

SMC at the (o) rate is payable if, as the result of service-connected disability, the Veteran has suffered: (1) anatomical loss of both arms so near the shoulder as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance; (2) when two or more of the rates (l) through (n) are warranted, with no disability being considered twice; (3) bilateral deafness rated at 60 percent or more (when the hearing impairment in either one or both ears is service-connected) in combination with service-connected blindness with bilateral visual acuity 20/200 or less; or (4) service-connected total deafness in one ear or bilateral deafness rated at 40 percent or more (when the hearing impairment in either one or both ears is service-connected) in combination with service-connected blindness of both eyes having only light perception or less.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(o); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e)(1).

Through the combination of loss of use of both legs and helplessness, paralysis of both lower extremities together with loss of anal and bladder sphincter control merits payment of SMC at the maximum (o) rate.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e)(2).  Payment of SMC at the maximum (o) rate is also merited for loss of use of two extremities combined with helplessness, to include from absolute deafness and nearly total blindness and from very severe multiple injuries producing total disability outside of useless extremities.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e)(4).  Determinations must be based upon separate and distinct disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e)(3).

SMC at the (r) rate concerns special aid and attendance.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(r); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(h).  It is an additional allowance available when not hospitalized at government expense.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(h).  To qualify under the (r)(1) or the (r)(2) rate, receipt of the (o) rate, the maximum rate under (p), or an intermediate rate between the (n) and (o) rates plus a (k) rate is required.  The need for regular aid and attendance is also required to qualify under the (r)(1) and (r)(2) rates.  SMC (r)(2) applies when, because of a service-connected disability, the Veteran needs in-home personal health-care services provided by either 1) a person who is licensed to provide such services, or 2) a person who provides such services under the regular supervision of a licensed health-care professional.

The Board finds that SMC at any rate higher than the currently assigned by 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) + (1/2), is not warranted because the Veteran does not have any service-connected blindness, deafness, or loss of use of any extremity.  He is not service-connected for any hearing loss or eye/vision disabilities.  Regarding the extremities, he is not service-connected for any upper extremity disability.  He is service-connected for a left knee strain and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  However, these do not result in loss of use.

Loss of use exists when no effective function remains other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation stump at the site of election below the elbow or knee with the use of a suitable prosthetic appliance.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a)(2)(i).  The regulation also provides that the determination as to whether such loss of use exists will be made based on the actual remaining function, whether the acts of grasping, manipulation, etc., in the case of the hand, or the acts of balance, propulsion, etc., in the case of a foot, could be accomplished equally well by an amputation stump with prosthesis.  Id.  Examples include complete paralysis of the external popliteal nerve with consequent foot drop accompanied by characteristic organic changes such as trophic and circulatory disturbances and other concomitants confirmatory of complete paralysis of this nerve.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a)(2)(i)(b).

Private treatment records from February 2022 show the Veteran had left knee range of motion from 0 degrees extension to 130 degrees of flexion and normal stability.  In a May 2022 statement, the Veteran's wife acknowledged that he could walk up to 100 feet without a brace and drive for short distances.  An August 2022 disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) completed by his private physician noted that the Veteran had an unstable gait due to his left knee, and that it prevented prolonged standing and walking.  Bending and squatting were also difficult.  In a February 2023 statement, the Veteran's physician stated that radiculopathy and left knee pain prevented the Veteran from carrying more than 10 pounds and could not engage in prolonged standing, lifting, or ending.  He also regularly wore a knee brace and needed a cane to walk more than 100 feet. 

Collectively, this evidence shows some limitations associated with the Veteran's lower extremity disabilities, but that he did not have any "loss of use" as defined above.  While the Veteran could not engage in prolonged walking, it is undisputed that he is able to walk, including walking short distances without any use of a brace or other ambulatory aid.  SMC (m) requires loss of use of both legs at a level, or with complications, preventing natural knee action with prosthesis in place, which has not been shown.  The Veteran's physician acknowledged that activities like squatting were difficult, but not impossible, indicating a level of function far greater than that contemplated by loss of use.

Regarding the specific assertion of entitlement to SMC (r), the Board acknowledges that the Veteran, through statements from his wife and treating physician, requires in-home personal health care services.  However, this is not the sole criterion for SMC (r).  As noted above, to qualify under the (r)(1) or the (r)(2) rate, receipt of the (o) rate, the maximum rate under (p), or an intermediate rate between the (n) and (o) rates plus a (k) rate is required.  Because the Veteran does is not in receipt of these rates, SMC (r) cannot be considered.
