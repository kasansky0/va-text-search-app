ORDER

Eligibility for attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a December2023 rating decision is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a January 2021 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), inter alia, granted service connection adjustment disorder with anxiety (psychiatric conditions); a 10 percent rating was assigned effective October 29, 2020.

2. In March 2023, the Veteran and the appellant executed and submitted a valid VA Form 21-22a and a valid Fee Agreement.

3. In April 2023, a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, was submitted, seeking, inter alia, review of the rating assigned for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric conditions.  Such submission also requested of the time to file such review request, citing the COVID-19 pandemic for good cause.

4. In May 2023, a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, was submitted, seeking a total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU), along with a VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.

5. In a July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ, inter alia, denied an increased rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric conditions; entitlement to a TDIU was not addressed.

6. In August 2023, a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, was submitted, seeking, inter alia, review of the July 2023 rating decision's denial of a higher rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric conditions.

7. In a December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ increased the rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric conditions from 10 percent to 70 percent, effective May 4, 2023.  The AOJ also granted entitlement to a TDIU, effective May 4, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the December 2023 rating decision have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 Fee Decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office.

In a December 2023 VA Form 10182, the appellant requested review of the December 2023 Fee Decision under the Board's direct review docket.  Under direct review, a Board decision is based on the evidence at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a hearing or accept additional evidence into the record in its direct review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Accordingly, the Board may only consider evidence of record as of December 13, 2023, the date of the decision on appeal.

Procedural Requirements

As an initial matter, the Board notes that a claim for attorney fees constitutes a contested claim and, therefore, is subject to special procedural requirements.  See Mason v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 1 (2012).

Specifically, under applicable criteria, upon the filing of a notice of disagreement (NOD) in a contested claim, all interested parties are to be furnished a copy of the substance of the NOD, including the type of review requested.  38 C.F.R. § 20.403.  Thereafter, the non-appealing party has 30 days within which to file a brief, argument, or request a different type of review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.404.

Here, in a January 2024 correspondence, the Veteran was notified that the appellant had submitted a VA Form 10182 regarding entitlement to attorney fees, that the appellant had requested review under the Board's direct review docket, and notified the Veteran of the 30-day window within which to file a brief, argument, or request a different type of review.  The Veteran was also provided a redacted copy of the December 2023 VA Form 10182.  See January 2024 Board Correspondence.

Therefore, the Board finds that the procedural requirements with regards to contested claims have been met, and the Board may proceed with adjudication of this appeal.

Analysis

Eligibility for attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a December 2023 rating decision is granted.

The appellant seeks attorney fees for representation provided in conjunction with a December 2023 rating decision's award of an increased rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric condition and award of a TDIU.  Specifically, the appellant contends that such awards were the result of an April 2023 supplemental claim.  See December 2023 VA Form 10182.  In other words, the appellant contends that the December 2023 rating decision was the result of a valid appeal.

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.  To represent a claimant before VA, a representative must execute a power of attorney, on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative."

Agents or attorneys may charge claimants fees for representation once: (a) the agent or attorney has complied with regulatory power of attorney (POA) and fee agreement requirements; and (b) an AOJ has issued notice of an initial decision on a claim.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.631, 14.636.

In other words, agents or attorneys are eligible for the payment of fees, based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded in a decision, only if there is a valid POA and Fee Agreement AND the decision which awarded the past-due benefits was the result of a valid appeal.  Notably, when such a decision is issued in response to a supplemental claim, the payment of fees is warranted so long as the supplemental claim is seeking the same or similar benefits on the same or similar basis as the original claim.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Vet. Aff., 7 F4th 1110, 1138 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Here, the appellant complied with the regulatory POA and fee agreement requirements.  Specifically, the appellant and the Veteran executed a valid VA Form 21-22a in March 2023.  See March 2023 VA Form 21-22a.  Additionally, a Fee Agreement was also executed and filed in March 2023, providing for direct payment of 20 percent of past-due amounts.  See March 2023 Fee Agreement.

As the first element to establish eligibility for attorney fees has been met, the remaining question is whether the AOJ had issued an initial decision on the claim.  In other words, this matter turns on whether the issue of entitlement to a higher rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric conditions and entitlement to a TDIU were on appeal at the time of the December 2023 rating decision.

Here, the December 2023 VA rating decision states that it was issued in response to a new claim for benefits received in April 2024.  Additionally, the record shows that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU had not been adjudicated by the AOJ prior to the December 2023 rating decision.

However, as noted above, in a January 2021 rating decision, service connection was granted for the Veteran's psychiatric conditions and a 10 percent rating was assigned.  In April 2023, a supplemental claim was submitted seeking, inter alia, review of the rating assigned for such; a request for an extension of time to file the review request, identifying the COVID-19 pandemic as good cause, accompanying such supplemental claim.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995.

In a July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 10 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric conditions.  Though the AOJ did not address the request for an extension of the time in which to file an appeal of the January 2021 rating decision, such request was implicitly granted by the AOJ's readjudication of the rating assigned therein.  

Thereafter, in August 2023, a Higher-Level Review request was submitted seeking, inter alia, review of the July 2023 rating decision's denial of a higher rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric conditions.  See August 2023 VA Form 20-0996.  The December 2023 rating decision, which awarded a rating of 70 percent for the Veteran's psychiatric conditions, was issued while the higher-level review request was pending.  

Given the above, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a higher initial rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric conditions was on appeal at the time of the December 2023 rating decision.

With respect to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, the Board notes that, when evidence of unemployability is submitted during the course of an appeal of an assigned disability rating, a claim for entitlement to a TDIU will be considered to have been raised by the record as "part and parcel" of the underlying claim.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-454 (2009).

Here, as discussed above, the Veteran appealed the initial rating assigned for his service-connected psychiatric conditions.  While such appeal was pending, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940 in which he asserted that his service-connected conditions precluded employment.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-8940.

Given the above, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU was raised during the course of the appeal as to the ratings assigned for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric conditions and, therefore, was part and parcel of such appeal.  

However, though TDIU was raised by the record as part of the appeal of the ratings assigned for the Veteran's service-connected back conditions and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, the July 2023 HLR decision did not address the issue of entitlement to a TDIU.  As such, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU remained on appeal and, therefore, was on appeal at the time of the March 2024 rating decision.

In short, as both entitlement to a higher initial rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric conditions and entitlement to a TDIU were on appeal at the time of the December 2023 rating decision, the attorney fees specified in the Fee Agreement are warranted.  Therefore, the appeal is granted.
