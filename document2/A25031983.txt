ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has not suffered from a bilateral hearing loss disability, as defined for VA compensation purposes, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 2000 to September 2006 to include four years of sea service. The Veteran had additional service in the United States Naval Reserve. 

In November 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-0966 Intent to File. In December 2021, the Veteran submitted her initial claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss. A January 2022, Rating Decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss. The RO found that the Veteran did not have hearing loss for VA purposes. In December 2022, the Veteran filed a request for Higher-Level-Review (HLR) of the previous denial. In February 2023, the Veteran took part in a HLR Informal Conference and argued that her hearing was worsening and that private audio examinations warrant service connection. In February 2023, the RO HLR rating decision declined to grant service connection for bilateral hearing loss. The RO again determined that the Veteran did not meet the requirements for bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes. In March 2023, the Veteran appealed that decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) via a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)). The Veteran requested the Direct Review docket. 

As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, direct review by the Board without submission of additional evidence and without a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the decision on the issue on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence has been submitted during a window of time when the Board may not consider it in reaching this decision. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, additional medical records. If the Veteran wishes for this evidence to be considered, he may do so by filing a supplemental claim. Instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), service connection may be granted for disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. Such permits a grant of service connection not only for disability caused by a service-connected disability, but for the degree of disability resulting from aggravation to a nonservice-connected disability by a service-connected disability. Id. See also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b). 

In order to prevail on the issue of entitlement to secondary service connection, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss

In December 2021, the Veteran submitted a statement regarding her contention that her time in service caused her claimed bilateral hearing loss. The Veteran's statement noted that she was constantly exposed to hazardous equipment noise due to her job duties. The Veteran noted she was part of a flight deck team consisting of the chock crew which involved setting chocks up to the helicopter's tires when landing on the ship's flight deck. The Veteran complained of daily exposure to outside heavy machinery such as forklifts, pneumatic needle guns, pneumatic sanders, sea ship-to-ship replenishment, ship's defensive weapon's testing, firearms qualifications, and other heavy machinery. 

As noted earlier in this decision, the first element of service connection is evidence of a current disability. For bilateral hearing loss, there is a specific definition to have hearing loss for VA purposes. 

A veteran will be found to have hearing loss for VA purposes when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Both the January 2022 and February 2023 rating decisions found that the Veteran did not have bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes. 

In November 2000, the Veteran was provided information on the hearing conservation program. The Veteran was advised of the dangers of hazardous noise exposure and signed acknowledging receipt of one pair of ear plugs.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) contain numerous audiograms. None of these audiograms contain findings sufficient to warrant a finding of hearing loss for VA purposes. In December 1999, there was no auditory threshold of 26 decibels or greater. This same finding is true of audiograms completed in August 2000, two from September 2001, October 2002, November 2003, August 2004, January 2005, February 2005, and September 2005. None of these audiograms contain even one single finding above 25 decibels. There is no word recognition scores associated with any of these audiograms. 

In December 2005, the Veteran's STRs include her acknowledging that she used protective equipment including ear plugs. 

In December 2021, following her exit from service, the Veteran was seen with complaints of bilateral hearing loss. The Veteran reported loud noise exposure from aircraft, heavy machinery, and firearms while in service. At the time of the visit, the Veteran was found to have borderline/mild conductive hearing loss in the middle frequencies in both ears. The physician noted an unsure cause of the Veteran's underlying conductive hearing loss but that it may be related to mild osteosclerosis.

In December 2021, the Veteran submitted a private audiogram. The Veteran referenced this audiogram in her February 2023 informal conference mentioned above. The audiometric results were as follows: 

 	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg. Hz.	WRS

RIGHT	15	25	No reading	20	Not possible	100

LEFT	25	25	20	20	23	100

None of these readings result in a finding of bilateral hearing loss for VA rating purposes. None of the readings were 40 decibels or greater and there were not three frequencies showing 26 decibels or greater. This examination also included word recognition scores, noted in the above chart, but did not indicate if this was the Maryland CNC word list. Regardless of which word list was used, a 100 percent speech recognition score does not result in a finding of hearing loss for VA purposes. 

In January 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The Veteran noted a drop in her hearing. She again pointed to exposure to heavy machinery, aircraft, pneumatic tools, weapons qualifications. The Veteran did note that hearing protection was consistently worn. The Veteran denied any post-service noise exposure. Audiometric results were as follows: 

 	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg. Hz.	CNC%

RIGHT	10	15	20	15	15	96

LEFT	10	15	15	10	13	96

The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with normal hearing bilaterally. Despite having normal hearing, the examiner still provided an opinion that any hearing loss was not related to service. The examiner also noted that there was no significant threshold shift from enlistment to separation. These outcomes do not result in a finding of hearing loss for VA purposes. 

Neither the numerous audiograms in service, the private audiogram, or the January 2022 VA examination show that the Veteran is suffering from bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes. None of these audiograms show auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz as 40 decibels or greater; or auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. As the first element of service connection has not been met the claim is denied. 

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. "When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other." Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In this case, the evidence persuasively favors a finding that the Veteran has hearing loss for VA purposes. Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not change the outcome on this issue.
