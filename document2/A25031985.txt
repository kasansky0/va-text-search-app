ORDER

Readjudication of the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is warranted.

Readjudication of the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, variously diagnosed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder, is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to an acquired psychiatric disorder, is remanded. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a May 2017 rating decision, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), in pertinent part, denied service connection for PTSD, major depression, and sleep apnea.

2. In October 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) with respect to his claims for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and sleep apnea.

3. Evidence that was not part of the actual record before the RO at the time of the May 2017 decision tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the Veteran's claims.

4. The Veteran suffers from a current acquired psychiatric disorder, variously diagnosed as PTSD and major depressive disorder, that has been medically attributed to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. New and relevant evidence has been received as to the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501.

2. New and relevant evidence has been received as to the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501.

3. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for an award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, variously diagnosed as PTSD and major depressive disorder, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from July 1982 to July 1985, and from June 1986 to June 1990. His decorations include the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2021 rating decision issued by a VARO. The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in April 2021, selecting the hearing review option. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(2).

In November 2024, the Veteran and his son testified at a Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge. A transcript of that hearing has been associated with the record. Under the hearing review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). The Board cannot consider (1) evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and before the hearing was held, or (2) evidence submitted more than 90 days after the hearing was held. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

That said, for the reasons set forth below, the Board is remanding the Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep apnea to the AOJ. The AOJ will consider any additional evidence that has been submitted when that claim is readjudicated. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

As a final introductory matter, the Board notes that the Veteran indicated on his April 2021 VA Form 10182 that he wished to appeal the issue of his entitlement to service connection for hearing loss. However, the AOJ had not yet adjudicated that issue at that time. As such, that issue is not properly before the Board in the present appeal stream. 

1. Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to warrant readjudication of the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.?

2. Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to warrant readjudication of the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.

The Veteran filed his original claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and sleep apnea in April 2016. The AOJ denied the claim in a May 2017 rating decision. 

In order to readjudicate a claim which has been previously considered, a claimant must present new and relevant evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim. Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

The evidentiary record for a supplemental claim includes all evidence received by VA before VA issues notice of a decision on the supplemental claim. For VA to readjudicate the claim, the evidentiary record must include new and relevant evidence that was not of record as of the date of notice of the prior decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(b).

The May 2017 rating decision denied service connection for PTSD because VA was not able to corroborate an in-service stressor and because the evidence did not otherwise show that PTSD was related to service. Because PTSD was not shown to be service connected, the AOJ also denied service connection for major depression and sleep apnea as secondary to PTSD. It was further noted that there was no evidence showing that major depression or sleep apnea was otherwise incurred in or aggravated by service. The evidence before VA at the time of that rating decision consisted, in part, of the Veteran's service treatment records and statements from the Veteran regarding traumatic events he reported having experienced in service.

Since the time of the May 2017 rating decision, the Veteran has submitted additional information with respect to traumatic events he experienced in service, as well as copies of VA examination reports dated in August 2021, July 2024, and October 2024 wherein multiple examiners collectively confirmed diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder and attributed those disorders to service. The Veteran also submitted medical literature addressing the relationship between PTSD and sleep apnea.

This evidence is new, inasmuch as it was not before VA at the time of the May 2017 rating decision. It is also relevant inasmuch as it tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue (i.e., that an acquired psychiatric disorder is related to service, and that sleep apnea might be related to the acquired psychiatric disorder). Because new and relevant evidence has been received, readjudication of the previously denied claims is warranted.

3. Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, variously diagnosed as PTSD and major depressive disorder, is granted.

The Veteran seeks to establish service connection for acquired psychiatric disorders, most recently diagnosed as PTSD and major depressive disorder. He contends that the disorders are directly related to service; most significantly, as due to military sexual trauma (MST).

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).

38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5) contains special provisions pertaining to PTSD claims based on in-service personal assault, including that evidence from sources other than a claimant's service records may corroborate the account of the stressor. Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy. Id. Evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources. Id.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has observed that 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5) specifically provides that a medical opinion may be used to corroborate a personal assault stressor, noting "medical opinion evidence may be submitted for use in determining whether the occurrence of a stressor is corroborated." See Menegassi v. Shinseki, 683 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (observing that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims erred when it determined that a medical opinion based on a post-service examination of a Veteran could not be used to establish the occurrence of a stressor); see also Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 280 (1999) (rejecting the requirement that "something more than medical nexus evidence is required for 'credible supporting evidence'" in personal assault cases).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. An approximate balance of the evidence includes, but is not limited to, equipoise. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In the present case, there is no dispute that the Veteran has a current acquired psychiatric disorder. A July 2024 VA PTSD disability benefits questionnaire, for example, reflects that he has been diagnosed with PTSD and major depressive disorder. As such, the first element of service connection, as to the presence of a current disability, has been satisfied.

The Veteran's service treatment records contain no direct reference to complaints of, treatment for, or diagnoses of an acquired psychiatric disorder. He asserts, however, that he was sexually assaulted during service and that it took years for him to summon the courage to speak about what had happened to him in service. 

As to the question of nexus, or link, between the diagnosed disabilities and service, as noted above, the record contains VA examination reports dated in August 2021, July 2024, and October 2024 wherein multiple examiners collectively confirmed diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder and attributed those disorders to service. The August 2021 and October 2024 examiners concluded that that the evidence was at least as likely as not consistent with the occurrence of MST, and the July 2024 and October 2024 examiners concluded that the major depressive disorder was secondary to the PTSD. Inasmuch as the examiners' opinions were based on an accurate understanding of the facts, and articulated reasons for the conclusions reached, the Board finds the opinions probative. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

In view of the foregoing, the Board is satisfied that the requirements for an award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder have been met. The evidence, at a minimum, gives rise to a reasonable doubt on the matter. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The appeal of this issue is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to an acquired psychiatric disorder, is remanded.

The AOJ found, in part, that because service connection had not been established for an acquired psychiatric disorder, service connection for sleep apnea could not be granted as secondary thereto. As such, the AOJ did reach the merits of the issue of whether the claimed sleep apnea was, in fact, secondary to an acquired psychiatric disability. To avoid any prejudice to the Veteran, a remand for AOJ consideration of the merits of the matter, in the first instance, is warranted. See Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394, 399 (2010); Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 393-94 (1993).

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

After undertaking any development deemed necessary, readjudicate the merits of the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to his service-connected acquired psychiatric disorders.
