ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's hearing loss is etiologically related to his active service.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to his active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1971 to January 1972.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2020 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

On May 19, 2020, the VA received a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) to the March 2020 rating decision in which the Veteran selected the Evidence submission docket.  Consequently, the Board may consider evidence submitted through the March 16, 2020, notification of the March 2020 rating decision in this case, and evidence received within 90 days of the May 19, 2020, notice of disagreement.  The Board will not consider evidence added to the record between the March 16, 2020, rating decision notification and May 19, 2020, notice of disagreement, nor that evidence added following the expiration of 90 days from the May 19, 2020, notice of disagreement.  If evidence was added to the record during an ineligible period identified above, the Board has not considered that evidence.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.

In a January 2024 Board decision, the Board denied the issue of entitlement to service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus.  The Veteran appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In September 2024, the parties agreed to a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR).  The JMR formally requested that the Court vacate the Board's January 2024 denials and remand the matters to the Board for corrective measures.  In September 2024, the Court granted the JMR.  

The parties to the January 2024 JMR agreed that the Board erred by failing to remand under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 for correction of an error by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty.  Despite the right to a hearing prior to the AOJ issuing a decision on the Veteran's claims for hearing loss and tinnitus, he was not provided with notice of his right to a pre-decisional hearing before the RO issued the March 13, 2020, rating decision.

The case is now again before the Board for further appellate action. As the Board is herein granting the claims in full, the Veteran will not suffer any prejudice by the Board's willingness to proceed without any further action pursuant to the September 2024 JMR.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Certain chronic diseases, including sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, will be presumed related to service if they were noted as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if continuity of the same symptomatology has existed since service, with no intervening cause.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a).

The benefit of the doubt rule provides that a veteran will prevail in a case where the positive evidence is in a relative balance with the negative evidence.  Therefore, the Veteran prevails in a claim when: (1) the weight of the evidence supports the claim, or (2) when the evidence is in equipoise. It is only when the weight of the evidence is against the claim that the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

1. Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is granted.

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral hearing loss related to in-service noise exposure.  

As an initial matter, in the March 2020 rating decision, the RO rendered as a favorable finding that the Veteran had a military occupational specialty associated with a moderate probability for hearing loss.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

For VA purposes, a minimum degree of hearing loss is a prerequisite for entitlement to service connection.  McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15 (2016).  Hearing loss is a disability for VA purposes if the auditory threshold for any of the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The threshold for normal hearing is between 0 and 20 decibels and higher thresholds show some degree of hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993). 

The Veteran's DD Form 214 indicates he served in the Army as a motor transport operator.  A list of his decorations report that he earned the marksmanship badge with rifle bar.  In January 1972, the Veteran was released to the Missouri Army National Guard.  The Veteran's enlistment contract shows that he enlisted in the Army National Guard for a period of six years, beginning on July 23, 1971.

A May 1971 pre-induction medical examination included an audiological evaluation that revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, for the right ear at 25 (500 Hz), 0 (1000 Hz), 0 (2000 Hz), not tested (3000 Hz), and 25 (4000 Hz), and for the left ear at 10 (500 Hz), 10 (1000 Hz), 10 (2000 Hz), not tested (3000 Hz), and 30 (4000 Hz).

A December 1971 separation medical examination included an audiological evaluation that revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, for the right ear at 5 (500 Hz), 10 (1000 Hz), 5 (2000 Hz), not tested (3000 Hz), and 10 (4000 Hz), and for the left ear at 10 (500 Hz), 5 (1000 Hz), 10 (2000 Hz), not tested (3000 Hz), and 10 (4000 Hz).

The Veteran was afforded a VA audiology examination in March 2020.  A VA authorized audiological evaluation revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, for the right ear at 25 (500Hz), 35 (1000 Hz), 55 (2000 Hz), 70 (3000 Hz), and 70 (4000 Hz), and for the left ear at 65 (500 Hz), 65 (1000 Hz), 70 (2000 Hz), 75 (3000 Hz), 75 (4000 Hz).  Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 98 percent in the right ear and 32 percent in the left ear.  The audiologist diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in the frequency range of 500 to 4000 Hz.  

The examiner reported that the Veteran's military occupational specialty was a motor transport operator, which had a moderate probability for hazardous noise exposure.  The examiner reported pre-military noise exposure as farming equipment.  Military noise exposure was reported as grenades, truck/transport vehicles, helicopters, power tools, heavy equipment, generators, jack hammers, and gunfire.  Post-military noise exposure was reported as farm equipment, weed eaters, and lawn mowers.  

The examiner opined that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss and left ear hearing loss were less likely as not caused by or a result of an event in military service.  For both right ear and left ear hearing loss, the examiner provided the following rationale: "Hearing thresholds from entrance audiogram to exit audiogram was normal for both VA and clinical purposes and a significant shift was not observed at any test frequency."

In May 2020, the Veteran submitted a statement in which he attested that he was not given a hearing test upon his exit from the service.  He stated that "[w]e were all rushed out because people were out processing from Vietnam and we were being rushed through and told if there was anything wrong we would have to stay and of course no one wanted to have to stay for any reason."  According to the Veteran, they were all "rubber stamped" out of the service.  The Veteran stated the ringing in his ears did not start until he was in the military and has continued to the present.  He expressed that he had stated that previously to the examiner but "it was obviously ignored or not recorded in the transcripts."

The Board notes that in the March 2020 rating decision the RO conceded that the Veteran has a current hearing loss disability for VA purposes.  The RO also found that the Veteran's military occupational specialty had a moderate probability for hearing loss.  These are prior favorable findings the Board will not disturb. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c); 20.801(a).  Therefore, the Veteran has met the first and second element of direct service connection.  This appeal primarily hinges on the third element of direct service connection, namely a causal relationship, or nexus, between the Veteran's current disability and the in-service event, injury, or disease. 

According to the Veteran's DD Form 214, he served in the Army as a motor transport operator and was awarded the marksmanship badge with rifle bar.  The March 2020 examiner noted that motor transport operator had a moderate probability for hazardous noise exposure.  The Veteran reported exposure to loud noises, such as grenades, truck/transport vehicles, helicopters, power tools, heavy equipment, generators, jack hammers, and gunfire.  This noise exposure is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, as shown by the Veteran's service record and lay evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  

The absence of in-service evidence of a hearing disability during military service (i.e., one meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385) is not always fatal to a service connection claim.  Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  Evidence of a current hearing loss disability and a medically sound basis for attributing that disability to service may serve as a basis for a grant of service connection for hearing loss where there is credible evidence of acoustic trauma due to significant noise exposure in service, post-service audiometric findings meeting the regulatory requirements for a hearing loss disability for VA purposes, and a medically sound basis upon which to attribute the post-service findings to the injury in service (as opposed to intercurrent causes).  See Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 159.

After carefully reviewing and weighing the competent medical evidence of record, the Board is satisfied that it is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to his period of active service.  The unfavorable evidence consists of a negative May 2020 nexus opinion based on hearing thresholds that were normal for VA purposes at the Veteran's military audiogram.

However, the record also contains favorable evidence, primarily the Veteran's likely exposure to some degree of acoustic trauma during service, as is confirmed by his military duties and reported exposures to loud noises during his military service.  In May 2020, the Veteran stated the ringing in his ears began in the military and has continued to the present.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the supporting evidence places the cause of his current hearing loss in relative equipoise.  Thus, the Board finds that it is not possible to determine to what extent the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss may be attributed to noise exposure in service versus some other etiology.  

In this case, any doubt that remains as to whether at least some of his bilateral hearing loss is attributable to service, as opposed to some other cause, is resolved in favor of the Veteran and service connection for hearing loss is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran contends that he has tinnitus that is related to in-service noise exposure, including exposure to grenades, truck/transport vehicles, helicopters, power tools, heavy equipment, generators, jack hammers, and gunfire, during his active service duties as a motor transport operator.

As an initial matter, in the March 2020 rating decision, the RO rendered as a favorable finding that the Veteran had a military occupational specialty associated with a moderate probability for hearing loss.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

The Court has specifically held that tinnitus is a type of disorder associated with symptoms capable of lay observation.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  As such, the primary role of the Board in adjudicating a tinnitus claim is to assess the credibility of the Veteran's statements.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

The Veteran was afforded a VA audiology examination in March 2020.  The Veteran reported having constant tinnitus.  The examiner reported the Veteran does not know when the tinnitus started and does not know what caused its onset.  

The examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) caused by or a result of military noise exposure.  As rationale, the examiner stated the Veteran's hearing was normal at entrance and separation from the military.  The Veteran is not able to link the start of tinnitus or the cause of tinnitus, only that it is present.

In May 2020, the Veteran submitted a statement in which he attested that he was not given a hearing test upon his exit from the service.  He stated that "[w]e were all rushed out because people were out processing from Vietnam and we were being rushed through and told if there was anything wrong we would have to stay and of course no one wanted to have to stay for any reason."  According to the Veteran, they were all "rubber stamped" out of the service.  The Veteran stated the ringing in his ears did not start until he was in the military and has continued to the present.  He expressed that he had stated that previously to the examiner but "it was obviously ignored or not recorded in the transcripts."

According to the Veteran's DD Form 214, he served in the Army as a motor transport operator and was awarded the marksmanship badge with rifle bar.  The March 2020 examiner noted that motor transport operator had a moderate probability for hazardous noise exposure.  The Veteran reported exposure to loud noises, such as grenades, truck/transport vehicles, helicopters, power tools, heavy equipment, generators, jack hammers, and gunfire.  This noise exposure is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, as shown by the Veteran's service record and lay evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  

As the Veteran's statements about in-service noise exposure are consistent with the circumstances of his service and because the Veteran is competent to relate a history of noise exposure during service, there is no reason to doubt the credibility of his statements regarding military noise exposure.  The Veteran indicated in his May 2020 statement that the ringing in his ears started during his military service and has continued to the present.  Therefore, the Board finds it credible that the Veteran had experienced some degree of tinnitus in service that had become worse over the years.

Taking all reports into account, the Board concludes that the evidence is in relative equipoise, meaning that the evidence for and against the Veteran's claim is essentially equal.  In such circumstances, the regulations dictate that reasonable doubt is to be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  Accordingly, as the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is for application, the Board finds that the grant of service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
