ORDER

Service connection for hearing loss is granted.

?

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hearing loss is related to service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1986 to January 1990.

The case is on appeal from a June 2021 rating decision.

In the August 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.

A Board hearing was held in March 25 2025.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

At the hearing, the Veteran waived the 90-day post-hearing window.

Service connection for hearing loss. 

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  A veteran seeking compensation under these provisions must establish three elements: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1395 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that if the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, which includes but is not limited to equipoise, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt).

Analysis

The Veteran asserts that he has hearing loss that is related noise exposure from aircraft engines and equipment as associated with his duties as a tactical aircraft maintenance mechanic.  

The Board notes the current disability requirement for the claim is met.  The June 2021 rating decision includes as a favorable finding that the Veteran is diagnosed with a current disability, as a May 2021 VA examination report reflects that Veteran has been diagnosed with hearing impairment for VA purposes pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

In addition, the second requirement, i.e., the occurrence of qualifying event, injury, or disease is also met.  The June 2021 rating decision also identified as a favorable finding that the Veteran's DD Form 2014 indicates that the Veteran specialty of tactical aircraft maintenance specialist is associated with duties with a high probability of hazardous noise exposure.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Thus, the remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current hearing loss and service.  Concerning this question there is evidence that weighs against and in favor of the claim.  Weighing against the claim is the opinion of the examiner who provided a VA examination in May 2021.  The examiner concluded it is less likely than not that the Veteran's hearing loss was caused by or the result of military service.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's hearing was normal when he separated from service over 30 years ago and his current hearing loss is more likely due to age.  

Weighing in favor of the claim is an opinion from a privat audiologist submitted by the Veteran in March 2025.  The private audiologist concluded it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's hearing loss is due to or the result of in-service noise exposure.  She considered the Veteran's lay statements concerning the details of his in-service noise exposure; that this noise exposure has been conceded; and that he reported that the onset of tinnitus occurred during service.  The private audiologist cited to current medical literature which supports that noise induced hearing loss can have a delayed onset after noise exposure.  She noted that research studies demonstrate there is a significant time delay in primary neural degeneration throughout the cochlea, which suggests that noise-induced damage to the ear has progressive consequences that are considerably more widespread than are revealed by conventional threshold testing; and animals exposed to loud noises at a young age exhibited accelerated-age related hearing loss later, despite recovering their hearing initially.  She also cited to a new body of research which suggests that noise exposure during military service can accelerate the subsequent progression of hearing loss.  

The Board finds the Veteran's hearing loss is related to service, when reasonable doubt is resolved in his favor.  In comparing the relative strengths of the May 2021 VA opinion and the March 2025 private opinion, the Board finds the March 2025 private more persuasive.  In this regard, findings and opinion from the private audiologist are clear and unequivocal and are based on the relevant information, including the Veteran's statements, STRs, and post-service medical records.  In addition, the private audiologist's explanations are logical and follow from the facts and information given.  See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 105-06 (2012); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  

The Board affords less probative weight to the May 2021 VA opinion as the examiner offered very little rationale to support the conclusion.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's hearing loss was more likely due to age rather than noise exposure during service, based solely on in-service audiological testing at separation.  Thus, the examiner did not consider current medical literature discussed by the private audiologist which supports that hearing damage may occur despite the absence of evidence of such exhibited by threshold testing.  

In conclusion, when resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the Veteran's hearing loss is related to service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Accordingly, service connection for hearing loss is warranted.
