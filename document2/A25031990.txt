ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.  

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have bilateral hearing loss as defined by VA regulation. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1986 to April 1989, from February 1991 to July 1991, from October 2001 to September 2002, February 2003 to February 2004, and in April 2004.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the April 2024 VA Form 10182 also appealed the issues of entitlement to service connection for disabilities related to the Veteran's right and left hands and right and left knees.  However, the Veteran switched AMA dockets to a Hearing docket by submitting an August 2024 VA Form 10182.  VA notified the Veteran of this in an April 2025 correspondence.  As such, the issues of entitlement to service connection for disabilities related to the Veteran's right and left hands and right and left knees will be adjudicated in a separate Board decision.

Pursuant to the Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA), VA has duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.  

The Veteran asserts that his in-service noise exposure caused hearing loss.

Service connection for impaired hearing shall only be established when hearing status as determined by audiometric testing meets specified pure tone and speech recognition criteria.  Audiometric testing measures pure tone threshold hearing levels (in decibels) over a range of frequencies (in Hertz).  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).

Impaired hearing is defined as a disability under VA law when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels (dB) or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels; higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).

In an October 2023 claim, the Veteran reported having hearing loss due to working around aircraft for over 20 years.

In a November 2023 VA audiological examination, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	20 	20	10	20	25

LEFT	20	20	15	25	25

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear and of 94 percent in the left ear.  The examiner found no functional impact due to hearing loss.  

Post-service VA treatment records do not show complaints of, treatment for, or a diagnosis of hearing loss.  In June 2023, the Veteran reported ongoing tinnitus, for which he is already service connected. 

Based on a careful review of the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not currently have bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes and has not had bilateral hearing loss at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

According to the audiograms of record, to include the November 2023 VA audiogram, the Veteran's hearing loss did not result in auditory thresholds of 40 decibels or greater in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz or auditory thresholds of 26 decibels or greater for at least three of the frequencies 500,1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz in either ear.  Further, his speech recognition scores were 96 percent in the right ear and 94 percent in the left ear.  

While the Veteran is competent to report hearing difficulties, he is not competent to diagnose hearing loss, including by VA standards or otherwise.  Such a diagnosis requires specialized knowledge of audiograms and an ability to interpret all pertinent responses.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  As the evidence does not include a competent diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met.

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes, as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Where there is no evidence of a current disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding in favor of the Veteran's service connection claim.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
