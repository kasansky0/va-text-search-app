DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The reduction of the Veteran's disability rating for service-connected bilateral hearing loss from 10 to 0 percent effective May 2, 2023, was improper, and a 10 percent rating is restored as of that date.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was in receipt of a 10 percent rating for service-connected bilateral hearing loss disability from November 2018 to May 2023, a period of less than five years.

2. At the time of the reduction, there was reasonable doubt as to whether there was improvement in the Veteran's service-connected hearing loss disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The reduction of the rating for service-connected bilateral hearing loss from 10 percent to 0 percent was improper, and the criteria for restoration of the 10 percent rating are met, effective May 2, 2023.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.344, 4.1, 4.2, 4.10, 4.13, 4.85.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March 1971 to December 1974.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

The reduction of the Veteran's disability rating for service-connected bilateral hearing loss from 10 to 0 percent effective May 2, 2023, was improper, and a 10 percent rating is restored as of that date.  

By way of background, the AOJ awarded entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability in a March 2019 rating decision.  The AOJ assigned an initial 10 percent rating, effective November 20, 2018.  

Within one year of filing a January 2023 intent to file, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his hearing loss disability in March 2023.  He appeared for a May 2, 2023 audiological evaluation.  Based on the examination results, the AOJ sent the Veteran a September 2023 rating decision and notice letter proposing to reducing his hearing loss disability rating from 10 to 0 percent.  In the notice, the AOJ informed the Veteran he had 60 days to submit additional evidence in support of a higher rating. The AOJ also notified the Veteran the opportunity to appear for a pre-determination hearing with the AOJ.  

The Veteran did not respond to the AOJ's notice letter, and in the above-referenced December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ effectuated the reduction from 10 to 0 percent, effective May 2, 2023.  The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182 in May 2024, requesting Board review of the propriety of the reduction.

For reductions in ratings to be properly accomplished, specific requirements must be met.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.344; see also Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277 (1992).

Here, the AOJ complied with the notice requirements outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) for reduction proposals.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have argued to the contrary, and the Board otherwise observes no failure to properly notify of the reduction.   

With regard to disability ratings in effect for a period of 5 years or more, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a) and (b) are for application. Where a veteran's schedular rating has been both stable and continuous for 5 years or more, the rating may be reduced only if the examination on which the reduction is based is at least as full and complete as that used to establish the higher evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a). Ratings for disease subject to temporary or episodic improvement will not be reduced on the basis of any one examination, except in those instances where the evidence of record clearly warrants the conclusion that sustained improvement has been demonstrated. Id. 

With respect to disabilities that are likely to improve (i.e., those in effect for less than 5 years), as in this case, reexaminations disclosing improvement in disabilities will warrant a rating reduction. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).

Notably, VA is required in any rating-reduction case "to ascertain, based upon review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based upon thorough examinations." Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 421 (1993); see also Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991) ("[t]hese requirements for evaluation of the complete medical history of the claimant's condition operate to protect claimants against adverse decisions based on a single, incomplete[,] or inaccurate report and to enable VA to make a more precise evaluation of the level of disability and of any changes in the condition").

Furthermore, 38 C.F.R. § 4.10 provides that "[t]he basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body, to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment," and 38 C.F.R. § 4.2 directs that "[e]ach disability must be considered from the point of view of the veteran working or seeking work." "Thus, in any rating-reduction case not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred but also that that improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work." Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 421; see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.10.

In a rating reduction case, VA has the burden of establishing that the disability has improved.  See Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282, 286 (1991).  After review of the evidence of record, and for the reasons discussed below, the Board finds reasonable doubt as to whether there was improvement in the Veteran's service-connected hearing loss disability warranting reduction.

Prior to May 2, 2023, a January 2019 examiner indicated that, due to hearing loss,  the Veteran had to ask people to repeat themselves, and that he had to raise the volume of the television.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's hearing loss manifested in decreased speech understanding in both quiet and noisy environments.  VA treatment reports note that the Veteran did not like to wear hearing aids, and that either he or VA had previously declined hearing aids.  See a December 21, 2021 VA reports of medical care.

Although the May 2, 2023 examination documented hearing test results showing better hearing acuities and speech discrimination scores on that day, the report does not contain enough information to demonstrate that the Veteran had experienced actual improvement in his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work as of that date.  Indeed, the Veteran reported continued inability to hear others-having to ask others to repeat themselves. He reported that his wife says he cannot hear.  The examiner identified sensorineural hearing loss in both ears at frequencies between 500-4000 Hz, as well as in frequency ranges of 6000 Hz or higher, and the examiner characterized the Veteran's tinnitus (which is also service-connected) as a symptom of his hearing loss.

In its December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ reduced the Veteran's disability rating looking exclusively to the numerical audiometric test results within the May 2023 examination report. However, the AOJ did not articulate any actual finding regarding improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  

Based on the above, and after review of all the evidence of record prior to the December 2023 rating decision, the Board finds that the May 2023 audiological examination report was, at best, incomplete, insofar as it did not adequately discuss whether actual improvement in function.  Given the substantially similar reports of impairment at both the 2019 and 2023 audiological examinations, reasonable doubt remains as to whether actual improvement in the Veteran's disability occurred, warranting a reduction in rating.  As such, the reduction was improper, and the 10  percent disability rating for left ear hearing loss is restored, effective May 2, 2023.
