ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as secondary to service-connected chronic low back pain associated with right ankle injury (back pain and ankle injury), is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The most probative evidence of record indicates the Veteran's diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been caused or aggravated beyond its normal course of progress by his service-connected chronic low back pain associated with right ankle injury (back pain and ankle injury).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ), as secondary to service-connected chronic low back pain associated with right ankle injury (back pain and ankle injury), have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from November 1986 to December 1988. 

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. §?3.2400(a)(1). The AMA applies to all initial decisions issued after February 19, 2019. 

The present matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision issued by VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Accordingly, this decision is subject to the AMA.? 

In the July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection on a secondary basis for the Veteran's OSA.

Next, the Veteran timely appealed the July 2023 decision to the Board in a July 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. Based on the Veteran's selection of the direct review docket, the Board may only consider evidence on record at the time of the July 2023 rating decision on appeal. 

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). The absence of any one element will result in a denial of service connection.????? 

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held that "[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional." Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("[T]he Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence").?? 

Service connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).?? 

Service connection may alternatively be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  

Service connection may alternatively be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Secondary service connection may also be established for a disorder which is aggravated by a service-connected disability; compensation may be provided for the degree of disability (but only that degree) over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. See 38?C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?374 (1995).?? 

In order to prevail on the issue of secondary service connection, the record must show: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11?Vet. App.?509, 512 (1998); see also Allen, supra.?? 

Additionally, service connection may be granted on a secondary basis when the evidence establishes (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. See Wallin v. West, 11?Vet. App.?509, 512 (1998); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. 

The Board observes that obesity is not considered a disease or disability for VA purposes and is not subject to service connection. See Marcelino v. Shulkin, 29?Vet. App.?155, 156 (2018). However, obesity may be an intermediate step between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service-connected on a secondary basis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see also Walsh v. Wilkie, 32?Vet. App.?300 (2020). Further, the Court has held that the proper interpretation of establishing obesity as an intermediate step requires consideration of both proximate causation and aggravation. Walsh v. Wilkie, 32?Vet. App.?300, 306-7 (2020). Thus, for secondary service connection to be granted under this theory, the record must demonstrate (1) whether a service-connected disability (or service-connected disabilities combined) caused or aggravated (i.e., worsened) the Veteran's obesity; (2) if so, whether the obesity or aggravation of obesity as a result of service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing the claimed current disability; and (3) whether the claimed disability would not have occurred but for obesity caused or aggravated by the service-connected disability. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32?Vet. App.?300, 307 (2020). 

Service connection must be considered on the basis of the places, types, and circumstances of a Veteran's service as shown by his or her service records, the official history of each organization in which he or she served, his or her medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); and see Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).????? 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §?3.102.?? 

1. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ), as secondary to service-connected chronic low back pain associated with right ankle injury (back pain and ankle injury)

The Veteran maintains that his OSA was caused by his service-connected back pain and ankle injury. Specifically, the Veteran maintains that he became obese due to inactivity resulting from his service-connected disabilities. The Board agrees and finds that the elements of service connection on a secondary basis have been satisfied.

With respect to current disability, the AOJ rendered a favorable finding in the July 2023 rating decision that the Veteran has a current disability of OSA, and the Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104(b)(4), 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). Accordingly, the first element of service connection, a current disability, is satisfied. Additionally, the Veteran is service connected for back pain and ankle injury disabilities, so this aspect of secondary service connection is also satisfied. 

The remaining question is whether the Veteran's OSA was either caused by or aggravated by his service-connected back pain and ankle injury disabilities. The record contains positive and negative medical opinions addressing this question.

In June 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination that only consisted of a records review. After the review, the examiner offered a positive nexus opinion stating that the Veteran's OSA was as least as likely as not proximately due to or the result of his service-connected conditions. As rationale, the examiner considered the Veteran's report that he gained 55 pounds due to inactivity and his back pain and ankle injury. The examiner noted that obesity/weight gain is the number one risk factor of developing OSA and studies further show a relationship between chronic pain and chronic sleep impairment. Additionally, the Veteran reported difficulty sleeping on his side due to his chronic pain and taking both OTC and prescription medications. In addressing the medications, the examiner stated they cause fluid retention which results in narrowing of the upper airway predisposing to OSA and studies show it exacerbates OSA. In conclusion, the examiner opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's service-connected back pain and ankle injury caused the Veteran's obesity which caused the OSA. The opinion is thorough and is supported by clear rationale. This opinion also concurs with and cites to the rationale contained in the March 2023 Private OSA examination, which provided a positive nexus. As such, the Board finds this opinion highly probative. 

In July 2023, the same VA examiner from the June 2023 VA examination offered a negative addendum nexus opinion regarding obesity as an intermediate step between OSA and the Veteran's service-connected back pain and ankle injury disabilities. The AOJ requested clarification from the prior June 2023 opinion regarding a November 2021 medical record from the Memphis TN VAMC, where it was noted that obesity was due to excessive caloric intake and caloric intake is a risk factor for obesity, and for the examiner to further discuss whether the service-connected conditions caused the inactivity or whether it was the Veteran choosing not to exercise except for his duties from work. The AOJ asked the examiner to explain why the Veteran has been able to engage in physical activity required for his multiple jobs, managing multiple farms, owning a trucking company and driving a truck on a regular basis but why the Veteran has not been able to sustain physical activity sufficient to avoid obesity. 

In response to the AOJ's additional query, the examiner explained that obesity is a complex issue with many causes and proceeded to state that it is caused when extra calories are stored in the body as fat, and excessive caloric intake is a risk factor for obesity. The examiner acknowledged the November 2021 Memphis TN VAMC medical record, as if for the first time since it was already listed in the evidence considered in the earlier opinion he authored. Then, the examiner backtracked on his previous opinion. The examiner opined that since the Veteran is able to engage in physical activity required for his occupation, his activity is not affected by his service-connected conditions, and, subsequently, it is less likely than not that the Veteran's obesity is due to his service-connected conditions. However, this evidence regarding the Veteran's work was also previously available in the record, and the examiner did not take issue with it in forming his earlier opinion. Furthermore, the examiner did not reverse his position regarding how the medications the Veteran takes for his service-connected conditions contributes to his OSA, creating an inconsistency with the first opinion which was not reconciled. 

Thus, the Board does not find the July 2023 addendum opinion adequate. In the rationale, the examiner failed to clearly explain why he did not find the record evidence in question dispositive in the earlier opinion but found it dispositive in the addendum opinion. The addendum opinion also does not explain why the examiner is now discounting the Veteran's lay statements when they were apparently credible previously, and the addendum does not address the conflicting, March 2023 private nexus opinion's findings. Moreover, the examiner did not follow up to ask the Veteran to explain how he can work despite his disabilities and to what degree. Therefore, the Board finds that the examiner has engaged in some speculation with respect to Veteran's job duties and how his service-connected disabilities impact his ability to perform his work. For the aforementioned reasons, the Board finds the July 2023 VA addendum inadequate, and affords it no probative weight. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Additionally, the Board has considered and finds the March 2023 private medical opinion highly probative. The private doctor concluded that the Veteran's weight gain and obesity is due to and/or related to his service-connected back pain and ankle injury disabilities and that it is at least as likely as not that without the Veteran's weight gain and obesity his OSA would not have occurred. As rationale, the private doctor considered all pertinent medical and lay evidence and provided medical studies and literature in support of the conclusion. The Board finds this opinion adequate and affords it high probative weight.  

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record as to a nexus are the June 2023 VA opinion and the March 2023 private medical opinion both linking the Veteran's obesity to his service-connected back pain and ankle injury disabilities, thus  demonstrating that his obesity was a substantial factor in the development of his OSA, and that the OSA would not have occurred but for his obesity. As a result, the criteria for service connection for OSA secondary to the service-connected disabilities have been met and entitlement to service connection for OSA is granted.
