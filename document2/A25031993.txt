REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right hip condition, to include degenerative changes, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from October 1993 to September 1997.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested review of an April 2024 rating decision that included denial of service connection for right hip strain.  The July 2024 higher level review rating decision only considered the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 rating decision. 

In an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected Direct Review.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 rating decision, which was later subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  However, as the Board is remanding the issue of entitlement to service connection for a right hip condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in the adjudication of this claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  

The Board notes the Veteran has the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Although the period to change dockets per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not elapsed, as notification of the July 2024 rating decision was mailed on July 23, 2024, since the issue is being remanded for further development due to a duty to assist error, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding to adjudicate the appeal. 

Entitlement to service connection for a right hip condition is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he developed a right hip condition due to and "somehow aggravated" by years of right knee issues including instability, an uneven gait, and leg length discrepancy caused by surgery to replace his right knee.  See November 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, November 2023 VA Form 21-10210, August 2024 VA Form 10182.  The Veteran specifically contends the extra weight he gained by being unable to exercise since 1996 aggravated his right hip problems, and he noticed pain in his right hip shortly after his right knee replacement surgery in September 2022.  See November 2023 VA Form 21-10210, April 2024 VA Form 21-4138, July 2024 Higher Level Review Informal Conference Worksheet, August 2024 VA Form 21-4138. 

Although obesity is not a disability for VA compensation purposes, it can constitute an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and another current disability that may be service-connected on a secondary basis. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 302 (2020).  VAOPGCPREC 1-2017, explains this requires competent and credible evidence that: (1) the service-connected disability caused or aggravated the Veteran's obesity; (2) obesity was a substantial factor in causing the claimed disability; and (3) the claimed disability would not have occurred but for the obesity caused by the service-connected disability. 

The April 2024 rating decision included favorable findings of the Veteran's service-connected right knee disability and right knee total arthoplasty and current right hip strain diagnosis.  In a separate decision, the Board found that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities caused or aggravated his obesity.  

The Veteran's service treatment records show a report of a May 1994 injury to his left knee; June 1995 emergency treatment for a fall down a flight of stairs; August and September 1996 reports of right knee instability, pain, and that he was "heavily favoring [his] right leg" and had an antalgic gait; reports of increased right knee pain in January 1997; and a May 1997 Medical Board examination that noted the Veteran's history of right knee injury, left knee pain "probably because he was favoring the right", and that he had a limping gait.  See May 1994 to January 1997 Health Records, May 1997 Medical Board Report.  

The Veteran's VA and private treatment records from March 2000 through March 2024 show continued reports of worsening right knee pain prior to and after successive surgeries, to include his September 2022 total right knee replacement; antalgic gait; continued need for a right knee brace; and left knee pain.  See March 2000 to March 2024 VA Treatment Records, April 2000 to July 2009 University Health Services Records, December 2017 to September 2022 Drs. J.R., M.F. Treatment Notes, August 2018 to March 2020 Dr. M.Z. Treatment Notes.  The Veteran reported "problems" with his left knee and right hip in July 2012 from compensating for his knee. In January 2020, he was seen for chronic, continuous, dull throbbing right knee and right hip pain.  See January 2020 VA PACT Note.  In September 2023, the Veteran requested an orthopedic consult for his right hip, and VA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed degenerative changes in both hips.  See September 2023 VA Imaging Report. 

Under the AMA framework, the Board may remand where there has been a duty to assist error prior to issuance of a rating decision.  While the Board regrets the additional delay, remand is required to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the April 2024 rating decision.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The VA has the duty to make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in securing evidence necessary to substantiate their claim for VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  The duty to assist includes a duty to obtain all relevant records.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  

During the January 2024 VA hip and thigh examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran needed a left heel lift to keep both legs the same height, and referenced imaging from the Veteran's private treating orthopedist that the examiner noted was not visible within the file.  November 2022 VA community care coordination plans show that the Veteran was approved to see private orthopedists Drs. M.F., and J.R.  However, while there are some private treatment records in the file from these providers from July 2017 through December 2017, and July to September 2022, there are also references to Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) scanned images from these providers in January 2023, October 2023, and February 2024 VA community care consult notes that are not visible in the file.  In April 2024, the Veteran reported a recent visit to his private primary care provider to treat his lower back spasms and pulled muscles; however, these records are also not visible in the file.  Therefore, remand is required to obtain these identified private treatment records and associate them with the Veteran's file.  

The duty to assist also extends to obtaining an adequate VA examination.  Once VA has provided a VA examination, it is required to provide an adequate one, regardless of whether it was legally obligated to provide an examination in the first place.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

During the January 2024 VA hip and thigh examination, the Veteran reported that his right hip pain and lower back pain began in March 2020, and worsened after his September 2022 right knee total replacement surgery.  The Veteran reported that he uses a heel lift to keep his legs the same height.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's hip imaging was unremarkable and showed no degenerative changes, and diagnosed the Veteran with a right hip strain.  However, a September 2023 VA MRI showed degenerative changes in the Veteran's hips, which was not addressed by the examiner.  In a corresponding opinion, the examiner acknowledged that the Veteran had reported right hip pain and knee pain in July 2012 and January 2020, at which time his obesity and right knee pain were discussed, but based the negative secondary nexus opinion on the lack of treatment, diagnosis or "method of injury" or evidence of any compensation injury for the right hip.  However, a lack of evidence cannot be corroborating to conclude that there is no relationship between the Veteran's current disability and his military service.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007).  Medical evidence is considered probative when it is factually accurate, fully articulated, and provides sound reasoning for the conclusion.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  An examination with a medical opinion adequately informing the Board of the Veteran's disability while considering prior medical history requires thorough consideration of the Veteran's lay reports of symptomatology.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 257 (2020).  Notably, the examination report and corresponding opinion did not address the September 2023 VA imaging showing degenerative changes in the Veteran's hips, his history of an antalgic gait since service, the notation in the July 2012 VA treatment record where the Veteran reported "problems" with his right hip from compensating for his knee, or whether the Veteran's obesity aggravated his right hip condition.  Therefore, the Board finds that the January 2024 opinion was based on an incomplete review of the record, disregarded the Veteran's reports of symptoms, and did not adequately address aggravation.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993); see also El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 138 (2013) (an opinion regarding secondary service connection is inadequate if it does not address both causation and aggravation).  Therefore, the Board finds remand is warranted for an adequate opinion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain and associate with the claims file copies of the Veteran's private treatment records from Drs. M.F. and J.R., the Veteran's treating orthopedists, to include imaging referenced during the January 2024 VA hip and thigh examination and VistA scanned images referenced in January 2023, October 2023, and February 2024 VA community care consult notes, and ensure these documents are visible in the file.  Also attempt to obtain the private treatment records from the Veteran's April 2024 report of a recent visit to his private primary care provider to treat his lower back spasms and pulled muscles.  Ensure these records, if available, are viewable within the claims file.

If any indicated records are unavailable, it must be documented in the record. The Veteran must be notified of unsuccessful efforts and allowed an opportunity to obtain and submit those records for VA review.

2. Obtain an opinion by a different clinician, on the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right hip condition, to include degenerative changes.  A complete copy of the claims file, to include this Remand, must be made available to and reviewed by the clinician.  An examination is not required unless deemed necessary by the clinician.

The clinician must opine:

a.) whether it is at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) that the Veteran's right hip condition(s) had its onset in or is otherwise related to active service, to include an in-service fall and a noticeable limping gait due to compensation? Please explain why or why not.

b.) whether it is at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) that the Veteran's right hip condition(s) was caused OR aggravated by a service-connected disability, to include the antalgic gait and instability that existed prior to and continued after his successive right knee surgeries? Please explain why or why not.

c.) whether the Veteran's weight gain and obesity was a substantial factor in causing OR aggravating his right hip condition, to include degenerative changes; and if so,

whether the Veteran's right hip condition(s) would not have occurred or been aggravated but for the obesity found to have been caused or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities.

Specific emphasis is placed on service treatment records showing left knee injury in May 1994; a June 1995 emergency report of injury after a fall down a flight of stairs; August and September 1996 reports of right knee instability, pain, and an antalgic gait and observed "heavily favoring right leg"; January 1997 report of increased right knee pain; May 1997 Medical Board Report of right knee injury, left knee pain "probably because he was favoring the right" and a limping gait; July 2013 "problems" with his left knee and right hip "from compensating for the knee"; January 2020 report of chronic continuous left knee and right hip pain; September 2023 request for an orthopedic consult for his right hip; and a September 2023 VA MRI showing degenerative changes in his hips.  

The clinician is advised that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology and the chronic nature of his symptoms, and such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion.  If the clinician finds any medical reason to reject the lay reports, then the reviewing clinician must provide an explanation for such rejection.  

The clinician is reminded that a lack of evidence cannot be corroborating to conclude that there is no relationship between the Veteran's current disability and his military service.

The clinician must provide a complete rationale for any opinion expressed.  If the clinician is unable to reach an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she should explain the reasons for this inability and comment on whether any further tests, evidence or information would be useful in rendering an opinion.
