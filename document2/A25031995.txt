Eligibility to attorney fees, based on past-due benefits awarded in a January 2024 rating decision, is granted.

?

FINDING OF FACT

An earlier June 2022 rating decision is the initial decision with respect to the case for the evaluation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with an intertwined issue of a total disability due to individual unemployability (TDIU), and allows charging of fees.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to attorney fees, based on the past-due benefits from the January 2024 rating decision, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2005 to February 2008.

The appellant is the Veteran's attorney representative.

The case is on appeal from a February 2024 decision.

The appellant timely filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) to the February 2024 fee decision and elected the Direct Review docket.  In April 2024, the Veteran was provided a copy of the appellant's NOD pursuant to contested claims procedures, and has not filed a response.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403-4.  

Therefore, the claim remains on the Direct Review docket, and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405.  In this case, no additional evidence, only argument, has been received since the February 2024 decision.

Attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a January 2024 rating decision.

Legal Criteria

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904. 

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA.  The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney, and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1). 

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits.  A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).

Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f).  When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2). 

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1); Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024); Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28 (2023).

Analysis

In December 2021, the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22a appointing the appellant as his representative.  The parties also executed a fee agreement at that time, which provided that the appellant was entitled to 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran.

In June 2022, the Veteran was granted service connection for PTSD with a 70 percent evaluation.  Within one year of the June 2022 rating decision, the Veteran filed two VA 21-0966 Intent to File forms.  He then filed in August 2023 a VA 21-8940 Application for a TDIU, listing his PTSD, bilateral knees, tinnitus, right hand, IBS, and allergic rhinitis as service-connected conditions that prevent substantially gainful occupation.

In January 2024, the Veteran was granted a TDIU effective September 2, 2022, the date the Veteran last worked.  The rating decision specifically stated that the TDIU was based on his PTSD condition.

In the February 2024 fee decision letter, the parties were advised that although there was a valid direct-pay fee agreement for the appellant, the award did not warrant direct payment of fees because VA never received a qualifying request to review a decision on the issue granted.  The appellant timely filed a NOD in February 2024 to the fee decision, and in April 2024, the Veteran was provided a complete copy of the appellant's NOD pursuant to contested claims procedures.

The Board finds that the appellant is eligible to attorney fees from the past-due benefits awarded in the January 2024 rating decision, as the June 2022 rating decision was the initial AOJ decision with respect to the case, allowing for the appellant to charge fees.

First, the record reflects that the appellant complied with the power of attorney requirements, and that the fee agreement is valid.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.627, 14.631, 14.636.  

Second, the fee provisions for decisions issued on or after the effective date for AMA appeals are applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1) states that a fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  

In the case of Jackson, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) addressed what is considered the "initial decision" pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  37 Vet. App. at 277.  Particularly, the Court found a new request for an increased rating is a new claim that results in a subsequent initial decision on that claim, even if filed on a supplemental claim form under the AMA system.  Id. at 291.  This is distinguished from the filing of a supplemental claim in continuous pursuit of a prior, non-final rating decision evaluation.  Id. at 295.

Further, in the recent case of Chisholm v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (Mar. 13, 2025), a VA Form 21-8940 Application for a TDIU may be considered a supplemental claim where the facts of the case warrant.

Here, the June 2022 rating decision was the initial decision on the evaluation assigned for the Veteran's PTSD.  That decision was continuously pursued as evidenced by the August 2023 VA Form 21-8940 Application for a TDIU, listing PTSD as a disability preventing substantially gainful employment, and serves as a supplemental claim in an attempt to get a higher rating for PTSD.  Thus, the appellant was allowed to charge fees after the June 2022 rating decision surrounding the issue of an increased rating for PTSD, and the intertwined issue of a TDIU.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).

The Board notes that the VA Form 21-8940 TDIU Application was filed more than one year after the June 2022 rating decision.  However, the filing of two Intent to File forms in October 2022 and November 2022 serve as placeholders in this instance when considering whether the claim has been continuously pursued.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1145-47 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (allowing supplemental claims in the intent-to-file framework).

In sum, the Board finds that the June 2022 rating decision is the initial decision with respect to the case on the issue of the evaluation assigned for PTSD, with the intertwined issue of a TDIU, and the appellant was allowed to charge fees.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  As the grant was a result of continuous pursuit of an increased rating, the appellant is eligible for attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the January 2024 rating decision.
