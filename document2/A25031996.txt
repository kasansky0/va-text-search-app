REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for service connection for hypertension on basis other than the PACT Act presumption is remanded.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for service connection for HHD, to include as secondary to hypertension on basis other than the PACT Act presumption, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The PACT Act added hypertension to the list of diseases presumptively associated with exposure to herbicide agents, became effective on August 10, 2022; the earliest possible effective date for a grant of service connection pursuant to the PACT Act is August 10, 2022. 

2. The October 2023 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for HHD as secondary to hypertension with the effective date of August 10, 2022; and he effective date of award of service connection for HHD granted on a secondary basis can be no earlier than the date of the award of service connection for hypertension, the primary disability.

3. Prior to October 6, 2022, the Veteran's BLE tibial nerve does not more closely approximate severe incomplete paralysis. 

4. From October 6, 2022, the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity BLE PN is manifested by moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, but do not more nearly manifest moderately severe incomplete paralysis, or severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension pursuant to the PACT Act have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.114, 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to August 10,2022, for a grant of service connection for HHD, as secondary to hypertension, pursuant to the PACT Act, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

3. Prior to October 6, 2022, the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for RLE posterior tibial nerve have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.123, 4.124, 4.124A, Diagnostic Code 8525.

4. Prior to October 6, 2022, the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for RLE posterior tibial nerve have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.123, 4.124, 4.124A, Diagnostic Code 8525.

5. From October 6, 2022, the criteria for a rating of 20 percent, and not higher during the appeal period for RLE PN have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

6. From October 6, 2022, the criteria for a rating of 20 percent, and not higher during the appeal period for LLE PN have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1969 to March 1970. He had additional service in the Army Reserves from March 1970 to August 1973. The Veteran has a combined rating of a 100 percent since February 18, 2015 (which occurred outside the appeal period under review discussed herein). See Rating Decision - Codesheet (April 2024). He is also in receipt of total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) benefits from February 10, 2024. 

The rating decision on appeal as to entitlement to effective dates prior to August 10, 2022, for the awards of service connection for hypertension and HHD was issued in October 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The AMA automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). The rating decision on appeal as to entitlement to ratings in excess of 10 percent for RLE PN and in excess of LLE PN was issues in October 2024; therefore, the AMA applies here as well.

In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2021 decision. In December 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2021 decision.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of his claims for increased rating for BLE PN most recently addressed in a December 2022 rating decision.  In April 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, and requested review of a December 2023 rating decision that awarded service connection for hypertension and HHD, effective August 10, 2022, and an April 2024 supplemental claim decision that continued the 10 percent rating for RLE PN and a 10 percent rating for LL PN. In February 2025, the AOJ issued the HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior decisions. 

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Accompanying his February 2025 VA Form 10182, the Veteran, via his attorney, submitted a waiver of his option to select a different review option. See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (February 2025). See also, 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); Williams v. McDonough, No. 21-7363 (U.S. Vet. App. June 21, 2024). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decisions on appeal (October 2023 for earlier effective date claims for hypertension and HHD, and April 2024 for increased rating claims for BLE PN), which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension pursuant to the PACT Act, and for increased rating claims for BLE PN, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension on the basis other than the PACT Act, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c). 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b).

Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim or a claim for an increased evaluation shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim was "a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). An informal claim is "[a]ny communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits." 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). VA must look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as applications or claims - formal and informal - for benefits and is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits. Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992). The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are: (1) an intent to apply for benefits; (2) an identification of the benefits sought; and (3) a communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the plain language of the regulations requires a claimant to have intent to file a claim for VA benefits).

For claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015). Claims or appeals pending before VA on that date are to be decided based on the regulations as they existed prior to the amendment. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686.

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term date entitlement arose is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a facts found basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the RO receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

Additionally, under the AMA, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in paragraph (c) of this section within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). Continuously pursuing a claim occurs where, after notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim, the Veteran files a supplemental claim, requests a higher-level review, or appeals to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, or after notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the Veteran files a supplemental claim or appeals to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

When compensation is awarded pursuant to a liberalizing law, the effective date may be as early as the effective date of the law, if the claim is received within one year of the effective date of the law. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

The PACT Act was enacted, effective August 10, 2022. For claims pending on or before the enactment of the PACT Act, the earliest possible effective date for a grant of service connection pursuant to the PACT Act is August 10, 2022. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

The effective date of awards of claims granted on a secondary basis can be no earlier than the date of the claim for compensation on a secondary basis. Ellington v. Nicholson, 22 Vet. App. 141, 145 (2007) (finding that the effective date for a grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II and hypertension as secondary to leukemia was the date of the claim for secondary service connection, not the date of claim of service connection for leukemia), aff'd sub nom. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364. The effective date cannot be earlier than that of the underlying disability because entitlement to secondary service connection does not arise until the underlying disability is service connected. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.310, 3.400. In other words, service connection for a disability on a secondary basis arises from an underlying disability that is already service connected; therefore, "the date entitlement arose" for a secondarily service connected disability cannot be prior to the underling service connected disability's effective date. Id.; see DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 35 (2000).

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension under the PACT Act.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for HHD, to include as secondary to hypertension under the PACT Act.

The October 2023 rating decision assigned August 10, 2022, as the effective date for the grant of service connection for hypertension, the date that the PACT Act was signed into law. Specifically, the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents during his service in Vietnam, and service connection for hypertension was granted on that basis. The October 2023 rating decision also grated service connection for HHD as secondary to now service-connected hypertension, assigning August 10, 2022, as the effective date.

The Board concludes that an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension under the Pact Act and for HHD as secondary to hypertension is not warranted. 

The Veteran's claim of service connection for hypertension was granted pursuant to the PACT Act, which added hypertension to the list of presumptive diseases, and thus this award of service connection was based on liberalizing law. His claim of service connection for HHD was granted as secondary to hypertension. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, an effective date of the grant pursuant to the PACT Act, the liberalizing law, cannot be earlier than the effective date of the PACT Act, August 10, 2022. See Pub. L. 117-168; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110; Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). As such, an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension pursuant to PACT Act is not warranted. Moreover, the effective date for service connection for HHD cannot be earlier than that of hypertension, the underlying disability because entitlement to secondary service connection does not arise until the underlying disability is service connected. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.310, 3.400.

Accordingly, as there is no basis on which to grant an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension and HHD pursuant to PACT Act, the claims are denied. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1116A (c), 5110(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155(b), 3.400(b)(2). 

Evaluations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of any disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Although the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings, the Board is to consider the Veteran's medical history in determining the applicability of a higher rating for the entire period in which the appeal has been pending. Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999).

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings). When adjudicating a claim for an increased initial evaluation, the relevant time period is from the date of the claim. Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 215 (2007), rev'd in irrelevant part, Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (2009). When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed. Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for RLE PN.

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for LLE PN.

In June 2021, the AOJ received the Veteran's claim for increased rating for his service connected BLE PN. A September 2021 decision continued the 10 percent rating for RLE PN and 10 percent for LLE PN. IN September 2022, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0996 HLR Review Request of the September 2021 rating decision. A December 2022 HLR decision continued the 10 percent rating for each lower extremity. In November 2023, within a year, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, supplemental claim, appealing the the 10 percent rating assigned for each lower extremity. Thereafter, in April 2024, the AOJ issued a supplemental claim decision, continuing the 10 percent rating for RLE PN and 10 percent rating for LLE PN. This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision. See VA Form 10182 (February 2025). Thus, the relevant rating review period begins on June 1, 2021, with a one year look back year prior to that date-the date VA received the claim for increase; and ends on April 15, 2024, the date of the rating decision on appeal.

The Veteran, including via his attorney, contends that higher ratings are warranted for his BLE PN. In July 2021, he reported bilateral foot numbness, inability to balance on one foot or to propel himself forward; he also reported tripping due to his BLE PN and tending to drag his feet.  See VA Form 21-10210 - Lay Witness Statement (July 2021). He also submitted a statement from his wife that reflects that the Veteran tripped frequently while using the stairs, was unable to stand on his toes, and that he almost shuffled when walking. See VA Form 21-10210 - Lay Witness Statement (July 2021). In support of his contentions, the Veteran, in September 2021, also provided a private medical opinion (PMO) from T. B, DC, dated in August 2021. 

The Board concludes that, prior to October 6, 2022, the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for RLE PN and in excess of 10 percent for LLE PN are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.123, 4.124, 4.124A, Diagnostic Code 8525. The Board concludes that, from October 6, 2022, the criteria for a rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for RLE PN and of 20 percent, but no higher, for LLE PN are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.123, 4.124, 4.124A, Diagnostic Code 8520.

It is noted that a March 2024 rating decision changed the Diagnostic Code for rating the Veteran's LLE PN from Diagnostic Code 8520, for paralysis of sciatic nerve, to Diagnostic Code 8525, for paralysis of posterior tibial nerve. The assignment of a particular Diagnostic Code is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case." Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993). One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology. Any change in diagnostic code by a VA adjudicator must be specifically explained. Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625, 629 (1992). It is permissible to switch diagnostic codes to reflect more accurately a claimant's current symptoms. See Read v. Shinseki, 651 F.3d 1296, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2011).

The Board's duty to maximize benefits includes consideration of whether other diagnostic codes would be appropriate to evaluate symptoms of the Veteran's disability. When a particular service-connected disability is not listed in the rating schedule, it may be rated by analogy to a closely related disease in which not only the functions affected, but also the anatomical location and symptomatology are

As will be explained in further detail below, the Board finds that Diagnostic Code 8525 was appropriate for evaluating BLE PN prior to the October 2022 PN DQ, and that Diagnostic Code 8520 is more appropriate for BLE PN from October 2022. The Board notes that the Court has held that the selection of a particular Diagnostic Code "is a determination that is completely dependent upon the facts of a particular case," and the Board has discretion in determining the appropriate diagnostic Code. Butts, 5 Vet. App. at 538 (applying the more deferential "arbitrary, capricious" standard, rather than de novo review, to the Board's determination of the appropriate Diagnostic Code). Accordingly, the BLE PN will be rated under Diagnostic Code 8525 prior to October 6, 2022, and under Diagnostic Code 8520 thereafter. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79; Lendermann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

The Veteran's RLE PN is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8525, posterior tibial nerve. Prior to March 15, 2024, the Veteran's LLE PN was rated under Diagnostic Code 8525, posterior tibial nerve; from March 15, 2024, it is rated under Diagnostic Code 8520, sciatic nerve.

Diagnostic Code 8525 rates incomplete or complete paralysis of the posterior tibial nerve. Mild or moderate incomplete paralysis warrants a 10 percent disability rating; severe incomplete paralysis warrants a 20 percent disability rating; and complete paralysis warrants a 30 percent rating. Complete paralysis of the posterior tibial nerve causes paralysis of all muscles of the sole of the foot, frequently with painful paralysis of a causalgic nature; inability to flex the toes; weakened adduction; and impaired plantar flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. 

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy, is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various diagnostic codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. 4.6. The use of the terminology within a VA examination report, moreover, is not in and of itself dispositive. Id. 

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

Turning to the evidence of record, a July 2021 Central Nervous System and Neuromuscular Diseases DBQ reflects normal gait and reflexes, and no muscle atrophy. See C&P Exam (July 2021). An August 2021 Peripheral Nerves Conditions DBQ reflects BLE mild numbness, constant pain, and moderate intermittent pain and paresthesia. See C&P Exam (August 2021). Ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion muscle strength was normal, 5/5. His BLE sensory exam and reflex exam were also normal. Trophic changes were notes as loss of lower exterior hair along with smooth shiny skin. Gait was indicated as normal with no assistive device being used. The Veteran was assessed with BLE mild incomplete paralysis of posterior tibial nerve. Functionally, the impact of BLE PN was described as inability to stand or walk too long; and inability to due house or yard work as he had to sit down after few minutes due to neuropathy.

A June 2021 private treatment note shows advanced trophic changes, decreased temperature and paresthesias in the BLEs. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 11 (April 2023). A private evaluation, submitted in August 2022 and dated in July 2021, from M.S., MD, notes the Veteran's difficulty balancing due to BLE PN. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 36 (August 2022). A September 2021 PMO, completed by T. B, DC, reflects that the Veteran's BLE PN involved his sciatic and common peroneal nerves that contributed to the symptoms associated with the loss of use of his feet; and that his BLE radiculopathy was severe, causing loss of use of his feet. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (September 2021). A November 2021 private treatment note reflects normal sensory and muscle evaluation other than 4/5 on left plantar flexion. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 19 (September 2022). A June 2022 private treatment note shows antalgic gait, normal sensory appreciation, normal reflexes and muscle strength with the exception of 4/5 on left plantar flexion. See id. at 14-15. Post-operative report, dated in June 2022, shows BLE weakness. Id. at 9. Private treatment records submitted in September 2022, show that, in June 2022, after the Veteran's lumbar surgery, his BLE reflexes were normal as was his muscle strength (5/5). See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 7 (September 2022).

An October 2022 Diabetic Sensory - Motor Peripheral Neuropathy DBQ shows moderate intermittent pain, paresthesias and numbness in BLEs; normal muscle strength, normal reflexes, no trophic changes, decreased light touch/monofilaments testing for foot/toes; no muscle atrophy; and indicates moderate sciatic nerve incomplete paralysis. In terms of functional impact, it was noted that the Veteran had difficulty with tasks that required putting pressure or weight on his feet, such as standing, walking, running, climbing stairs, squatting, or lifting.

A January 2023 private treatment note shows that BLE reflexes and paresthesias were normal. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (April 2023).

A March 2024 Diabetic Sensory - Motor Peripheral Neuropathy DBQ shows mild numbness in the BLEs, normal muscle movement, normal reflexes, and decreased light touch/monofilament testing results in the ankle/lower leg and foot/toes. See C&P Exam (March 2024). There was also no muscle atrophy and no trophic changes. Peripheral neuropathy was only indicated on the LLE, described as mild incomplete paralysis of LLE sciatic nerve. 

Initially, prior to October 6, 2022, the Board finds that ratings in excess of 10 percent for RLE and in excess of 10 percent for LLE are not warranted based on the evidence of record. Prior to October 6, 2022, the Veteran's RLE PN and LLE PN were rated under Diagnostic Code 8525, under which a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted for either as there is no competent evidence establishing the presence of severe incomplete or complete paralysis of all muscle of the sole of the foot, inability to flex toes, weakened adduction, and impaired plantar flexion at any point during pendency of appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8525. Prior to October 6, 2022, the Veteran's BLE PN symptomatology is manifested by no more than decreased sensation, decreased muscle strength, trophic changes, and mildly antalgic gait, and without evidence of muscle atrophy. Notably, the August 2021 DBQ only documented BLE mild incomplete paralysis of the posterior tibial nerve. While the record documents abnormal gait, difficulty with walking, and need to take breaks from standing and walking due to BLE pain, those findings are associated with service-connected right hip disability and bilateral knee disabilities, and the same symptomatology cannot be used to support a higher rating of the posterior tibial nerve. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. Additionally, while the Veteran reported weakness almost falling multiple times due to BLE PN, physical evaluations of BLE PN showed normal muscle strength, sensory and reflex examinations, and normal gait without using any assistive devices; and his inability to stand or walk for long periods of time is contemplated under the rating assigned pursuant to BLE PN. Additionally, the Veteran-provided private treatment records continuously show normal sensory and muscle evaluations as well as normal reflexes, including after the Veteran's June 2022 lumbar spine surgery, after which antalgic gait was noted. Ultimately, neither private nor VA treatment records reflect that he sustained any falls, including a February 2021 VA treatment note, where he reported no falls in the previous year, and no altered gait; his fall risk assessment was 1/10 in October 2021. See CAPRI at 16, 49 (March 2024), Private treatment records show gait antalgia due to physiological splinting in January 2021, not due to either RLE or LLE PN. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 17 (April 2023). Moreover, as stated above, there are no findings which are not already considered by the 10 percent rating for RLE and 10 percent for LLE PN that would warrant assignment of severe or complete paralysis disability rating for posterior tibial nerves. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8525.

From October 6, 2022, the evidence of record more closely approximates moderate incomplete paralysis of sciatic nerve impairment in each leg, which supports the assignment of 20 percent rating for RLE PN and a 20 percent rating for LLE PN. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. In this regard, the October 2022 PN DBQ notes moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve in the RLE and in the LLE. Additionally, the Veteran's symptoms included decreased light touch/monofilaments testing for foot/toes; and difficulty with tasks that required putting pressure or weight on his feet, such as standing, walking, running, climbing stairs, squatting, or lifting. 

However, at no point after October 6, 2022, does the evidence demonstrate that the Veteran's RLE PN or LLE PN more closely approximated the criteria for a rating in excess of 20 percent in either lower extremity. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. In order to obtain the next higher rating, the Veteran's sciatic nerve involvement must show at least moderately severe incomplete paralysis. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. However, the findings from the VA treatment records and DBQ reports reveal, at most, moderately severe symptoms of sciatic nerve in each leg. See C&P Exam (October 2022); C&P Exam (March 2024).

In this regard, the October 2022 DBQ shows normal muscle strength, normal reflexes, no trophic changes and no muscle atrophy in either RLE or LLE. Notably, the March 2024 DBQ reflects incomplete paralysis only in LLE sciatic nerve, which it characterized as mild. A March 2023 VA treatment note shows that the Veteran continued to golf regularly. See CAPRI at 1 (March 2024). Such findings do not demonstrate more than moderate impairment in either leg to support a rating higher than 20 percent.

With regard to Diagnostic Code 8525, under which the Veteran's RLE PN and LLE PN prior to March 2024 was rated, applies to posterior tibial nerve; however, the October 2022 and March 2024 DBQs do not show posterior tibial nerve paralysis, instead showing sciatic nerve paralysis. Therefore, Diagnostic Code 8525 is not for application from October 6, 2022.

The Board accepts that the Veteran believes his RLE PN and LLE PN symptoms warrant a higher rating in each lower extremity. However, whether a disability meets the schedular criteria for the assignment of a higher evaluation is a factual determination by the Board based on the Veteran's complaints coupled with the medical evidence. Both the lay and medical evidence are probative in this case. Although the Veteran contends that he meets the criteria for the next higher disability rating, his complaints along with the medical findings do not meet the schedular requirements for higher evaluations than now assigned, as explained above. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8525, 8520. Further, the Board assigns greater probative value to the medical evidence, to include the multiple VA examination reports as they were prepared by skilled, neutral medical professionals after evaluating the Veteran and review of the record.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected. Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.

The Board acknowledges the August 2021 PMO by T. B., DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) that reflects that the Veteran's sciatic and common peroneal nerves contributed to the symptoms associated with the loss of use of his feet; and that his BLE radiculopathy was severe, causing loss of use of his feet. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (September 2021). The Board finds that this PMO has no probative value because it is based on inaccurate facts. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (A medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value). The PMO misrepresents the medical evidence of record and includes evaluations and treatment, not just opinions, and reflects that the Veteran's BLE PN manifested in his posterior tibial nerves, bilaterally, not sciatic or common peroneal. Such inaccuracies without evaluating the Veteran cast doubt on the August 2021 opinion's foundation and, accordingly, the Board finds the opinion inadequate to support a higher rating prior to October 6, 2022.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence supports the assignment of a 20 percent rating for RLE PN and a 20 percent rating for LL PN from October 6, 2022. However, the record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for RLE and in excess of 10 percent for LLE PN  prior to October 6, 2022. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against higher ratings, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for service connection for hypertension on basis other than the PACT Act presumption is remanded.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for service connection for HDD, to include as secondary to hypertension on basis other than the PACT Act presumption, is remanded.

The Veteran contends that an effective date of June 2021, the date of his original claim for service connection for hypertension is warranted for the grant of service connection, based on his continuous litigation. See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (October 2024); VA Form 10182 (February 2025). He contends that the effective date of June 2021 is also warranted to his HHD, because such is secondary to hypertension, and that he has also continuously litigated his claim for HHD. 

The issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension and HHD, other than pursuant to PACT Act, is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the February 2025 rating decision on appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

VA's duty to assist claimants in the development of their claims includes obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Further, once an examination or opinion is obtained, VA must ensure that it is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate).

Here, the AOJ obtained a March 2023 VA examination and opinion (VAMO). See C&P Exam (March 2023). The VA examination reflects diagnoses of hypertension and HHD. The VAMO concludes that the Veteran's hypertension "was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness," stating that the Veteran qualifies for a presumption of exposure to Agent Orange. See C&P Exam at 4 (March 2023). However, the rationale for the conclusion is absent, including no consideration of the Veteran's conceded exposure to herbicide agents directly causing the Veteran's hypertension. As such, apart from recognizing hypertension as a presumptive disease pursuant to eh PACT Act, the VAMO does not support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate for the Board to consider and weigh against other evidence of record. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 102, 124-25 l see also Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012) (providing that an adequate medical examination report or opinion must "sufficiently inform the Board of a medical expert's judgment on a medical question and the essential rationale for that opinion"). Therefore, remand is required for a new VAMO that addresses whether the Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents at least as likely as not caused his hypertension. 

Given that the March 2023 VAMO concluded that the Veteran's HHD is secondary to his hypertension, the claim is intertwined with the determination of whether conceded herbicide exposure directly caused the Veteran's hypertension. 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

(Continued on the next page)

?

Obtain an addendum opinion to address the etiology of the Veteran's hypertension. The entire claims file, to include a copy of this REMAND, should be made available to and reviewed by the clinician. Note that the phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal. The clinician should address:

Whether the Veteran's hypertension is, at least as likely as not, related to conceded in-service exposure to herbicide agents. Consider the date of onset of hypertension reported as 2015. See C&P Exam at 2 (March 2023). Explain.
