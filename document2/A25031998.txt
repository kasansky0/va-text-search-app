REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for hypothyroidism is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for left ankle pain (claimed as bilateral ankle pain) is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for right ankle pain (claimed as bilateral ankle pain) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2009 to January 2023.

The claim for a compensable evaluation for service-connected hypothyroidism comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision. The claims for service connection for left and right ankle disabilities come before the Board on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, as to the evaluation of service-connected hypothyroidism, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. As to the claims for service connection for left and right ankle disabilities, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

VA has a duty to assist Veterans and must provide a medical examination or obtain a medical opinion when necessary to decide on a claim. § 5103A(d)(1); § 3.159(c)(4). Once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination, the examination must be adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). To be adequate, a medical examination report must contain clear conclusions with supporting data and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008). Failure to provide an adequate opinion is a duty to assist error, and, unless the issue can be granted in full, the issue shall be remanded to the AOJ for correction of the error. § 5013A(f); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

1. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected hypothyroidism.

A May 2023 rating decision granted service connection and assigned an initial 30 percent rating for hypothyroidism effective January 10, 2023. In a June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ determined the May 2023 rating decision contained clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in that the initial 30 percent rating was erroneous and assigned a noncompensable from January 10, 2023. 

A CUE motion is a collateral attack on a final AOJ decision. See 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). Although the Veteran disagrees with the June 2023 rating decision finding the assignment of the initial rating in the May 2023 rating decision was erroneous and adjusting the evaluation, the May 2023 rating decision was not final. Thus, it is not subject to reversal or revision based on CUE. An assertion of CUE is a collateral attack on an otherwise final decision by the AOJ. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a); see also Smith v. Brown, 35 F.3d 1516, 1527 (Fed. Cir. 1994). A rating decision is final as of the date it is mailed to the claimant if not appealed within one year. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 20.200, 20.1103. An assertion of CUE cannot be filed as to a matter that is still appealable or pending. May v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 310, 320 (2005). Because the May 2023 rating decision did not become final, the Veteran need not show the elevated standard of CUE to achieve an increased rating if such is warranted. Further, the May 2024 VA 10182 does not assert CUE but instead disagrees with the hypothyroidism evaluation. See May 2024 VA 10182. The Board may review the assigned rating de novo and has recharacterized the issue on appeal as entitlement to a compensable evaluation for hypothyroidism.

The Veteran's hypothyroidism was evaluated based on a November 2022 VA examination, which is inadequate. The Veteran stated his current hypothyroid symptoms are fatigue, depression, brittle nails, weight gain, and low libido. See November 2022 VA examination. However, the examiner, without addressing these reported symptoms, determined the Veteran had no signs or symptoms of a thyroid condition, including hypothyroidism. The Board cannot ascertain if the Veteran's reported symptoms are manifestations of his hypothyroidism or a separate disability. Therefore, the claim is remanded for an addendum opinion addressing the Veteran's symptoms.

2. Service connection for left ankle pain (claimed as bilateral ankle pain).

3. Service connection for right ankle pain (claimed as bilateral ankle pain).

These claims are also remanded for a pre-decisional duty to assist error; to obtain an adequate VA examination and medical opinion. 

A disability is any condition that results in functional impairment of earning capacity, and pain alone may constitute a disability, even without identifying underlying pathology, when such pain results in functional impairment. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The October 2023 VA examination found no ankle disability stating the Veteran's pain was subjective. This is inadequate as the examiner did not consider the Veteran's symptom of pain and resulting functional impact, including limited running, jumping, prolonged ambulation, prolonged standing, high impact, instability, and decreased range of motion during flare ups. See October 2023 VA examination. 

Additionally, the negative nexus opinion incorrectly relies on the lack of ankle trouble in the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs). An August 2009 STR shows the Veteran complained of right ankle pain with a diagnosis of right ankle strain, treated with ibuprofen for pain/swelling. A December 2010 STR states the Veteran rolled his left ankle for the second time in two weeks and an x-ray determined the Veteran had an avulsion fracture of lateral aspect of tarsal bones with adjacent soft tissue swelling. On remand, the evidence of in-service injuries to his left and right ankles must be evaluated in a medical opinion. 

The AOJ has failed to provide adequate medical opinions, a duty to assist error has occurred, and the claims are remanded to the AOJ for correction of the error. § 5013A(f); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the current symptoms, level of severity, and functional impact associated with his hypothyroidism. The examiner should complete the appropriate Disability Benefits Questionnaire. Copies of all pertinent records must be made available to the examiner for review.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination with an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and likely etiology of the Veteran's right and left ankle disabilities. Copies of all pertinent records should be made available to the examiner for review. Based on the examination and review of the record, the examiner is asked to answer the following:

(a) Identify any currently diagnosed ankle disability. If no pathology is present but the Veteran exhibits symptoms that cause functional impairment in earning capacity, then the examiner should consider them a disability for purposes of providing the requested opinion. 

(b) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any diagnosed ankle disability or related functional impairment began in or was due to service?

In providing the requested opinion, the examiner should consider and discuss all pertinent medical and lay evidence of record, to include August 2009 and December 2012 STRs showing ankle injuries and pain in service. 

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions, citing to supporting factual data and medical literature, as appropriate. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner must state why and what, if any, additional evidence would permit such an opinion to be made.
