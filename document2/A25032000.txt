ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has not had a hypertension disability for VA purposes during the appeal period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from June 1977 to July 1980. The Veteran also served as a member for the Air Force National Guard.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran timely submitted his VA Form 10182 in March 2024. In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the direct review docket. See March 2024 VA Form 10182.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service connection for hypertension is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for hypertension due to his deployment to locations related to the PACT Act. See December 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). 

The Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has a current hypertension disability for VA purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101, Note 1.

Legal Principles

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Hypertension is a chronic disease presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if shown as chronic in service; or, if it manifested to a compensable degree within a year following separation from service; or, if it was noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Moreover, if a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during service, certain specified disabilities shall be service connected if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6) are met, even though there was no record of such disease during service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d) are also satisfied. Hypertension is among the specified disabilities.

For purposes of establishing service connection for a disability resulting from exposure to an herbicide agent, a veteran with qualifying service in specified locations during certain time periods shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, absent affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(d)(1).

The availability of presumptive service connection for a disability based on exposure to herbicides does not preclude a veteran from establishing service connection with proof of direct causation, or on any other recognized basis. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Whether service connection is claimed on direct, presumptive, or any other basis, a necessary element for establishing such a claim is the existence of a current disability within the appellate period. See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1333 (1997). The presence of a current disability is the cornerstone of any service connection claim. Service connection is not warranted when there is no current disability. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992). Current means near the time a claim is filed or at any time during its pendency. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, VA shall give benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101, Note (1), hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days. For purposes of this section, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90 mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160 mm. or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm.

The claim must be denied due to no current disability.

Analysis

In the instant appeal, the RO has made a favorable finding that the Veteran had participation in toxic exposure risk activity while serving in Iraq in 2003 and 2004.

That said, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim based on the absence of a current diagnosis of hypertension (for VA purposes). See March 2024 Rating Decision. After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds the evidence to be persuasively against a finding of a current disability, and service connection must therefore be denied.

For VA purposes, hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days. The term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101, Note 1.

Review of the Veteran's treatment records show a diagnosis of benign essential hypertension in October 2023. The Veteran's blood pressure reading at the time was 130 over 88, and it was noted that his blood pressure was "slightly above goal."

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2024. The Veteran reported he was not taking any medications for hypertension because there were no "three strikes" of high blood pressure indicated at his doctor's visits. The examiner noted that the Veteran's reading on January 29, 2024, was 151/84 and 161/85; on February 16, 2024, 152/80 and 150/80; and, on February 17, 2024, 162/86 and 160/78.

The Veteran does not meet the criteria for a VA disability of hypertension, as he has not had diastolic blood pressures of predominantly 90 mm. or greater, or systolic blood pressures of predominantly 160 mm. or greater with diastolic blood pressures of less than 90 mm.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that he has a diagnosis of hypertension, due to his participation in toxic risk exposure activity. As a layperson, however, he is not capable of making medical conclusions; thus, these statements are not competent evidence. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Lay statements may be competent to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation. Id.; see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support presence of disability even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence). Cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension, are complex disorders which require specialized training for a determination as to diagnosis and causation, and they are therefore not susceptible of lay opinions on etiology, and lay statements therein cannot be accepted as competent evidence. Id.

Finally, the Veteran's VA treatment records show that he has been diagnosed with hypertension. However, those records are also afforded little probative weight as the diagnosis of hypertension did not meet the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101, Note 1.

Accordingly, there is not an approximate balance of evidence for versus against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021). In fact, the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim. There is no argument or suggestion that any outstanding treatment records that would show higher blood pressure readings or a diagnosis or treatment for hypertension, or that a VA examination would have a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim. Thus, no remand is needed.

The claim for service connection for hypertension must be denied due to no current disability at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. See Romanowsky, supra; McClain, supra. Hypertension must be shown by objective testing pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104; thus, any impairment of earning capacity due to symptoms related to hypertension may not establish a disability.

In summary, the evidence is not in at least relative equipoise, and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved in the Veteran's favor. The appeal must be denied.
