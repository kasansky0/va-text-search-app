3. New evidence that is relevant to the claim of entitlement to a higher initial rating for headaches syndrome has been received since the September 2024 decision that assigned an initial rating.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. From December 12, 2024, the criteria for entitlement to a rating of 30 percent for left shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to readjudication of the claim for a higher initial rating for headaches syndrome, based on new and relevant evidence, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from December 1956 to December 1958, with additional periods of active duty for training and inactive duty training before and after this period of active duty.  The Veteran has also been found to have a period of active service from December 4 through December 9, 1987, due to the aggravation of his left leg varicose vein disability during active duty for training.  See 38 C.F.R. § 17.31(a)(2); July 2018 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision; see also February 22, 2019 deferred rating decision.

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, for the issues the Board is remanding, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

As an initial matter, the Board finds the ratings on appeal are initial ratings.  The Veteran was granted service connection and assigned initial ratings for his left shoulder, bilateral knee, right leg varicose veins, and headache disabilities in rating decisions issued between March and September 2024.   Within one year of these decisions, the Veteran submitted supplemental claims that led to the decisions on appeal.  See October 2, 2024 and October 11, 2024 supplemental claims.  Therefore, the Veteran has continuously pursued the appropriate initial rating for his disabilities, and the Board must consider the initial ratings from April 19, 2014 for his left shoulder and right leg varicose veins disabilities, and from September 28, 2016 for his left knee, right knee, and headache disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h).

1. Entitlement to an initial rating of 30 percent for left shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis 

The Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 20 percent for his service connected left shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis.  Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds a 30 percent rating is warranted from December 12, 2024. 

The Veteran's left shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201, for limitation of motion of arm.  Under Diagnostic Code 5201, limitation of motion of the arm to 25 degrees from side warrants a maximum 30 percent rating for the minor joint and a maximum 40 percent rating for the major joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201.  

Diagnostic Code 5201 "does not provide separate ratings for limitation of motion in the flexion and abduction planes, but rather is addressed generically to limitation of motion of the arm."  Yonek v. Shinseki, 722 F.3d 1355, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended Diagnostic Code 5201 to reflect that limitation of motion may be shown by flexion and/or abduction and clarified the degrees of limitation of motion that correspond to each rating.  Now, limitation of motion at the shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees) warrants a 20 percent rating for both the major and minor extremity.  Limitation of motion of the arm midway between side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees) warrants a 20 percent rating for the minor extremity and a 30 percent rating for the major extremity.  Flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from the side warrants a maximum 30 percent rating for the minor joint and a maximum 40 percent rating for the major joint.

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran is right-handed.  Therefore, the Veteran's left shoulder is part of the minor extremity, so the highest schedular rating for limitation of motion of the arm is 30 percent.

The Veteran attended a VA shoulder examination on December 12, 2024.  On examination, the examiner found the Veteran's abduction range of motion was limited to 45 degrees.  However, upon repetitive use testing, the Veteran's abduction was limited to 30 degrees.  As noted above, abduction limited to 25 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating, and abduction limited to 45 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating. 

"Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned."  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Here the Veteran's abduction was limited to 30 degrees upon repetitive use testing.  Such limitation more nearly approximates abduction limited to 25 degrees than a limitation to 45 degrees.  Therefore, the Board finds the higher rating of 30 percent is warranted from the date of the examination.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Whether an increased rating is warranted prior to this date is addressed in the remand section below.

The Board has considered whether any other diagnostic codes related to disabilities of the shoulder would provide for a higher or separate disability rating.  However, the Veteran does not contend, and the evidence does not reflect, that the symptoms would warrant a higher or separate rating under a different diagnostic code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; December 2024 shoulder examination report (not evidencing additional diagnostic codes would be applicable).

2. Entitlement to readjudication of the initial rating for headaches syndrome

The Veteran was granted service connection for his headache disability in September 2024 and assigned an initial staged rating.  See September 2024 Board decision; September 2024 rating decision.  On October 11, 2024, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim disagreeing with the initial rating for his headache disability.  The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim in a January 2025 rating decision, finding that private medical records the Veteran identified were not new and relevant evidence.

VA will readjudicate a previously denied claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured.  38 U.S.C. § 5108(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).  New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim and includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).  In determining whether new and relevant evidence is presented or secured, VA will consider any VA treatment records reasonably identified by the claimant and any evidence received by VA after VA issued notice of a decision on the claim and while the evidentiary record was closed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  When a supplemental claim has been submitted, the evidentiary record includes evidence received by VA before the issuance of notice of a decision on the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(b). 

The evidence received since the September 2024 rating decision includes evidence that is both new and relevant to the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).  For example, an October 2024 VA treatment record notes the frequency of the Veteran's headaches have decreased.  See October 8, 2024 VA medical record (also noting acetaminophen has helped with headaches, and also indicating that the Veteran's hypertension medication Verapamil is also used for his headache disability).  This evidence was not previously before adjudicators in September 2024, and "tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).  Accordingly, new and relevant evidence was received prior to the January 2025 decision on appeal, and the claim should be readjudicated taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for headaches syndrome prior to October 23, 2023, and a compensable rating thereafter, is remanded.

The Board finds that a pre-decisional error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty occurred when the AOJ determined readjudication of the claim regarding headaches syndrome was not warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5108(a) (VA "shall readjudicate the claim" when new and relevant evidence is received); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501, 20.802(a).  Thus, remand is necessary so that the claim can be readjudicated.

2. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for left shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis, prior to December 12, 2024, is remanded.

3. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right leg varicose veins is remanded.

4. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain is remanded.

5. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee strain is remanded.

For the Veteran's headache, left shoulder, right leg varicose veins and bilateral knee disability claims, remand is warranted for additional medical opinions.

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that the Board may not deny a higher rating on the basis of "relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria."? Jones v. Shinseki, 26?Vet. App.?56, 63 (2012). 

A remand is necessary to determine the nature and severity of the Veteran's disabilities while discounting the?ameliorative effects of medication.  The evidence of record establishes that the Veteran takes medication for his headache, shoulder, knee and varicose vein disabilities; however, it is not clear whether any examiner discounted the ameliorative effects of the Veteran's medication when evaluating his symptoms.  See Jones v. Shinseki,?26?Vet. App.?56?(2012) (holding that the?ameliorative effects of medication?may not be considered in assigning a disability rating where these effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria).?  The Veteran has attended examinations for his claims, and reported medication use, but the examiners did not address whether the ameliorative effects of medication were considered when addressing the Veteran's symptoms.  See, e.g., October 2023 VA headache examination report (Tylenol); December 2024 VA knee (Tylenol), varicose veins (Asprin) and shoulder (Tylenol) examinations reports.  Furthermore, the Veteran takes several other medications they may affect his disabilities, despite them not being reported during his VA compensation examinations.  See, e.g., May 7, 2024 VA treatment record (indicating that the Veteran's hypertension medication Verapamil is also used for his headache disability).  Therefore, the AOJ erred in not obtaining addendum opinions that address the ameliorative effects of medication on the Veteran's disabilities.  

Additionally, additional opinions are required to ensure an adequate description of the Veteran's functional loss due to repeated use are obtained.  For example, the Veteran attended a VA shoulder examination in April 2018, and the examiner found the Veteran's pain causes functional loss with repeated use over a period of time, but was unable to describe this loss in terms of ranges of motion.  The examiner explained the Veteran reports pain in all planes of motion.  While the examiner stated that an opinion could not be provided, the examiner did not indicate why, e.g., due to lack of knowledge within the medical community.  This was an error.  See Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 34-36 (2017) (relying on Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382 (2010)).   Therefore, remand is warranted to obtain medical opinions that comply with Sharp.

6. Entitlement to a separate compensable rating for left knee instability is remanded.

7. Entitlement to a separate compensable rating for right knee instability is remanded.

The Board finds the issue of entitlement to a separated compensable rating for right and left knee instability disabilities have been raised by the record as part of evaluating the Veteran's service connected right and left knee disability.  Therefore, these issues must be addressed by the Board.  See Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 197-203 (2021).  

Review of a December 2024 knee examination report reveals conflicting information regarding whether the Veteran suffers from knee instability.  The examiner noted the Veteran did not report, and does not have, a history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the knee.  See 2024 December knee examination report, page 4.  On examination the examiner also checked boxes indicating there is no recurrent patellar instability, or recurrent subluxation or persistent instability, of either knee.  Id., at page 8.  However, the examination report also indicates the Veteran regularly uses a cane, because he "[n]eeds a cane for balance and stability."  Id., at pages 10-11.  Furthermore, treatment records raise the possibility of knee instability. 

For example, in January 2024, the Veteran reported a fall approximately one month prior "when he was coming down some steps and his knee gave out on him."  January 23, 2024 private treatment record (emphasis added).  The specific knee was not identified.  In July 2024, this same or similar fall was also reported.  See July 25, 2024 treatment record.  Additionally, the treating doctor noted, "We discussed that he likely has multifactorial gait disorder secondary to his peripheral sensory neuropathy and orthopedic issues, particularly with his knee.  He should continue with physical therapy and would likely benefit from further evaluation of his knee and whether injections, brace, targeted therapy would be of benefit."  July 25, 2024 treatment record (emphasis added).  Again, the particular knee was not identified, but like with the January 2024 record, the past medical history included left knee pain.  Furthermore, earlier in July 2024, the Veteran reported "some increased knee buckling last week."  See July16, 2024 treatment record (diagnoses were impaired gait and mobility, and impairment of balance).  The particular knee was not identified, but bilateral knee pain was noted.  Id.

Given the internal inconsistency of the December 2024 VA examination report, and the lack of specificity in the treatment records, the AOJ erred in not obtaining additional medical opinions regarding instability.  Such additional evidence would be relevant in determining the severity and potential type of disability, e.g., patellar instability or recurrent subluxation.  Therefore, remand is warranted to obtain additional medical opinions on the current and historical severity of the Veteran's right and left knee disabilities, including whether he has a right or left knee instability disability.

8. Entitlement to total disability rating for individual unemployability from September 28, 2016 to October 1, 2023, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), is remanded.

9. Entitlement to total disability rating for individual unemployability from April 19, 2014, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b), is remanded.

The Veteran was granted a total disability rating for individual unemployability effective October 2, 2023 in a January 2015 rating decision.

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for the grant of a total disability rating for individual unemployability (TDIU), both on a schedular and extra-schedular basis.  See February 2025 notice of disagreement, page 9 (letter from representative).  An attempt to obtain a TDIU is an attempt to receive the correct rating for a disability or disabilities.  Therefore, the errors identified above regarding the Veteran's disabilities apply to his TDIU claim.  Accordingly, remand is warranted.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current and historical severity of his service connected headache disability.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria, including changes in symptoms or their severity during the period on appeal (from September 28, 2016). 

The examiner must discount the ameliorative effects of medication, including medications not specifically prescribed for the disability.  In other words, opine on the historical severity of the Veteran's disability if he had not taken any medication, including but not limited to Tylenol and Verapamil.   The examiner is specifically asked to opine whether it is at least as likely as not the Veteran would have had very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability if he did not take medication.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current and historical severity of his service connected left and right knee disabilities.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disabilities and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disabilities under the rating criteria, including changes in symptoms or their severity during the period on appeal (from September 28, 2016).   

In doing so the examiner must opine whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's left and right knee disabilities manifests in instability.  See treatment records dated January 23, 2024 ("his knee gave out on him"), January 25, 2024 ("likely has multifactorial gait disorder secondary to his peripheral sensory neuropathy and orthopedic issues, particularly with his knee"), July 16, 2024 ("some increased knee buckling last week").

The examiner must discount the ameliorative effects of medication, including medications not specifically prescribed for the disabilities.  In other words, opine on the historical severity of the Veteran's disabilities if he had not taken any medication, including when estimating ranges of motion that are limited by pain. 

3. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current and historical severity of his service connected left shoulder disability.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria, including changes in symptoms or their severity during the period on appeal (from April 19, 2014).   

In doing so, and to the extent possible, the examiner should opine the date when the Veteran's limitation of abduction to 30 degrees or worse during repetitive use began.  See, e.g., private treatment records dated May 28, 2024 (pain limiting motion) and July 31, 2024 (Veteran has noticed left shoulder pain more with increased trekking pole use); December 2024 VA shoulder examination.

The examiner must discount the ameliorative effects of medication, including medications not specifically prescribed for the disability.  In other words, opine on the historical severity of the Veteran's disability if he had not taken any medication, including when estimating ranges of motion limited by pain. 

4. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current and historical severity of his service connected right leg varicose veins disability.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria, including changes in symptoms or their severity during the period on appeal (from April 19, 2014).

The examiner must discount the ameliorative effects of medication, including medications not specifically prescribed for the disability.  In other words, opine on the historical severity of the Veteran's disability if he had not taken any medication.   The examiner is specifically asked to opine whether it is at least as likely as not the Veteran's disability would manifest in edema, eczema, or ulceration if he did not take medication.

5. Readjudicate the Veteran's claims.  The AOJ is reminded that these are initial ratings, so they should be considered from April 19, 2014 (varicose veins and shoulder) or September 28, 2016 (knees and headaches), including entitlement to a TDIU from April 19, 2014.  

(Continued on the next page)

?

The AOJ must also ensure examinations and opinions are legally adequate, including ensuring compliance with Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).  The AOJ should let examiners know of any change in rating criteria during the periods on appeal.
