ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for gastrointestinal signs or symptoms is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is persuasively weighted against finding that the Veteran has a gastrointestinal disability that was incurred in or is causally related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for gastrointestinal signs or symptoms have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 1118, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Army from February 2008 to August 2008 and from December 2009 to August 2010. 

This matter was appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2024 rating decision through submission of a June 2024 VA Form 10182 with election of the direct review appeal docket. 

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the AOJ requested the Veteran submit any relevant private treatment records or submit information with which VA can assist the Veteran in obtaining private treatment records. Required notice and information were provided in the claim form which the Veteran signed, certifying to the fact that such notice was received and further than they have included or identified relevant evidence. VA requested records for which the Veteran submitted a proper release and/or adequately identified. The duty to assist is not a one-way street. If a Veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining evidence. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). Thus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the duty to assist. No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in development. Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).

The standard set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(iii) only permits constructive receipt of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records that not only existed prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, but also for which the claimant furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of those records. Thus, the Board's consideration of VHA records is limited to the same. Here, the Board finds that VA treatment records were obtained and reviewed consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) and the AMA framework.

38 C.F.R. § 3.103 provides that a Veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim. The Board observes that notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing at the AOJ was not provided in this case. In Bowen, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested hearing before the AOJ because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a hearing before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253 (2012). Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket. Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.

Service connection for gastrointestinal signs or symptoms 

Legal Criteria 

Service connection means that a veteran has a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence shows that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Entitlement to service connection is established when the following elements are satisfied: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or "medical nexus" between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Service connection may be warranted for a Persian Gulf veteran who exhibits objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability that became manifest during active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 31, 2026. 38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317. For purposes of section 3.317, there are two types of qualifying chronic disabilities: (1) an undiagnosed illness, and (2) a medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (MUCMI). 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(2).

An undiagnosed illness is defined as a condition that by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to a known clinical diagnosis. There must also be objective indications of chronic disability, which include both "signs," in the medical sense of objective evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical indicators that are capable of independent verification. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(3).

A MUCMI is defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms, such as: (1) chronic fatigue syndrome, (2) fibromyalgia, and (3) functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural gastrointestinal disease). The term MUCMI means a diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology that is characterized by overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory abnormalities. Chronic multi symptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, will not be considered medically unexplained. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2).

On August 10, 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was enacted and amended the law such that it eliminated the manifestation period and the degree to which a qualifying chronic disability must manifest to be presumed as due to service in the Persian Gulf. See 38 U.S.C. § 1117. Thus, undiagnosed illness and MUCMIs may now manifest at any time and to any degree (including noncompensable). Therefore, there is no longer a requirement for a chronic disability to manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more prior to an end date (currently December 31, 2026), as stated in the regulation. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a).

In addition, the PACT Act established presumption of in-service exposure to burn pits and other toxins for veterans who served in certain parts of the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations after August 2, 1990. The PACT Act established presumption for numerous respiratory illnesses and cancers as due to in-service exposure to burn pits and other environmental hazards. The Veteran's claimed disabilities are not subject to presumptive service connection for exposure to burn pits and other toxins; thus, this expansion is not applicable under the facts of this case.

Finally, the PACT Act directs that in certain circumstances, when a veteran is found to have been involved in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during service, VA must obtain an opinion addressing whether such toxic exposure caused a diagnosed disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1168.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Factual Background & Analysis 

The Board incorporates the favorable finding made in the August 2024 rating decision that a March 2024 VA examination notes a diagnosis for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 

The Veteran's contention is that she has "gastrointestinal signs or symptoms" caused by an in-service event, injury or exposure. She stated that "my exposure to toxins has caused chronic pain and gastrointestinal problems. Chronic diarrhea, abdominal cramping and severe anxiety." See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not note any reports, related symptoms or diagnosis for GERD during active service. Private medical records from Atrium Health note a diagnosed for GERD with esophagitis. A November 2022 progress notes an acute complaint of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. 

VA gastrointestinal examinations were performed in March 2024. The Veteran was not diagnosed with any stomach/duodenal conditions but was diagnosed with GERD. The Veteran endorsed having GERD symptoms that "started as heartburn" in approximately 2014 to 2015. She endorsed symptoms of acid reflux, heartburn, nausea and vomiting when the condition first began. She also endorsed having current symptoms of dysphagia, constant acid reflux, regurgitation, nausea and vomiting. She was noted to be taking Omeprazole. 

Service records confirm that the Veteran served in Kuwait and Iraq. Therefore, the Veteran is considered to have engaged in toxic exposure risk activities (TERAs) based on the presumption of exposure to burn pits and other environmental hazards during her service in these specific locations. 38 U.S.C. § 1119.

Because the evidence confirms that the Veteran engaged in TERAs, a March 2024 VA TERA medical opinion was obtained to determine whether the current disability of GERD is causally related to the indicated TERAs. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a). The reviewing examiner opined that it is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the indicated TERAs after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The provided rationale was that GERD occurs due to relaxation of the (lower esophageal sphincter). Risk factors include obesity, hiatal hernia, pregnancy, scleroderma, delayed stomach emptying. Some lifestyle issues that may cause GERD include being overweight, overeating, having caffeine and alcohol, and eating chocolate and spicy foods. The examiner explained that there are causal risk factors for developing GERD such as diet that far outweigh the likelihood that her TERAs during service caused this disability. Ultimately, based on their review of the medical evidence and examination of the Veteran, they determined that there is no nexus between the current disability of GERD and the Veteran's service. The examiner included citation to online medical databases to support their conclusion.

The Board ultimately affords this opinion and the medical determination made therein significant probative weight. The underlying rationale for the negative nexus finding reflects consideration of pertinent medical records and contain reference to empirically proven medical knowledge regarding the known causes of GERD. Moreover, the examiner offered a clear conclusion with a reasoned medical explanation that was based on the available facts and the clinician's medical expertise. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A]medical opinion... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions"). Critically, there are no medical opinions of record from similarly qualified medical professionals to weigh against the conclusions made by this VA examiner. Consequently, this opinion constitutes the most probative medical evidence of record on the theory of direct service connection. It is also emphasized that the Veteran did not report having any gastrointestinal symptoms during her service and did not endorse having them until approximately 2014 to 2015. 

The Board has given due consideration to the Veteran's lay contentions regarding a causal relationship between any current gastrointestinal disabilities and her service. Lay testimony and opinions are not competent to provide the requisite cause of the diagnosed in this instance because this determination requires medical expertise and training which the appellant and his representative have not been shown to possess. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1); see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). As such, the Board finds that any lay contentions are outweighed by the more probative VA medical opinion discussed above. See King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012).

As a final consideration, presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 for an undiagnosed illness or MUCMI is also not warranted. The February March 2024 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with GERD, a disease with a clear and specific etiology and diagnosis. Additionally, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that GERD is categorically excluded from consideration as a MUCMI because it is considered a structural, as opposed to a functional gastrointestinal disease, which is not a qualifying MUCMI disease under the regulation for Persian Gulf War presumptive service connection diseases. As such, presumptive service connection for GERD due to Persian Gulf War service is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.

In sum, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's GERD is causally related to her service. Therefore, service connection is denied, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
