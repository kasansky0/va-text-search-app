DOCKET NO. 240123-410577
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

An effective date earlier than December 5, 2022, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.  

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's claim for TDIU was received on December 5, 2022, and it is not factually ascertainable that there was an increase in disability such that it rendered the Veteran unemployable during the year preceding that claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than December 5, 2022, for the award of TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1998 to June 1999 and from April 2003 to June 2004. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), also known as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In a May 2023 rating decision, TDIU was granted, effective December 5, 2022. In August 2023, the Veteran requested HLR of the effective date assigned to the grant of TDIU. A December 2023 HLR rating decision denied an earlier effective date. In a January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran appealed the December 2023 HLR rating decision to the Board and selected direct review. Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(f) (the evidentiary record in a HLR is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the AOJ issued notice of the prior decision under review). The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the May 2023 rating decision.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Effective Dates

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For an increase in disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, it is the date of receipt of the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). If the increase in disability occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the effective date for an increased rating is the date of receipt of the claim. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (noting the purpose of the one-year look back period in § 5110 is to provide veterans a one-year grace period for filing a claim following an increase in a service-connected disability and holding that "a veteran's claim for increased disability compensation must be filed within one year of an increase in the disability, as shown by the evidence, in order to obtain an effective date earlier than the date of the claim").

An award of TDIU for an already service-connected disability is considered an increase in disability compensation for purposes of assigning an effective date. Gaston, 605 F.3d at 981 (citing Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 32-34 (2007)). When entitlement to TDIU is raised during the adjudicatory process of a claim for an increased rating, it is part of the claim for benefits for the underlying disability. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 448 (2009). Because TDIU "is not its own separate benefit that VA can grant or deny unmoored from the underlying service-connection claim or rating," the "eventual effective date depends on the specific claim VA is then adjudicating." Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394, 401 (2024). Therefore, although TDIU may be raised in relation to multiple claim streams, the effective date of a TDIU is determined by the date of the underlying claim for the specific claim stream that is being adjudicated. Id. at 401-402. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 5, 2022, for the grant of TDIU

The Veteran's attorney asserts that an effective date of April 12, 2019, is warranted  for the grant of TDIU because that is when the Veteran became unemployable. In a January 2024 brief, the Veteran's attorney acknowledged that the Veteran's claim for TDIU was filed on December 5, 2022, but argued that "as the case law entails, this date is wholly irrelevant, and entitlement is to be established earlier." Citing Rice v. Shinseki, the Veteran's attorney asserted that an earlier effective date is warranted because entitlement arose earlier. Specifically, the Veteran's attorney indicated that "there was a plethora of evidence in the Veteran's claims file, dating back to 2020, where the Veteran was reported her symptoms were severely affecting her occupational capacity, to the point of compromising her overall quality of life." The Veteran's attorney further asserted that because the Veteran met the schedular criteria for TDIU in February 2018, and she has been unemployed since April 11, 2019, "the appropriate effective date for the award of TDIU is April 12, 2019, the later of two dates and the day after the Veteran became unemployed." 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than December 5, 2022, for the grant of TDIU is not warranted.

The Veteran's claim for TDIU was received on December 5, 2022. The Veteran has not asserted that she submitted a claim for TDIU prior to that date. Indeed, the Veteran's attorney has acknowledged that the Veteran's claim for TDIU was submitted to VA on December 5, 2022. Accordingly, the Veteran may be entitled to an effective date of up to a year prior to that date if it is factually ascertainable that there was an increase in disability such that it rendered the Veteran unemployable during the year preceding that claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Otherwise, it is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See id.

On the Veteran's December 2022 application for TDIU, she indicated that last worked full-time on April 11, 2019, at which time she became too disabled to work. Indeed, the Veteran's attorney asserts that the Veteran became unemployable on April 12, 2019, which is more than one year prior to the Veteran's claim for TDIU. As noted above, if the increase in disability occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the effective date for an increased rating is the date of receipt of the claim. See Gaston, 605 F.3d at 982. Accordingly, an effective date earlier than December 5, 2022, is not warranted based on an increase in disability during the year prior to the December 2022 claim. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's attorney's citation to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 448 (2009), which held that when entitlement to TDIU is raised during the adjudicatory process of a claim for an increased rating, it is part of the claim for benefits for the underlying disability. However, the Veteran's attorney has not identified any pending claim that was filed before December 5, 2022, in which a claim for TDIU has been raised. See id.; see also Phillips, 37 Vet. App. at 401-402. In a January 2024 brief, the Veteran's attorney cited to a January 2019 VA back examination report, which noted that the Veteran's back pain affected prolonged sitting, standing, repetitive motion, driving, pushing, pulling, climbing stairs, and walking. However, that examination report also indicated that the Veteran was working eight to ten hours a day. Therefore, the Board finds that a claim for TDIU was not reasonably raised by that VA examination report. Moreover, as will be discussed below, the initial rating assigned to the Veteran's back disability became final.

In a March 2019 rating decision, service connection was granted for intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS), right lower extremity radiculopathy, tinnitus, and bilateral hearing loss, all effective November 30, 2018. With respect to the initial rating assigned for tinnitus, the Veteran did not file a supplemental claim, a request for HLR, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the date the AOJ mailed notice of that decision. Therefore, the initial rating assigned for tinnitus became final. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1). The AOJ then requested a supplemental opinion regarding the initial rating assigned to the Veteran's back disability, and a subsequent March 2019 rating decision continued the initial rating assigned for IVDS. The Veteran did not file a supplemental claim, a request for HLR, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the date the AOJ mailed notice of that decision. Therefore, the initial rating assigned for IVDS became final. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1). In March 2020, the Veteran requested HLR of the initial ratings assigned for right lower extremity radiculopathy and bilateral hearing loss. In a July 2020 HLR rating decision, a 20 percent rating was granted for right lower extremity radiculopathy, effective November 30, 2018, and a compensable rating was denied for bilateral hearing loss. The Veteran did not file a supplemental claim or an appeal to the Board within one year of the date the AOJ mailed notice of that decision. Therefore, the initial ratings assigned for right lower extremity radiculopathy and bilateral hearing loss became final. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1). Accordingly, an earlier effective date is not warranted based on a claim for TDIU that was raised as part of a pending claim for a higher rating. See Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 448.  

The Board notes that after TDIU was granted, a July 2023 rating decision granted service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, and a 50 percent rating was assigned, effective March 21, 2018. However, the Veteran did not file a supplemental claim, a request for HLR, or an appeal to the Board with respect to the initial rating assigned for obstructive sleep apnea within one year of the date the AOJ mailed notice of that decision. Therefore, the initial rating assigned for obstructive sleep apnea became final. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1). Moreover, that claim is not part of the instant claim stream. See Phillips, 37 Vet. App. at 401-402. Accordingly, an earlier effective date for TDIU is not warranted based on that claim.  

Finally, the Board acknowledges the assertion of the Veteran's attorney that entitlement to TDIU arose on April 12, 2019. However, as noted above, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In this case, the Veteran's claim was not received until December 5, 2022. Therefore, even if entitlement arose on April 12, 2019, the proper effective date for the grant of TDIU is December 5, 2022, the later of the two dates.

In sum, the Veteran's claim for TDIU was received on December 5, 2022, and it is not factually ascertainable that there was an increase in disability such that it rendered the Veteran unemployable during the year preceding that claim. As the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against the claim, an effective date earlier than December 5, 2022, for the grant of TDIU is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 17, 2021).
