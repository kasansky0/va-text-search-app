ORDER

Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance is granted.

Entitlement to SMC based on housebound status is dismissed as moot. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the relevant period the Veteran was so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance due to his service-connected disabilities.

2. The Veteran's claim for SMC on account of being housebound is rendered moot by the Board's grant of SMC at the aid and attendance rate herein.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 3.352.

2. There are no further questions of fact or law remaining for appellate consideration regarding the Veteran's claim for SMC on account of being housebound. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114 (l), 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1970 to January 1972.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In August 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2022 decision.  In September 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2022 decision and identified a duty to assist error. Thereafter, the AOJ conducted additional development and the claim was readjudicated in a September 2023 rating decision.  

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance or homebound.  

The Veteran contends he is entitled to SMC due to his need for aid and attendance due to his service-connected disabilities. See March 2022 Claim. 

SMC is based on the need for aid and attendance and is payable when a Veteran, due to a service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet or one hand and one foot, or was blind in both eyes, or was permanently bedridden or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350.

To be deemed so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance, there must be at least one of the following: (1) an inability to dress or undress or to keep ordinarily clean and presentable independently; (2) frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without assistance; (3) an inability to feed independently through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; (4) an inability to attend to the wants of nature; or (5) incapacity, either physical or mental, that requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect from hazards or dangers incident in the daily environment. It is not required that all of these disabling conditions be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions which a Veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with their condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that the Veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need. Determinations that a Veteran is so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance are based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a).

Entitlement to SMC based on housebound status will be paid where a Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i). Where there is no single disability evaluated under the rating schedule as 100 percent disabling, a TDIU due to a single service-connected disability will qualify. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).

The Board finds that entitlement to special monthly compensation based on the need for regular aid and attendance is warranted.

The Veteran is service connected for the following disabilities: bilateral hearing loss (80 percent, effective December 28, 2020); right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy (40 percent, effective July 30, 2020); left lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy (40 percent, effective July 30, 2020); right upper extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy (20 percent, effective November 3, 2020); left upper extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy (30 percent, effective November 3, 2020); diabetes mellitus, type II (20 percent, effective March 24, 2016); tinnitus (10 percent, effective March 27, 2019); malaria vivax (non-compensable, effective January 31, 1973); and bilateral cataracts (non-compensable, effective March 24, 2016). 

The Veteran submitted a March 2022 Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance describing his need for daily assistance. The Veteran reported he needed assistance to feed himself, prepare his own meals, manage his medications, needs assistance bathing, and tending to other hygiene needs. See March 2022 Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his need for aid and attendance in October 2022. The examiner noted the Veteran's diabetic neuropathy caused pain and tingling in the Veteran's hands and feet. The examiner also noted it affected his ability to ambulate and required the Veteran to use a wheelchair. Further, the examiner noted the Veteran was unable to cook, clean, or complete activities of daily living independently. The examiner also noted the Veteran needed help managing his medications and being transported to doctor appointments. In September 2023, an addendum opinion was issued for the Veteran's aid and attendance examination. In the September 2023 addendum opinion, the examiner noted the Veteran was not in need of aid and attendance due to his diabetic neuropathy because the there were no medical records that showed the Veteran required aid and attendance. The Board notes the September 2023 addendum opinion was factually inadequate. Specifically, as detailed below, the Veteran's VA treatment records clearly indicate he required aid and attendance due to his diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 

In November 2020, the Veteran received a VA examination for his diabetic peripheral neuropathy which noted he had pain and numbness in his hands and feet which rendered him unable to do daily activities of living. The examiner noted the Veteran needed assistance cooking, cleaning, bathing, and changing. The Veteran's peripheral neuropathy also caused issued ambulating as the Veteran is unable to stand for more than five minutes and unable to hold anything in his right hand. See November 2020 VA Treatment Record. 

The Veteran's VA treatment records note the Veteran needed assistance with the activities of daily living due to his diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In February 2022, the Veteran's VA physician noted the Veteran had balance and gait issues which caused him to need a walker or cane to ambulate. The February 2022 records also noted he was unable to cook or clean, needed assistance with showering and walking, unable to feel his fingers, had no strength in his fingers or hands, and needed assistance eating due to inability to feel his fork or knife. 

An August 2022 VA treatment record also indicated the Veteran had a caregiver come to his home as he was unable to walk much, had a hard time getting out of bed due to pain, and was unable to open things due to pain in his hands. In an August 2023 VA treatment record indicated the Veteran had a live-in caregiver for about four years who helped with groceries, cooking, and cleaning. Based on the Veteran's treatment records, the Board finds he needs assistance in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a).

Therefore, entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance of another person under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

Finally, whether the Veteran is entitled to SMC at the housebound rate is moot, as SMC based on the need for aid and attendance of another person is the greater monetary benefit. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l), (s).
