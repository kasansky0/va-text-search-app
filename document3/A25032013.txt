DOCKET NO. 221014-285818
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

An effective date of December 2, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of a 70 percent rating for post-traumatic stress disorder with alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, major depressive disorder, and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression (herein all of which will be referred to collectively as "PTSD"), is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of December 2, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for tension headaches is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of December 2, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an April 2015 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for PTSD with an evaluation of 30 percent, effective October 8, 2014. The Veteran did not appeal that decision, nor was new and material evidence received within one year. Thus, the decision is final.

2. The next correspondence that can be considered a claim for an increased rating for PTSD was an intent to file (ITF) received on December 2, 2021. The formal claim was submitted in June 2022.

3. After resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his PTSD manifested in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas from December 2, 2021.

4. It is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms increased in severity during the one-year period prior to December 2, 2021.

5. The first correspondence that can be interpreted as a service connection claim for tension headaches and tinnitus was an ITF received by VA on December 2, 2021.

6. In October 2022, VA received a formal claim for service connection for tension headaches and tinnitus. It was the first claim received after the December 2, 2021 ITF.

7. The Veteran's claims for service connection for tension headaches and tinnitus were granted in a November 2022 rating decision, with an effective date of June 20, 2022.

8. After resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the Veteran's tension headaches and tinnitus first manifested no later than December 2, 2021.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of December 2, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of an increased rating of 70 percent for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110, 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.102, 3.400, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of December 2, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from March 2011 to April 2012.  This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2022 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The Veteran timely appealed, submitting the VA Form 10182 the next month and selecting the Direct Review docket. In the Direct Review docket, the Board reviews the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decision on appeal for each issue. Accordingly, no additional evidence after the September 2022 rating decision may be considered. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Effective Dates

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An initial claim includes a new claim requesting service connection and a claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, but only if the claim for an increase is received within one year from such date. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). 

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014). The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are: (1) intent to apply for benefits; (2) identification of the benefits sought; and (3) communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

From March 24, 2015, a claim must be filed on a designated VA form. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2018); 79 Fed. Reg. 57,696 (Sept. 25, 2014).

After March 24, 2015, aside from submitting a formal claim, a Veteran may file an intent to file a claim via a saved electronic application, written intent on a prescribed intent to file a claim form, or oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel and recorded in writing. If VA receives a complete application appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. If any communication indicating a desire for benefits is not completed by one of these three options, then such communication is considered a request for an application form for benefits and has no impact on effective dates, which is governed based upon when the formal claim is received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (2018).

Prior to February 19, 2019, a final claim is one in which the period to file a notice of disagreement has expired or there is a disposition on appellate review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d). A claimant must file a notice of disagreement within one year from the date that notice of the determination is mailed to him or her. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52. A decision will not become final if new and material evidence is submitted within one year of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

A rating decision is final and binding as to the conclusions based on the evidence on file at the time VA issues written notification. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(a). A final and binding AOJ decision will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). Where the evidence establishes such an error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended, and it will have the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the same date as the reversed or amended decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).

1. Entitlement to an effective date of December 2, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for tension headaches is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of December 2, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is granted.

3. An effective date of December 2, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD is granted.

The Veteran asserts, regarding his PTSD and tinnitus claims, that he should receive his respective awards (increased rating for PTSD and service connection for tinnitus) on the date he submitted his intent to file, on December 3, 2021. The Board agrees, although it notes that VA received his intent to file one day earlier on December 2, 2021, and thus will award that more favorable date to the Veteran. Regarding the tension headaches, he states that he was "diagnosed, but denied compensation in 2014," which the Board will address below.

To establish an effective date earlier than June 20, 2022 for the increased rating for PTSD and grants of service connection for tension headaches and tinnitus, the Veteran would need to show (1) that he had a prior claim of service connection for either of these disabilities that remained pending, and, if so, (2) that these disabilities first manifested prior to June 20, 2022. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Veteran may also obtain an effective date within the one-year look back period for his PTSD if it is factually ascertainable that such increase in disability had occurred within that one-year period. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Date of Claim

On November 25, 2014, the Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for PTSD. See November 2014 VA Forms 21-526EZ and 21-4138. In an April 2015 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD with an evaluation of 30 percent, effective October 8, 2014. Notice of that decision was issued in a notification letter that same day. The Veteran did not appeal that decision, nor was new and material evidence received within one year. Thus, the decision became final. 

After the April 2015 rating decision, the next correspondence that can be interpreted to be a claim of an increased rating for PTSD was received on December 2, 2021 in the form of an ITF. December 2, 2021 is also when a claim for service connection for tension headaches and tinnitus can be interpreted to be received via ITF, as well.

VA first received formal claims for service connection for tension headaches and migraines in June 2022. See VA Form 21-526EZ. The Veteran also submitted his increased rating claim for PTSD on that date and form as well. These were the first claims filed after the December 2, 2021 ITF submission and is therefore considered to have perfected the December 2, 2021 ITF.

In a September 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted and increased rating for the Veteran's PTSD to 70 percent and service connection for tension headaches and tinnitus and assigned an effective date of June 20, 2022 for all three claims, and the Veteran appealed the decision to the Board. 

Accordingly, as the June 2022 claim perfected the December 2, 2021 ITF, the correct date of claim for this matter is December 2, 2021.

In responding directly to the Veteran's assertion that he is entitled to an earlier effective date because he was diagnosed with tension headaches and denied compensation in 2014, that is not entirely the case. While the Board does agree that the Veteran at least had tension headaches as early as October 2014, there is no records of the Veteran filing a claim, informal or otherwise, regarding his tension headaches until December 2021 via an ITF. To the extent that the Veteran believes his October 2014 phone call to VA to state his intention to file a claim constituted a claim of some sort, this is erroneous. See October 2014 VA Form 21-0820. That phone call cannot qualify as an informal claim because it was not completed by the Veteran or his authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155 (2014). The VA personnel completed the Report of Contact, and is not an "informal claim" per 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155 (2014). Moreover, the VA mailed the appropriate claim form to the Veteran, which the Veteran completed and sent back, including a claim for PTSD, but failed to request his claim for tension headaches. See November 2014 VA Form 21-526EZ. Additionally, the Veteran submitted another form that same day providing further details regarding his individual claims and did not mention headaches on that form either. See November 2014 VA Form 21-4138. There is no rating decision denying headaches, as there was never a claim filed for headaches and thus no rating decision issued, until the September 2022 rating decision granting tension headaches, which is currently the subject of the instant appeal. It is not enough to have a diagnosis: the Veteran must submit a claim.

Date of Entitlement

The record contains a diagnosis of tension headaches in 2014, and the Veteran reports the onset of his tinnitus during his July 2022 VA examination as starting in 2012, of which, the Board finds him credible and competent to report; and after resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's tension headaches and tinnitus first manifested no later than December 2, 2021. Thus, the date of entitlement for this matter is no later than December 2, 2021. 

Because the date of entitlement is no later than the date of claim, an effective date of December 2, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for tension headaches and tinnitus is GRANTED.

Regarding PTSD, the Board must now determine the date at which the Veteran is entitled to a 70 percent rating for his PTSD. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Veteran's PTSD is rated under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula). A 30 percent rating is warranted where the disorder is manifested by occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, and mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events).

A 50 percent rating is warranted where the disorder is manifested by occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when the psychiatric condition produces occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

Due to the close, temporal proximity of the December 2021 ITF and July 2022 VA examination that was used as the basis of the 70 percent rating, and in affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD first manifested to the severity level of a 70 percent rating no later than December 2, 2021.

Because the date of entitlement is no later than the date of claim, an effective date of December 2, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of 70 percent for the Veteran's PTSD is GRANTED.

One-Year Lookback

Because the PTSD matter stems from a claim for an increased rating, the Board must determine whether it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran's PTSD worsened in the one-year period prior to the December 2, 2021 Intent to File.

The Board finds that it is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's disability worsened in the one-year period prior to December 2, 2021. Significantly, there are no VA treatment records, private treatment records, nor lay statements submitted during this period and thus there is no indication, either in medical evidence or lay evidence, that the Veteran's symptoms increased during the one-year period prior to December 2, 2021 such that it can be factually ascertainable. As a result, the assignment of an effective date within the one-year period prior to December 2, 2021 must be denied.
