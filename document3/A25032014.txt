ORDER

The appeal as to entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 7, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in this appeal, the Board rendered a decision addressing the same underlying rating decision and relevant facts.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal seeking service connection for a cervical spine disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1989 to February 1997. 

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105.

In VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) filed November 1, 2023, the Veteran requested review of a December 2022 rating decision. However, in January 2023, the Veteran had submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, in which he requested review of the December 2022 rating decision. In April 2023, a duty to assist error had been identified during the higher-level review requiring further development. Upon completion of the additional development, the RO issued another decision in October 2023, which continued the denial on the issue of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability. In VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) filed November 29, 2023, the Veteran requested review of the October 2023 rating decision. In a March 7, 2025 decision (Docket No. 231129-397726), the Board reviewed the October 2023 rating decision and determined that additional development was warranted. 

Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
