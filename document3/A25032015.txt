DOCKET NO. 210922-187093
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal seeking increased ratings for the service-connected right and left knee conditions is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran requested that his appeal be withdrawn; there are no questions of fact or law in the matter remaining for the Board to consider.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal seeking increased ratings for the service-connected right and left knee conditions have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 15, 1970 to July 14, 1973. The Veteran also had service from July 15, 1973 to September 27, 1976 which was under other than honorable conditions and is a bar to VA benefits.

In the September 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On March 26, 2025, the Veteran, through his representative, withdrew the hearing request.

The appeal seeking increased ratings for the service-connected right and left knee conditions is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Except for appeals withdrawn on the record at hearings, the withdrawal must be in writing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In March 2025, the Veteran, through his attorney, submitted a written statement, which included the Veteran's name, claims file number, and docket number of this appeal, indicating that the Veteran wished to withdraw all issues in this appeal before the Board. As the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 20.205, there remains no allegations of errors of fact or law for the Board to address.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
