REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) emergency medical services provided by the City of Norfolk on April 16, 2020, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1989 to July 1995.  Unfortunately, the Veteran passed away in December 2021.  The Appellant is the provider that provided the Veteran with the ambulance transport on April 16, 2020.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2020 determination from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

In March 2021, the Appellant disagreed with the above-noted decision and filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)).  The Appellant selected the Direct Review Lane by submitting notice of disagreement under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d).  Accordingly, the Board is limited to review of the evidence in the record up and until the date of the notice for the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the above claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300. 

Remand

At issue in this matter is entitlement to payment or reimbursement of the cost of ambulance transportation services provided to the Veteran on April 16, 2020. Unfortunately, all records related to the claim have not been obtained and made available for review by the Board.  Rather, the record contains an Explanation of Payment (EOP) sent to the Appellant noting billed charges of $800.00 and payment of $0.00 due to a finding that the insufficient medical records had been received as part of the claim.

The record also contains a medical receipt for the Veteran's ambulance ride on April 16, 2020.  These notes do not, however, contain any information regarding the nature of the Veteran's ambulance transport, to include whether that transport was to a VA or a VA-authorized facility.

In this regard, the Board notes that generally, VA beneficiary travel is a payment for travel expenses incurred in the United States to help Veterans and other persons obtain care or services from the Veterans Health Administration.  38 U.S.C. § 111; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10.  A veteran is eligible for beneficiary travel payments for travel to or from a VA facility or VA-authorized health care facility for the following: (1) treatment for a service-connected disability, regardless of the disability rating; (2) treatment for any disability, provided that the Veteran has a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more; (3) a scheduled compensation and pension examination; (4) if the Veteran receives pension under 38 U.S.C. § 1521; (5) if the Veteran's annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension that the Veteran would receive under 38 U.S.C. § 1521; or, (6) if, the Veteran is unable to defray the expenses of that travel under certain circumstances.  38 U.S.C. § 111; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a).

Given the basis of the AOJ's denial of the claim, it does not appear that the AOJ considered the claim under 38 U.S.C. § 111, which leads the Board to believe that the April 16, 2020, transport was not to a VA or VA-authorized facility.  Indeed, it would appear that the AOJ denied the claim under 38 U.S.C. § 1703.  However, given the lack of records pertaining to the April 16, 2020, transport, and the lack of information regarding whether the Veteran's annual income falls below the maximum annual rate of pension under 38 U.S.C. § 1521, the Board cannot be sure under what authority the claim should be adjudicated.   

Additionally, the Board notes, VA beneficiary travel rules explicitly do "not cover payment for emergency transportation of veterans for non-service-connected conditions in non-VA facilities when the payment for transportation is covered by §§ 17.1000 through 17.1008, as authorized by 38 U.S.C. § 1725."  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000-17.1008 ; 70.1.   However, there is no indication that the AOJ adjudicated the Veteran's claim for payment or reimbursement of the cost of the ambulance transport under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000 through 17.1008.  

Ultimately, the Board finds that remand is warranted in order to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Specifically, the AOJ failure to obtain and associate with the claims file all records related to the April 16, 2020, ambulance transport, to include records from the treating and receiving facilities, is a pre-decisional duty to assist error that necessitates remand for correction.  On remand, the AOJ must obtain and associate all pertinent documents and records pertaining to the claim on appeal with the Veteran's electronic claims file.  This includes, but is not limited to, all pertinent medical records from the date of service on appeal, all medical bills or invoices generated for the dates of service in question, and all documentation showing that the Veteran is financially liable for the costs associated with the April 16, 2020, ambulance transport.  The Board points out that due process requires that the AOJ ensures that the record before it is made available for the Board's review in connection with the appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (requiring the Secretary to consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate records related to the claim for payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred for ambulance transport on April 16, 2020, with the electronic claims file, including all pertinent medical records from the date of service at the facilities where the Veteran was transported to and from; any records from the City of Norfolk regarding transport of the Veteran on April 16, 2020; all medical bills or invoices generated for the dates of service in question; and all documentation showing that the Veteran was financially liable for the costs associated with the April 16, 2020, ambulance transport.

2. Determine whether the April 16, 2020, transport should be considered transport to a VA or VA-authorized facility.  A determination to this effect should be noted in writing and associated with the Veteran's claims file.

3. Adjudicate in the first instance whether the Veteran was entitled to VA beneficiary travel benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 111; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a).

4. If the Veteran was not entitled to beneficiary travel benefits, consider the appeal under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and the accompanying regulations, particularly 38 C.F.R. § 17.1003.  In conjunction with this consideration, review the records from the City of Norfolk concerning the ambulance transportation of the Veteran on April 16, 2020.

Adjudicate the claim for payment or reimbursement of the cost of the ambulance transportation under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000-17.1008, including the underlying eligibility criteria for such payment or reimbursement found at 38 C.F.R. § 17.1003.  If this adjudication results in a denial of payment or reimbursement, ensure that the decision issued to the Appellant complies with the notice requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 5104.
