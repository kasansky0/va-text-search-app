ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the left shoulder disability is at least as likely as not related to in-service injuries.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the right shoulder disability is at least as likely as not related to in-service injuries.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a left shoulder disability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for a right shoulder disability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 2009 to December 2015, with additional periods of service in the Army Reserve from December 2015 to October 2017. He received the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with 2 Campaign Stars, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and Army Commendation Medal, among other awards and decorations. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 decision of the VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The October 2023 decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized appellate review system, known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) applies.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Based on the Veteran's selection of the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

Absent clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings. In the October 2023 decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate these claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board finds that there is no clear and unmistakable error in that findings and will proceed directly to readjudicate the underlying claims.

Considering the various diagnoses of record for the Veteran's shoulders, and to encompass all disorders that are reasonably raised by the record, the Board has recharacterized the claims of service connection for left and right shoulder strain as claims for left and right shoulder disabilities. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability.

The Veteran seeks service connection for left and right shoulder disabilities, which he asserts began in service due to in-service injuries from his training and duties, including parachute landing falls. See August 2021 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim; August 2023 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). 

Establishing service connection on a direct basis generally requires competent and credible evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a "nexus," between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). 

Initially, the AOJ has conceded the Veteran has left and right shoulder disabilities.    Therefore, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's shoulder disabilities are at least as likely as not etiologically related to an in-service disease, injury, or event.

As to an in-service disease, injury, or event, the Veteran has reported in-service injuries, including from physical training exercises, carrying heavy loads, and parachute landing falls. See August 2023 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. Although the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for complaints or treatment for shoulder injuries, he has consistently stated he sought treatment during service and was then prescribed over-the-counter medication and rest. See September 2021, March 2022, and July 2023 VA examinations. The Veteran has also described his shoulder injuries as co-occurring with other claimed service injuries, like his low back, knee, and hip. See, e.g., March 2022 and July 2023 VA examinations. The AOJ has conceded in-service injuries in the Veteran's pursuit of these other musculoskeletal claims due to his military occupational specialty as an infantryman and his completion of airborne training school. See May 2023 rating decision. The Veteran's available service records confirm these details. See STRs. Accordingly, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds sufficient evidence supporting in-service injuries related to the Veteran's shoulders. 

As to a nexus between his in-service injuries and his current shoulder disabilities, the Veteran stated he has self-managed his shoulder disabilities post-service with ice, heat, a shoulder compression brace, and over-the-counter medications as advised in service. See August 2023 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. The Veteran is competent to relay his subjective experience of symptoms and self-treatment for his shoulder disabilities both during and after service, and the Board finds his statements are credible and entitled to probative and persuasive weight. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995). 

In accordance with its duty to assist, the AOJ has provided the Veteran with VA examinations and opinions for these claims. However, none of the requested opinions consider whether the Veteran's shoulder disabilities are directly related to his described in-service injuries. See September 2021 opinion (regarding medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness of unknown etiology) and September 2023 opinions (regarding toxic exposure risk activity). As these opinions are not responsive to the Veteran's raised theory of service connection, the opinions are inadequate. El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-41 (2013) (holding that a medical opinion that applies the incorrect legal standard is inadequate). 

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted private medical nexus opinions for these claims. The private examiner noted review of the claims file, including the lay evidence, and opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's shoulder disabilities are attributable to, or a continuation of, his in-service shoulder injuries. The examiner bolstered these opinions with medical literature documenting that a prior shoulder injury, in combination with repetitive force and overuse, can lead to chronic shoulder strain and reinjury. The Boards finds the private medical nexus opinions are sufficient for adjudication and entitled to probative value. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-04 (2008).

The Board can remand these claims for adequate VA nexus opinions regarding direct service connection but finds the lay evidence and private medical opinions are sufficient to decide the claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c). Moreover, because the Board is granting service connection, the maximum benefit sought in this claim, a remand is not required. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Based on the foregoing, and resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the probative and persuasive evidence supports that the Veteran's left and right shoulder disabilities are related to his service. Accordingly, service connection is warranted, and the appeals are granted.
