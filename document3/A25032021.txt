REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rating decisions on appeal was issued in July 2021, September 2021, and November 2021 under The Veterans Appeals Improvement Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA) review system.  

In July 2022, the Veteran timely appealed the rating decisions to the Board and selected the evidence submission lane for this appeal.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant her representative with the VA Form 10182 or within 90 days of receipt of the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

Withdrawal

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant.  Except for appeals withdrawn on the record at a hearing, appeal withdrawals must be in writing and meet certain requirements set forth by regulation.  They must include the name of the appellant, the applicable file number, and a statement that the appeal is being withdrawn.  Id; see also Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).

In March 2025, the Veteran expressed her desire to withdraw her appeal as to the above-mentioned claims.  See March 2025 Correspondence.  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the March 2025 withdrawal, indicating the Veteran's name, file number, and intention to withdraw her appeal, satisfies the requirements for the withdrawal as to the above-mentioned claims.  See Hembree, 33 Vet. App. at 6.

Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran has withdrawn her appeal as to the above-mentioned claims and there remains no allegation of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and the claims are dismissed.
