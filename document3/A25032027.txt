ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the appellant's current right ear hearing loss is related to acoustic trauma injury sustained during active duty for training (ADT) and inactive duty for training (IDT).

2.  The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the appellant's current tinnitus is related to acoustic trauma injury sustained during ADT and IDT service periods.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the appellant, the criteria for service connection for right ear hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6, 3.102, 3.303.

2.  With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the appellant, the criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6, 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant served on ADT in the United States Army from January 1989 to April 1989 and had additional IDT service in the Army National Guard from November 1988 to November 1992.

This case was docketed by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) based on a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), filed by the appellant on July 25, 2024.  In the NOD, the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  He identified the appealed issues as entitlement to service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus from a July 19, 2024 rating decision.  

As the benefits sought are being granted in full, discussion of the period for switching dockets is unnecessary.  Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

The appealed July 2024 rating decision confirmed and continued the previous denials for service connection for right ear hearing loss and tinnitus.  It found that new and relevant evidence had been received for each disability, and these determinations are binding upon the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The July 2024 rating decision is linked to an April 2023 request for Higher-Level Review (HLR).  In July 2023, the HLR adjudicator determined that additional development was needed for these claims and returned these issues for adjudication after completion of the requested development.  

As to the evidentiary period, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the July 2024 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

As relevant, the term "active military, naval, air, or space service" includes any period of active duty, ADT during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty and any period of IDT during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or cerebrovascular accident which occurred during such training.  38 U.S.C. § 101(24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a).  Accordingly, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred while performing ADT and for disability resulting from injury or the specified cardiac or cerebrovascular events incurred while performing IDT.  Id.  VA's Office of General Counsel has defined "injury" as harm resulting from an external trauma, while "disease" is defined as some type of internal infection or degenerative process. VAOPGCPREC 04-2002 (May 14, 2002).

ADT is defined, in part, as "full-time duty in the Armed Forces performed by reserves for training purposes."  38 U.S.C. § 101(22); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(c).  The term IDT is defined, in part, as duty, other than full-time duty, under sections 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 of the title 32 [U. S. Code] or the prior corresponding provisions of law.  38 U.S.C. § 101(23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(d).

While service on active duty alone is sufficient to meet the statutory definition of veteran, service on ADT (or IDT) without more, will not suffice to give one "veteran" status.  Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 172 (2010).  Before veteran status can be established for a period of such service, it must first be established that a claimant was disabled from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty during ADT, or that he or she was disabled from an injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty during IDT.

In this case, there is no report that the appellant ever had any active duty service period.  Service department records confirm an ADT service period from January 1989 to April 1989 and additional Army National Guard service from November 1988 to November 1992.  The Board has considered the appellant and K.D.'s reports about the dates of service.  See March 2023 and July 2024 correspondences.  They assert that the appellant's service period was from 1988 to 1992 and this time period should be under consideration for these claims.  Their assertions are noted and correspond to service department records verifying Army National Guard service from November 1988 to November 1992.  However, without corroboration from service department records or assertions of outstanding service department records, their reports are not probative to show any period of active duty service.  With this background, the Board finds that active duty service is not shown.  38 U.S.C. § 101(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(d); Id.

Since the appellant does not have active duty service, the provisions for hearing loss and tinnitus as a chronic disease are inapplicable to the instant case.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101(2), (21), (22), (23), and (24), 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(d), 3.6, 3.307(a)(1); see also Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 47 (2010).

Additional laws and regulations apply specifically to the right ear hearing loss claim.  The laws and regulations do not require in-service complaints of or treatment for hearing loss in order to establish service connection, nor does normal hearing shown on audiometric testing at separation bar service connection.  See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  Instead, evidence of a current hearing loss disability (i.e., one meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385) and a medically sound basis for attributing such disability to service may serve as a basis for a grant of service connection for hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993).  The Court's holding in Hensley is consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d), which provides that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For VA compensation purposes, impaired hearing is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory threshold for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hertz is 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  When audiometric test results at separation from service do not meet the regulatory requirements for establishing a "disability" at that time, a claimant may nevertheless establish service connection for a current hearing disability by submitting evidence that the current disability is related to service.  Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 160.  The threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels.  Id. at 157.

Right ear hearing loss and tinnitus

The Board will address these claims together because of the common background.

STRs showed that the appellant had an audiogram as part of his November 1988 enlistment examination with the following hearing acuity in decibel (db) results at the listed frequencies in Hertz (Hz).  

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	5	5	10	5	10

LEFT	0	0	10	10	5

Service personnel records reflect that the appellant's military occupational specialty (MOS) was Combat Engineer.  

In his November 2022 claim, the appellant stated that he had hearing loss and tinnitus due to his MOS duties as a combat engineer, specifically citing acoustic trauma from explosives and construction activity.

In December 2022, the appellant had a VA-contract hearing loss examination with an audiologist.  The audiologist noted that the appellant had a high probability of hazardous noise exposure through his Combat Engineer MOS.  Additionally, the appellant detailed loud military noise exposure from working as a hot missile loader and near small arms fire, mine field explosions, M-16, Humvees, tanks, track vehicle, claymores and grenades.  The audiologist noted the November 1988 audiometer results.  Audiometric evaluation confirmed right ear hearing loss for VA compensation purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Right ear tympanometry findings were normal for acoustic immittance, but abnormal for ipsilateral acoustic reflexes.  The audiologist reported being unable to obtain/ maintain a seal.  She diagnosed right ear conductive hearing loss.

The audiologist furnished a negative medical opinion.  She noted the appellant's history of military noise exposures and how noise exposure can lead to a temporary or permanent shift in hearing thresholds by causing the inner ear tissues to stretch beyond their elastic limits, which disrupts the stereocilia's mechanical function and damages supporting and sensory cells.  The disruption may result in immediate and permanent hearing loss.  Also, long term exposure to low level sounds may result in either temporary or permanent shifts in hearing thresholds.  However, in this case, there was no complaint or treatment for hearing decreases in STRs or at separation.  STRs did not show complaint or treatment for hearing decreases or at separation.  Although noise exposure was conceded and there was a well-established relationship of noise, auditory damage and hearing loss, auditory damage and hearing loss was not conceded based on noise exposure alone.  

In the remarks section, the audiologist summarized that the appellant reported loud military noise exposures and also post military noise exposure of heavy machinery with hearing protection.  Specifically, the appellant cited using forklifts at work.  The audiologist noted that the appellant had four months of ADT service from January 1989 to April 1989.  She advised the appellant to seek further evaluation for asymmetric hearing loss.  She explained that asymmetric hearing loss could be the symptom of retrocochlear pathology and have serious infectious complications.  

In December 2022, the appellant also had a VA-contract tinnitus examination with the audiologist.  The appellant reported experiencing an onset of tinnitus in 1990.  The initial onset was spontaneous.  It was constant and affected both ears.  It had not progressed since onset.  The audiologist issued a negative medical opinion.  She acknowledged loud noise exposure during service and a relationship between noise exposure and hearing loss.  However, there was no permanent shift in hearing thresholds beyond test variability from entrance to separation or report of decreased hearing in STRs or at separation.  Tinnitus may occur following a single exposure to high-intensity impulse noise, long term exposure to repetitive impulses, long term exposure to continuous noise or a combination of impulses and continuous noise.  Although the appellant's MOS had a moderate probability of noise exposure and noise exposure was known to cause tinnitus, the appellant first noticed tinnitus over one year after separation.  

In March 2023, the appellant's spouse stated that she married the appellant in May 1991 and that the appellant had experienced tinnitus for the entirety of their marriage and beforehand.  

For the following reasons, service connection for right ear hearing loss and tinnitus is warranted.

In-service noise exposure is conceded based upon the appellant's MOS as a combat engineer and his reports of military noise exposure.  The Board characterizes the reported in-service noise exposure as an acoustic trauma injury incurred during ADT and IDT.  38 C.F.R. § 3.6; VAOPGCPREC 04-2002 (May 14, 2002).

The December 2022 VA-contract hearing loss examination report confirms right ear hearing loss for VA compensation purposes and tinnitus.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  A current hearing loss disability is shown for the right ear and a current disability is shown for tinnitus.

The disputed issue is whether there is a relationship to ADT noise exposure manifesting as an acoustic trauma injury or disease or IDT noise exposure manifesting as an acoustic trauma injury for the disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.6.

The appellant is competent to report about his hearing impairment and tinnitus history as well as the circumstances of his service.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  He is not competent provide evidence about any medical issue that extends beyond a readily observable cause and effect type relationship.  See id.  He contends that his current right ear hearing loss and tinnitus is related to acoustic trauma injury sustained during ADT and IDT periods.  Although his assertions standing alone are not competent, the comments from the December 2022 VA-contract audiologist provide some medical support to his contentions.  The audiologist's comments acknowledge a clear relationship between acoustic trauma and hearing loss and tinnitus.  The appellant reports tinnitus symptoms appeared shortly after ADT.  This report provides a supporting cause and effect type chronology for auditory damage from ADT and IDT acoustic trauma.  It is reasonable to construe the report of tinnitus symptoms appearing in 1990 as the beginning of his hearing impairment symptoms later diagnosed as right ear hearing loss.  Thus, there is some competent evidence relating right ear hearing loss and tinnitus to acoustic trauma injury from ADT and IDT noise exposures as a combat engineer.     

The December 2022 VA-contract medical opinion weighs against a relationship for both disabilities.  However, the rationales for these medical opinions are limited.  The rationales do not clearly explain why ADT or IDT acoustic trauma is not a cause, include some favorable comments for the claims, and misstate the available STRs for review.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  The audiologist does not identify any possible alternative cause for right ear hearing loss or provide clear explanation as to why the appellant's report of tinnitus in 1990 would be unrelated to military acoustic trauma.  She concedes military noise exposure and a clear relationship between noise exposure and hearing loss and tinnitus.  Her comments about the medical literature appear to support the claim given the short time lapse between ADT noise exposure, continuing intermittent IDT noise exposure, and tinnitus onset.  Then, the audiologist cites the lack of significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds from entrance to separation.  The STR audiogram is limited to the entrance audiogram and there is no other STR audiogram for comparison.  With these limitations, the Board places less probative weight to the negative determinations from the December 2022 VA-contract medical opinions.  Id.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that a relationship to service for right hearing loss and tinnitus is approximately evenly balanced.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the appellant, who has gained veteran status based on this decision, entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss and tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
