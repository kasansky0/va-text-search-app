ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition is granted.  

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition is granted.  

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his left and right knee conditions (bilateral knee condition) had an onset in service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1974 to June 1980.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The Veteran selected the direct review docket in his July 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD) to the Board.  As such, evidence up until the date of the rating decision on appeal will be considered.  

The Board notes that in the March 2024 rating decision, the RO found that new and relevant evidence was submitted to warrant re-adjudicating the claim of service connection for a bilateral knee condition; the Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition.  

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition.  

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The evidence must show (1) the existence of a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1991). 

In this case, an April 2023 VA examination shows the Veteran has a diagnosis of knee strain in both knees/bilateral knees.  As such, a current disability has been shown regarding his bilateral knees.  Regarding an in-service incident, the Veteran contends that he injured his knees during service in August 1976 when he was rushing and fell down a full flight of stairs during a bomb threat.  He estimated he fell approximately 8-10 feet.  Service treatment records (STRs) from August 1976 indicate the Veteran reported injuring his knees when he fell down the stairs.  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the first two prongs regarding a current disability and in-service incurrence/injury have been met.  

Regarding nexus, a May 2023 VA medical opinion found that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's left and right knee conditions had an onset in service.  The examiner explained that, as noted above, the Veteran's injury was noted in his STRs, he had no issues in his knees prior to service and concluded that there is evidence of chronicity as an "injury to the knees as sustained by the confirmed incident on 08/18/1976 can result in lasting damage to knee joints."  

Furthermore, private medical evidence submitted in November 2023 indicated that x-rays showed evidence of an old injury in the Veteran's left tibia and fibula.  Moreover, during the course of the appeal, the Veteran has consistently asserted that his bilateral knee symptoms had an onset in service and have been persistent ever since.  These statements are competent, and there is no evidence that they are not credible.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  They are entitled to significant probative weight as to the onset of the Veteran's bilateral knee condition and associated symptoms in service and the continuity since service.  

The Board assigns little probative weight to the negative VA opinions of record, as the examiners appeared to dismiss the Veteran's lay statements regarding the continuity of his symptoms since the noted incidents in service and appeared to base the negative opinions on a lack of surgical correction as treatment and lack of contemporaneous documented treatment since service, which appellate courts have held cannot be the sole basis for a negative nexus opinion.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 12 Vet. App. 23 (2007); see also Buchannan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Thus, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise that the Veteran's bilateral knee condition had its onset in service and has been continuous since.  Service connection for a bilateral knee condition is granted.
