DOCKET NO. 240610-446487
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to May 31, 2022, for an increase rating of 10 percent for a bilateral hearing loss disability is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the pendency of the appeal steaming from the Veteran's May 31, 2022, claim, no medical evidence was received within the one-year look-back period that would warrant an earlier effective date.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to May 31, 2022, for the award continuing with an evaluation of 10 percent for a bilateral hearing loss disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from February 1960 to August 1960 and from October 1961 to August 1962. 

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The May 2024 rating decision was issued in response to a May 2024 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: 

The Veteran timely appealed by submitting a June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record that the AOJ was permitted to consider at the time it issued the May 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the May 2024 rating decision cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As the Board is adjudicating the claims herein, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim by submitting a VA form 20-0995 and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a VA form 20-0995 are included with this decision.

EARLIER EFFECTIVE DATES

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. With respect to claims to reopen, the effective date for an award of benefits will be the date of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r). The effective date for increased rating claims will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim for increase. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). In other words, if the increase occurred within the one year prior to the date of the claim for increase, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of the claim. If the increase occurred after the date of the claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)(2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998).

In the AMA, a claim may be continuously pursued by timely and properly filing an appeal to the Board or a review option before the AOJ after the issuance of an AOJ decision, Board decision, or decision by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). An appeal to the Board or a review option before the AOJ is timely if it is received by VA within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a). It is properly filed when it is on the form prescribed by the Secretary for that specific claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).

More specifically, following an AOJ decision on an initial or supplemental claim, the claimant may continuously pursue that claim by seeking review of that decision by the AOJ by filing a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, or a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), or appeal that decision to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1). When a claim has been continuously pursued, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151.

Presently, a "claim" is defined as a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). A claim for VA compensation must be submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. See 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151(a).

Relevant Procedural Highlights

A review of the claims file shows that in a February 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability with an evaluation of zero percent effective December 3, 2020. He did not appeal that rating decision to the Board nor seek review of that decision by the AOJ. 

Thereafter, the Veteran submitted an October 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking an increased rating for his bilateral hearing loss disability. In response, the AOJ issued a November 2021 rating decision continuing with an evaluation of zero percent for the bilateral hearing loss disability. Again, the Veteran did not appeal that rating decision to the Board nor seek review of that decision by the AOJ. 

In May 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking an increased rating for his bilateral hearing loss disability. In response, the AOJ issued a June 2022 rating decision continuing the zero percent evaluation for the bilateral hearing loss disability. The Veteran then submitted a March 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, seeking review of the June 2022 rating decision. In response, the AOJ issued an April 2023 rating decision continuing the zero percent evaluation for the bilateral hearing loss disability. The Veteran then submitted an April 2024 VA Form 20-0996, seeking a Higher-Level Review of the April 2023 rating decision. In response, the AOJ issued an April 2024 rating decision granting an increased evaluation of 10 percent for the bilateral hearing loss disability effective May 31, 2022, the date the May 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ was received by VA. Next, the Veteran submitted a May 2024 VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, seeking review of the effective date assigned for the 10 percent rating in the April 2024 rating decision. In response, the AOJ issued the May 2024 rating decision on appeal. In the May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ did not address the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of the 10 percent rating for his bilateral hearing loss disability. Rather, the AOJ denied an increased rating in excess of 10 percent. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 31, 2022, for an increase rating of 10 percent for a bilateral hearing loss disability. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date of December 3, 2020, for the award of the 10 percent rating for his bilateral hearing loss disability. See June 2024 Notice of Disagreement. 

Upon review of the relevant evidence, the Board determines that an effective date earlier than May 31, 2022, for the award of the 10 percent rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is not warranted. 

The effective date of May 31, 2022, is based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's new claim for an increased rating. See May 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. An earlier effective date can only be assigned if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred during the one year prior to VA's receipt of the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).   

Here, no medical evidence was received within the one-year look-back period that would warrant an earlier effective date prior to May 31, 2022.

The one-year look-back period includes a September 23, 2021, private medical treatment record (received by VA May 2022 and October 2021). This record shows that the Veterans bilateral hearing loss disability began to worsen in October 2020, outside of the one-year period.

A November 2021 VA hearing loss examination was also provided during the one-year lookback period. The Veteran's puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows: 

	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Average

RIGHT	40 dB	45 dB	65 dB	70 dB	55 dB

LEFT	20 dB	35 dB	50 dB	55 dB	40 dB

Maryland CNC speech discrimination scores were 84 percent in the right ear and 96 percent in the left ear. 

Utilizing Table VI, the combination of the 55 puretone threshold average and the 84 percent speech discrimination for the right ear results in the designation of a Roman numeral II. The combination of the 40 dB puretone threshold average and the 96 percent speech discrimination for the left ear results in the designation of a Roman numeral I. When the Roman numerals II and I are applied to Table VII, the resulting percentage evaluation is 0 percent, a noncompensable rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100.

Accordingly, the Board finds that there is no medical evidence of record indicative of a worsening of symptoms within the one-year period prior to VA's receipt of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating on May 31, 2022. Thus, there is no factual basis to award an earlier effective date prior to the date of the Veteran's claim. See Gaston, 605 F.3d at 984. 

The Board further notes that, once a decision establishing an effective date becomes final, the decision cannot be challenged through a freestanding claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date. See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006) (holding that a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date vitiates the rule of finality). In other words, if the claimant disagrees with the effective date assigned in a given rating action, it must be timely appealed; if not, an earlier effective date is available only if the claimant pleads clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in such rating action. A claim for CUE entails special pleadings and proof requirements to overcome the finality of the decision by collateral attack because the decision was not appealed during the appeal period. Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40 at 44 (1993); Duran v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 216, 223 (1994). 

As to the Veteran's contention that he is entitled to an effective date of December 3, 2020, for the award of the 10 percent rating for his bilateral hearing loss disability, such is impermissible as an attempt to file a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296. Since the Veteran did not file an appeal to the Board or seek review of the initial assigment of the 0 percent rating for his bilateral hearing loss disability in the February 2021 rating decision within one year of its issuance, a claim for an increased rating has not been continuously pursued since that time. Therefore, the February 2021 rating decision is final as to the effective date assigned for the service-connected bilateral hearing loss disability. 

Likewise, the Veteran did not initiate an appeal to the Board or seek review by the AOJ following the November 2021 rating decision. Although he submitted the May 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ within one year of the issuance of the November 2021 rating decision, the submission of a VA Form 21-526EZ neither initiates an appeal to the Board or a review by the AOJ. Rather, it initiates a new claim based on the disability worsening since the last rating assigned. See Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277, 292 (2024) (en banc) (stating that "when Congress created effective dates, it differentiated supplemental claims from increased compensation claims-cutting against them being the same"). Therefore, a VA Form 21-526EZ is not among the options available under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1) to establish continuous pursuit of a claim. For the same reasons, the Veteran's submission of the May 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ within one year of the November 2021 rating decision cannot establish continuous pursuit of a claim. Thus, an effective date commensurate with VA's receipt of the October 2021 VA Form 21-526EZs is also not permissible. 

Considering the above, the claim for an effective date earlier than May 31, 2022, for the award of the 10 percent rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is not warranted.
