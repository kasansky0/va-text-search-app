REMANDED

Service connection for right wrist osteonecrosis with arthritis secondary to left ankle fracture residuals is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran honorably served in the U.S. Air Force from September 1981 to March 1988, and in the U.S. Army from November 1988 to March 1994.  

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from September 2021 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rating decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of [list claims], any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Right wrist osteonecrosis 

The Veteran contends his right wrist disability is related to his left ankle disability because his weakened ankle causes falls which injure or aggravate his wrist.  His attorney argues the September 2022 VA examination is inadequate. 

Remand is required to correct a predecisional duty to assist error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.   

When the Secretary provides a veteran with a VA medical examination or opinion, it must be adequate.  A medical opinion is adequate when it is based upon consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and describes the disability in detail sufficient for the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability to be fully informed.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); See also Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007). 

A medical opinion must support its conclusion with an analysis the Board can weigh, and a mere conclusion by a medical professional is insufficient to allow the Board to make an informed decision.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007).  A secondary service connection medical opinion may be inadequate when it does not address aggravation.  See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-41 (2013).  

"An opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value." Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).

Here, examiner's opinion is inadequate for adjudicatory purposes.  

First, the examiner's opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise.  In the September 2022 VA disability benefits questionnaire, the examiner concluded the Veteran's right wrist disability was less likely than not related to his left ankle disability because no treatment records support the Veteran's contention and "recent" records do not show a history of falls.  However, the record contains, and the examiner cited to, March 2021 treatment records of the Veteran seeking medical care for right wrist pain after a fall.  Because the opinion relied on finding no evidence exists, but then cited to evidence which does, the opinion is internally inconsistent and based on an inaccurate premise.   

Second, though the examiner found the Veteran's fall history did not cause his right wrist disability, they did not discuss aggravation.  Therefore, remand is required to obtain a supplemental medical opinion which accurately considers the evidence of record and considers the aggravation theory of 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a supplemental medical opinion as to whether the Veteran's right wrist disability was caused or aggravated by falling due to his left ankle injury.  A new examination may be scheduled at the AOJ's or the examiner's discretion.
