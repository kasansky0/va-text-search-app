ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis of the left foot is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's plantar fasciitis of the left foot is secondarily related to his service-connected diabetes mellitus, type II.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis of the left foot, on a secondary basis, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from May 1971 until his honorable discharge in October 1975.

Most recently, this matter was remanded in February 2023 for a new examination. That development was completed, and the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision in December 2023. Thereafter, in the December 13, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis of the left foot is granted.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for plantar fasciitis of the left foot, secondary to service-connected diabetes mellitus, type II.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Alternatively, service connection may also be granted for disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Secondary service connection may be established by a showing that a nonservice-connected disability is caused or aggravated (chronically worsened) by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc).

The evidence against the claim includes the July 2023 medical opinion obtained on remand. The examiner opined that the Veteran's conditions were not related. The examiner premised the opinion upon a review of the literature, noting that while some literature supported a correlation between diabetes mellitus, type II, and plantar fasciitis, overall, the literature did not support a causative relationship between diabetes mellitus, type II, and plantar fasciitis.

The evidence in favor of the claim includes a positive nexus opinion from the Veteran's private physician, received by VA on March 12, 2025. The Veteran's private physician opined as follows:

"It is my medical opinion that it is more likely than not that the Veteran's left foot plantar fasciitis is due to his service-connected neuropathy and diabetes. As noted in the literature below, patients with neuropathy commonly develop plantar fasciitis as a secondary complication due to the patient being unable to feel pain from the microtear trauma to the plantar fascia. Furthermore, I disagree with the disability examiner who notes no causal relationship between diabetes and plantar fasciitis. As noted in the literature below, diabetes is a known risk factor for development of plantar fasciitis due to the presence of associated neuropathy, obesity, and a more sedentary lifestyle."

Both opinions are competent, credible, and probative, as the examiners have the requisite expertise and have carefully considered the Veteran's records and the medical literature. If anything, the March 2025 positive nexus opinion from the Veteran's private physician is more probative because it has considered and addressed the rationale of the July 2023 negative nexus opinion. In reviewing the literature included in the March 2025 opinion, the Board observes that the literature clearly states that "plantar fasciitis is a secondary condition to neuropathy." In this regard, the Veteran is service-connected for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in both his left and right lower extremities, which is necessarily associated with his diabetes. The Board finds that the Veteran has, thereby, satisfied his burden for establishing the elements of secondary service connection, and, as a result, his claim for entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis of the left foot is granted.
