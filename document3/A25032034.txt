ORDER

An effective date of October 8, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with bipolar II disorder is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On March 6, 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's original claim for service connection for PTSD with bipolar II disorder, claimed as major depression/adjustment disorder.

2. In a final rating decision issued in December 2012, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for depression with adjustment disorder.

3. On October 8, 2019, VA received the Veteran's intent to file, which was followed by receipt of his VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) on October 9, 2019, to reopen his claim of entitlement to service connection for a mental disorder, and the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim since receipt of his informal claim to reopen.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The December 2012 rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for depression with adjustment disorder is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c) (West 2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 20.302, 20.1103 (2012).

2. The criteria for an effective date of October 8, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for PTSD with bipolar II disorder have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Navy from August 1988 to May 1991.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in May 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to November 15, 2019, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder with bipolar II disorder.

The Veteran has appealed with respect to the propriety of the effective date assigned for the award of service connection for PTSD.  The Veteran's representative asserts that the December 2012 rating decision should be reconsidered to consider evidence that was allegedly not in the Veteran's claims file at the time the AOJ rendered their decision.

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

However, 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) provides, in pertinent part, that new and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period.  In this regard, the Board acknowledges the representative's assertion that new and material evidence in the form of VA treatment records was constructively received within one year of the December 2012 rating decision.  Notably, the record does not reflect receipt of such within the one-year appeal period.  Nevertheless, even if the Board were to accept that VA was in "constructive" receipt of such records given their nature (VA treatment records), the Board finds such were not material.  Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim (emphasis).  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).  New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).  

By the representative's own admission, the relevant VA treatment records demonstrated a mental health diagnosis and continued treatment for such.  However, the evidence of record at the time of the December 2012 rating decision was replete with diagnoses and treatment for mental disorders.  They do not include a reference, to include the Veteran's own lay statements, of an in-service event, injury, or illness, or a nexus linking the Veteran's mental disorders to service.  Although the representative asserts such treatment records also indicate the Veteran sought mental health treatment shortly after his separation from service, the Board does not find such evidence therein.  Rather, the first documentation of treatment for mental health is shown as 1995, approximately four years after the Veteran's separation from service, and the Veteran did not report at that time having sought treatment shortly after service.  More importantly, the December 2012 rating decision based the denial of service connection on an absence of an in-service event, injury, or illness.  Consequently, the Board finds the VA treatment records constructively received within one year of the December 2012 rating decision, while new, were not material as they did not relate to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.

Additionally, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1) provide that, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if it receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim.  Such records include service records that are related to a claimed in-service event, injury, or disease.  This regulation does not apply to records that VA could not have obtained when it decided the claim because they did not exist or because the claimant failed to provide sufficient information for VA to identify and obtain the records.  Id. at (c)(2).  An award made based all or in part on the records identified by paragraph (c)(1) is effective on the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously denied claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this part applicable to the previously denied claim.  Id. at (c)(3).

Such regulation essentially establishes that, where an initial claim is denied due to the lack of evidence of an in-service event, but is later granted based all or in part on subsequently acquired service records establishing the in-service event and a nexus between the in-service event and the current disability, the claimant is entitled to a retroactive evaluation of the disability to assess the proper effective date, which would be the date of the original claim or the date entitlement otherwise arose, whichever is later.  Id.; Vigil v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 63, 66-67 (2008); Blubaugh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d. 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (section 3.156(c) only applies 'when VA receives official service department records that were unavailable at the time that VA previously decided a claim for benefits and those records lead VA to award a benefit that was not granted in the previous decision.'  New and Material Evidence, 70 Fed. Reg. at 35,388.); Kisor v. Shulkin, 869 F.3d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (the term "relevant official service department record" in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1) means "noncumulative and pertinent to the matter at issue in the case"). In this sense, the original claim is not reopened, rather, it is reconsidered and such serves as the date of the claim and the earliest date for which benefits may be granted.

In this regard, the Board acknowledges the representative's assertions that the award of service connection in the May 2023 rating decision was based, at least in part, on service department records received after the December 2012 rating decision that existed at the time of the rating decision.  Specifically, the representative identifies a Report of Separation and Record of Service from the Army National Guard, which shows the Veteran was discharged under honorable conditions due to unsatisfactory participation, that was associated with the record in March 2022.  The Board acknowledges such is an official service department record that does not appear to have been available at the time of the December 2012 rating decision.  However, the May 2023 rating decision does not show that the award of service connection was based, at least in part, on this record.  Instead, the AOJ identified a private medical opinion received in March 2021, a VA medical opinion and addendum, medical treatment records, and service treatment records as the basis for the opinion.  With respect to the latter, the AOJ clearly identified a May 22, 1991, service treatment record that showed a marker indicative of a personal trauma that both private and VA medical opinions had associated to the claimed condition.  In this regard, the record shows the May 22, 1991, service treatment record reflecting a test for HIV was of record at the time of the December 2012 rating decision.  Consequently, while additional service department records were received, such did not serve, even in part, as the basis for the eventual award of service connection.  Therefore, the Board finds there is no basis upon which to reconsider that decision for the purpose of establishing an earlier effective date. 

In the instant case, VA received the Veteran's original claim for service connection for depression with adjustment disorder on March 6, 2012, which was denied in the rating decision issued in December 2012.  The Veteran was advised of the decision and his appellate rights but did not enter a notice of disagreement.  Additionally, as described in greater detail above, no new and material evidence was physically or constructively associated with the record within one year of the issuance of such decision, and no relevant service department records have since been received that served as part of the basis of the award.  Therefore, the December 2012 rating decision is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c) (West 2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 20.302, 20.1103 (2012).

As such, the remaining question is whether the Veteran filed an informal or formal claim following the December 2012 rating decision but prior to the receipt of his informal claim on November 15, 2019.  Here, the record indicates VA received an intent to file on October 8, 2019, followed by the Veteran's completed VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) on October 9, 2019, which identified a claim for service connection for mental disorders, to include depression and adjustment disorder.  In addition, such claim remained pending until the award of service connection in the May 2023 rating decision.  However, there is no communication between the issuance of the December 2012 rating decision and receipt of the Veteran's intent to file on October 8, 2019, that may be construed as a formal or informal claim for service connection for a mental disorder. In fact, there was no documentation associated with the file during this period.

Therefore, based on the above-stated facts and regulations, the Board finds that the correct effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD with bipolar II disorder is October 8, 2019, the date the Veteran's most recent intent to file was received following the final December 2012 rating decision.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  As such, an effective date of October 8, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for PTSD with bipolar II disorder is warranted.
