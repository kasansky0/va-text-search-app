DOCKET NO. 241212-497600
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for restoration of a 30 percent rating for hypothyroidism is granted; the 30 percent rating is restored, effective February 1, 2025.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hypothyroidism has not improved such that there is an improvement in his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for restoration of a 30 percent rating for hypothyroidism, effective February 1, 2025, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5112 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1968 to July 1972.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on April 3, 2025. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). The Board notes that the Veteran waived the remaining period after his hearing to submit evidence. See April 2025 Board hearing. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the Veteran clarified that his appeal is limited to whether the reduction for hypothyroidism is proper. See April 2025 Board hearing. The Board has characterized the appeal accordingly.

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the requirement that the Board delay issuing a decision until the period to request to switch dockets elapses pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024). Nonetheless, the grant herein is considered a full grant of the benefit sought. Therefore, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with adjudication. 

Whether a reduction of a 30 percent rating for hypothyroidism to a noncompensable rating, effective February 1, 2025, was proper.

For reductions, 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) requires the AOJ to issue a rating decision proposing the reduction and setting forth all material facts and reasons, notify the beneficiary of the contemplated action and furnish detailed reasons therefore, and allow 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that payments should continue at the present level. If a reduction is found to be warranted upon consideration of any additional evidence submitted, final rating action will be taken, and compensation will be reduced effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice of the final action expires. See Stelzel v. Mansfield, 508 F.3d 1345, 1347-49 (Fed. Cir. 2007); VAOPGCPREC 71-91 (Nov. 7, 1991).

In a rating reduction case, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, but also that the improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420-21 (1993); Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).

In considering the propriety of a reduction, the Board must focus on the evidence of record available to the AOJ at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered for the limited purpose of determining whether the condition has demonstrated actual improvement. Cf. Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 281-82 (1992).

As an initial matter, the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) have been met. In March 2024, the AOJ notified the Veteran of the proposed reduction.

Although the AOJ proposed reducing the Veteran's rating on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), see March 2024 rating decision, the reduction decision itself does not discuss CUE. As such, the Board will adjudicate this matter on the basis that the Veteran's rating was reduced on the basis that his disability improved.

During a November 2023 VA thyroid examination, the Veteran reported that he had no current symptoms of hypothyroidism. The examiner opined that the Veteran's hypothyroidism impacted his ability to work, as the Veteran reported missing one week of work per year.

During a July 2024 VA thyroid examination, the Veteran reported fatigue, rapidly thinning hair, and rough and scaly skin on his face, ears, and arms. The examiner opined that the Veteran did not have any findings, signs, or symptoms attributable to hist thyroid condition, but he opined that the Veteran's hypothyroidism affected his ability to work, as the Veteran reported his condition affected his daily life due to him always being extremely fatigued and exhausted.

After consideration of the evidence of record, the evidence does not reflect that there was an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Overall, the Veteran's condition appears to have worsened. Indeed, the evidence reflects minimal symptoms in November 2023 and then, less than a year later, the Veteran reported symptoms including fatigue and exhaustion. As a result, the requirements for a reduction have not been met and the Veteran's 30 percent rating for hypothyroidism is restored.
