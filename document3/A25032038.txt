ORDER

The appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for glaucoma-related blindness is dismissed.

The appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for urinary incontinence is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In November 2018, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) remanded numerous issues under appeal, including the issues of entitlement to service connection for glaucoma-related blindness and urinary incontinence.

2. Following the November 2018 Board remand, on February 12, 2025, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) denying, in pertinent part, the issues of entitlement to service connection for glaucoma-related blindness and urinary incontinence.

3. On April 23, 2024, prior to the issuance of the February 2025 SSOC, the Veteran's fiduciary filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), requesting direct appeal of her objections to the length of time it was taking the AOJ to process the November 2018 Board remand and of her objections to the locations of scheduled VA examinations as well as to the Veteran having to attend the examinations for blindness and urinary issues in the first place. At the time the fiduciary filed the April 2024 VA Form 10182, there was not an appealable rating decision or notification letter adjudicating any question of law or fact related to the fiduciary's stated issues. As such, the April 2024 VA Form 10182 was invalid because it was not based on any appealable decision in which the AOJ decided any question of law or fact that could be subject to Board review.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for glaucoma-related blindness have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4, 20.205. 

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for urinary incontinence have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from April 1970 to February 1975. 

In an April 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran's fiduciary requested that the Board conduct a direct review of the scheduling basis and locations for the Veteran's VA examinations for glaucoma-related blindness and urinary incontinence, as well as of the time it was taking the AOJ to process a November 2018 Board decision. 

The Board notes that the November 2018 Board decision in the legacy appeals system, in pertinent part, remanded the claims of entitlement to service connection for glaucoma-related blindness and urinary incontinence for further development. After the AOJ completed the additional development, on February 12, 2025, the AOJ issued an SSOC that, in pertinent part, denied entitlement to service connection for glaucoma-related blindness and urinary incontinence. Because the AOJ denied the Veteran's claims for entitlement to service connection for glaucoma-related blindness and urinary incontinence in the SSOC, those issues will be returned to the Board for adjudication as part of the legacy appeal system. A March 2025 docketing letter shows that, indeed, the Veteran's legacy case has been returned to the Board and re-docketed for adjudication.

In April 2024, the Veteran's fiduciary filed a VA Form 10182, requesting that the Board review issues with the locations where the Veteran's VA examinations were scheduled, why the Veteran was being asked to attend the VA examinations in the first place, and the length of time it was taking the AOJ to process the November 2018 Board remand. The fiduciary further requested that the Board reinstate "lost and forfeited" claims of "blindness" and "urinary tract." The fiduciary referenced an April 5, 2024, decision related to these cited issues.  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds there was no AOJ decision issued in April 2024. Neither was there any AOJ decision issued between the November 2018 Board decision and the April 2024 VA Form 10182 that addressed the claims of entitlement to service connection for glaucoma-related blindness and urinary incontinence. The Board has jurisdiction to make decisions in appeals on all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary of the VA under a law that affects the provision of VA benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. An appeal consists of a Notice of Disagreement timely filed to the Board on any issue for which VA provided notice of a decision affecting provision of benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.4. Here, the fiduciary's April 2024 VA Form 10182 is not appealing any decision subject to Board review in the modernized review system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). The AOJ did not decide any question of law or fact; thus, there is no issue of law or fact for the Board to review. Accordingly, a dismissal of this appeal is warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(a), 7105(d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.201.
