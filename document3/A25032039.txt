REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a lower back condition, to include lumbosacral strain and degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1996 to April 1997 and October 2002 to August 2003.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Because the April 2024 rating decision on appeal was issued after February 19, 2019, it is subject to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400 (a)(1); 19.2(a).

In September 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review the April 2024 rating decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for a lower back condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a lower back condition, to include lumbosacral strain and degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome, is remanded.

The Veteran contends he currently suffers from a lower back condition that is proximately due or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities. See September 2024 VA Form 10182.

The AOJ identified several favorable findings, including: (1) The Veteran was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome in 2021; and (2) the Veteran was diagnosed with lumbosacral strain in 2017. See April 2024 Rating Decision.

However, the Board cannot make a fully-informed decision on the issue of lower back condition because no VA examiner has adequately opined whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed lower back conditions were aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).

For a medical opinion to be adequate, it must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. See Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). Thus, a medical opinion is adequate when it is based upon consideration of a veteran's prior medical history and examinations, and it also describes the disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claim disability will be a fully informed one. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

For a VA medical opinion to adequately address a theory of entitlement of secondary service connection, the opinion must include not only whether the claimed disability was caused by, but also if it was aggravated by the service-connected disability. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013).

Here, following a March 2024 VA examination, a VA examiner concluded the Veteran's service-connected disabilities less likely than not caused the Veteran's lumbosacral strain and degenerative disc disease. 

The March 2024 VA examination report is inadequate because it does not address whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities aggravated his diagnosed lower back conditions. An examiner's failure to address whether a service-connected disability aggravated a nonservice-connected condition is contrary to established case law, and such opinions are therefore inadequate. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013). Thus, the March 2024 VA examination report is inadequate for failure to address aggravation. 

Accordingly, the Board must remand this matter to obtain an adequate VA opinion.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician to determine the nature and etiology of any lower back disability present during the period on appeal. The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand, must be provided to, and reviewed by, the clinician before rendering the opinion. It is up to the discretion of the reviewing clinician as to whether a new examination is necessary to provide an adequate opinion. 

For each current lower back disability, the reviewing clinician must opine on:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's lower back disability was proximately due to his service-connected disabilities;

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's lower back disability was aggravated by his service-connected disabilities;

The examiner is advised that aggravation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) does not require that there be "permanent" worsening of the nonservice connected disability.

The examiner is also advised that 38 U.S.C. § 1110 allows for service connection of conditions that would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability even if the worsening of the condition occurs due to the natural progression of that condition. See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (2023).

The examiner must provide separate opinions and rationales to address secondary causation and secondary aggravation. Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74 (2018).
