DOCKET NO. 210305-166893
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of a 100 percent disability rating is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's request for an earlier effective date for the award of a 100 percent disability rating constitutes a "freestanding" earlier effective date claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The claim for an effective date for entitlement to a 100 percent disability rating is dismissed as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110, 5121; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.151, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1974 to February 1977.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2020.

In the January 6, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 3, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of a 100 percent disability rating is dismissed.

This appeal arises from an October 2020 rating decision which increased the Veteran's disability ratings for his left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities from 10 to 20 percent, effective September 29, 2020. The rating decision also granted service connection for a thoracic strain, combined the disability with the already service-connected lumbar spine disability, and continued a 40 percent disability rating.

In his January 2021 NOD, the Veteran expressed disagreement not with the individual ratings assigned, but with the fact that he was not in receipt of a 100 percent disability rating from the date of his separation from service in 1977. The Veteran did not clearly indicate for which specific disability he was seeking an earlier effective date nor did he allege clear and unmistakable error in any prior rating decision in his NOD.

While the Veteran and his representative argued in the December 2024 for an earlier effective date for a lumbar spine disability, this matter was not perfected for appeal in the present AMA appeal, and testimony as to that issue was taken in error. The only issue properly before the Board in the instant appeal is the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for a 100 percent disability rating.  The Board further notes, however, that there is still pending in the legacy appeals system a perfected appeal as to the effective date of the grant of service connection for a lumbar spine disability and an increased rating for such. This matter is discussed further below in terms of a specific Referral to the RO for appropriate action.  

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that VA claimants may not properly file, and VA has no authority to adjudicate, a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date in an attempt to overcome the finality of an unappealed RO decision. See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299-300 (2006). The Court reasoned that allowing such claims would vitiate the rule of finality and held that, when such a freestanding claim is raised, such an appeal should be dismissed. Id. at 299-300.

Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for the award of a 100 percent disability rating must be dismissed. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 429-30 (1994) (where law and not evidence is dispositive, claim should be denied, or appeal terminated because of lack of legal merit or lack of entitlement under law.

REASONS FOR REFERRAL 

The Board observes that the Veteran has properly perfected an appeal in the legacy system as to the effective date of the grant of service connection for a lumbar spine disability and an increased rating for such. To wit, the Veteran was issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) in December 2016. In a January 2017 VA Form 9, the Veteran properly perfected his appeal as to those issues and requested an in-person hearing at his local VA Regional Office (RO). The RO then issued a Supplemental Statement of the Case later in January 2017. To this date, that legacy appeal appears not to have been docketed, and there is no indication the Veteran attempted to withdraw his legacy appeal. Therefore, the Board herein refers the matter to the RO for appropriate action on that appeal, to include contacting the Veteran for the purpose of the scheduling of the requested hearing in this legacy appeal.
