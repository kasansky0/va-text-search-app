CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for?right thumb strain have not been met.  38?U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.? 

2. The criteria for service connection for?left thumb strain have not been met.  38?U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1988 to July 1997.??? 

This appeal comes from a July 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision.? See VA Form 10182 AMA Notice of Disagreement (Direct Review Lane) received September 2024.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AMA decision on appeal.? 38?C.F.R. § 20.301.? 

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.??38?U.S.C. § 1131;?38?C.F.R. §?3.303.? Service connection means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service, or if preexisting service, was aggravated therein.??38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).? Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).???????? 

To establish service connection for a disability, there must be competent evidence of the following: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or "nexus" between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.? Horn v.? Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?231, 236 (2010);?Shedden?v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004);?Gutierrez v.?Principi, 19?Vet. App.?1, 5 (2004) (citing Hickson v.?West, 12?Vet. App.?247, 253 (1999)).? In many cases, medical evidence is required to meet the requirement that the evidence be "competent."? However, when a disability may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature" and is capable of lay observation.? Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 309 (2007).???????? 

Service connection for certain chronic diseases?may be presumed to have been incurred in service by showing that the disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1112;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).? Such a chronic disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even though there is no evidence of that disease during the period of service.??38?C.F.R. §§?3.307(a).? 

When a chronic disease is shown in service, sufficient to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.??38?C.F.R. §?3.303 (b).? To be "shown in service," the disease identity must be established, and the diagnosis must not be subject to legitimate question.??Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2013);?see also 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b).? There is no "nexus" requirement for compensation for a chronic disease which was shown in service, so long as there is an absence of intercurrent causes to explain post-service manifestations of the chronic disease.? Walker, 708 F.3d at 1336.???????? 

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.? VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.? Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.? 38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).? 

Service connection for right and left thumb strain.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral thumb strain related to the rigors of physical training during service.

The competent evidence of record confirms that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a bilateral thumb disability.  Here the VA examiner in December 2023 diagnosed bilateral thumb strain.  

The service treatment records contain no complaints, history or findings consistent with a thumb disability or trauma, to include strain.  On separation from service in April 1997, the upper extremities, including her thumbs, were clinically evaluated as normal and no thumb problems were reported.  

Additionally, there is no evidence contemporaneous with service showing complaints or findings consistent with a thumb condition.  

After service, VA treatment records in December 2023, show that the Veteran was fitted with a right thumb spica wrist brace.

Furthermore, arthritis was not shown in service or within one year following discharge from active duty service, as such, service connection cannot be established for arthritis on a presumptive basis.  38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

More importantly, the record does not show that the?Veteran?had a continued problem?with either thumb in and since service.? 

The Board notes that the first documented evidence of any thumb complaints was initially noted more than one 25 years after the Veteran's discharge from service.? In so noting, the Board recognizes that the mere absence of medical records is not dispositive as to the question of continuity; the lay evidence must be considered as well.? See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d at 1335.? If, however, it is determined based on reliable evidence, that there was an extended period of time after service without any manifestations of the claimed condition, then that tends to weigh against a finding of a connection between the disability and service.? see also Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).? 

To the extent the Veteran may assert continuity of symptomatology from service, the Board finds such statements acutely inconsistent with the overall record, to include the service treatment records and post-service treatment records, which fail to document any related complaints until more than two decades after discharge from active duty service.  Thus, the Veteran did not adequately show that her post-service complaints of thumb symptoms continued in and since service.  Further, a "strain" is not always a "disability"?for VA purposes.  The fact that the Veteran strained her thumbs in service (assuming he did) does not necessary lead to the conclusion that he has a chronic disability associated with that strain several years ago. 

In reaching the above conclusion, the Board does not rely solely on the absence of contemporaneous evidence corroborating the Veteran's reports of continuity. Instead, there is evidence in the service treatment records, to include the Veteran's separation examination and medical history report in April 1997 at which time her upper extremities were clinically evaluated as normal and no thumb problems were reported.  It is also noteworthy that prior to filing of a claim for VA benefits, there is no evidence of in-service trauma or reports of symptoms in and since service.  See Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2?Vet. App.?24, 25 (1991) (pecuniary interest may affect the credibility of testimony); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?498, 510-511 (1995) (credibility can be generally evaluated by a showing of interest, bias, or inconsistent statements, and the demeanor of the witness, facial plausibility of the testimony, and the consistency of the testimony). 

While the service records clearly provide evidence against the claims, it is equally important for the Veteran to understand that the post-service treatment records provide more evidence against the claims, clearly suggesting a post-service bilateral thumb problem. 

Therefore, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran did not have a continued problem with her thumbs in and since her separation from active duty in 1997, more than 28 years ago.  See 38 U.S.C. § 101, 106, 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

Furthermore, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's post-service thumb problems are not due to her military service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 106, 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d); also see Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992) (establishing service connection requires finding a relationship between a current disability and events in service or an injury or disease incurred therein).

In fact, the Board observes that the only medical opinions of record weigh against the claims.

On VA examination in December 2023, the Veteran reported onset of bilateral thumb hand pain and stiffness in 1997, which she attributed to physical training. Following a review of the evidence and an examination of the Veteran, the examiner diagnosed bilateral thumb strain and opined the thumb strain was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  In support of the opinion, the examiner noted that the Veteran's in service medical records, including her separation examination report in 1997, were silent for any thumb complaints.  Moreover, the Veteran's post separation records were also silent for any thumb complaints.  Additionally, the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS), unit supply, was not an MOS generally associated with causing thumb strain.  Therefore, the examiner concluded that it was less likely than not that the right and/or left thumb disability was related to service.

The Board finds the 2023 VA examiner's opinion to be highly probative.  The opinion was based on a thorough review of the claims file, including the service treatment records, and examination and interview of the Veteran, and the opinion is internally consistent and consistent with other evidence of record, including treatment records.  Moreover, the examiner provided adequate rationale for the opinions.  Accordingly, the VA examiner's opinion is entitled to great probative weight.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 303-304 (2008). Significantly, there is no competent medical opinion that contradicts the VA examiner's opinion.

The Board has considered the statements from the Veteran asserting that her bilateral thumb strain was caused or aggravated by service.? The Veteran is certainly competent to report as to the observable symptoms she experienced, but she cannot diagnose herself because of the medically complex nature of such a diagnosis.? See Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App. 465, 470?(1994); See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, at 1376-77?(Fed. Cir. 2007).  The ultimate questions in this case are related to an internal medical process which extends beyond an immediately observable cause and effect relationship.?Id.? Moreover, whether the symptoms the Veteran experienced in service or following service are in any way related to any injuries incurred therein, is a matter that requires medical expertise to determine.? See Clyburn v. West, 12?Vet. App.?296, 301 (1999).? The Board finds that the specific, reasoned opinion of the VA examiner of greater probative weight than the more general lay assertions in this regard.? The examiner has training, knowledge, and expertise on which he relied to form the opinions, and the examiner provided rationale for the conclusions reached.?? 

Simply stated, both the best medical evidence in this case, and the facts of this case, provide highly probative evidence against the claims, indicating problems with the thumbs that began many years after service with no connection to service.????? 

In summary, there is no competent evidence of arthritis in service or within one year following discharge from service.? Thus, the provisions regarding continuity of symptomatology are not applicable.? See Walker, 708 F.3d at 1340.? Moreover, the most probative and persuasive evidence is against a finding that her current bilateral thumb strain is related to service.????? 

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.? However, the most persuasive evidence weighs against the Veteran's claims.? As such, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and the claims must be denied.? See 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); See?Lynch, 30?Vet. App.?298.??
