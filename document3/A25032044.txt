ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his tinnitus is at least as likely as not related to in-service noise exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1987 to January 1989.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. To establish service connection for a disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3. 309.

The Board finds that the first two elements have been satisfied. In the June 2024 decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran had current diagnosis of tinnitus as well as a finding that the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset during service noting service treatment records that show complaints or treatment similar to the claimed condition. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Accordingly, the Board finds the first and second elements of service connection to be satisfied. 

Turning to the third element, a link between current tinnitus and service, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in May 2024 that concluded that although the Veteran reported recurrent tinnitus, it was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure. Specifically, the examiner noted that there were no significant threshold shifts in hearing thresholds beyond test variability from entrance to separation. However, this conclusion does not account for the Veteran's assertions that his tinnitus had begun during service. Additionally, the examiner noted that the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset during service when documenting the Veteran's history, however, did not address this fact when rendering their opinion. Rather the examiner instead noted that there was no complaints/treatment for tinnitus in the service treatment records or at separation. Conversely, the Veteran has stated that he has had ringing in his ears that has continued since service that included the conceded noise exposure. See May 2024 Audiological Examination.

When weighing this evidence, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise. If the evidence is supportive or is in relative equipoise, then the Veteran prevails. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Accordingly, service connection for tinnitus is granted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).
