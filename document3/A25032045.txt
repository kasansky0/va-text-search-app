ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for insomnia disorder, to include as secondary to service-connected disability, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's insomnia disorder is not proximately due to service-connected disability, or otherwise etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for insomnia disorder have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.304, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1991 to November 1995 and from October 2001 to July 2002.  He appeals a July 2024 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for insomnia disorder.  He opted for direct review of the evidence by this Board.

Service Connection

Under the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a), 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310.  Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 505 (1995).

A disability may also be found service connected on a secondary basis by demonstrating that the disability is either (1) proximately due to or the result of an already service-connected disease or injury or (2) aggravated by an already service-connected disease or injury.  See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (2017).

1. Entitlement to service connection for insomnia disorder.

The Veteran contends that his insomnia disorder is attributable to service.  After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted.

As an initial matter, the Board observes that insomnia is not separately rated when determined to be secondary to a service-connected disability as this would result in impermissible pyramiding.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  The insomnia will simply be incorporated into the rating for the underlying primary disability.  Thus, a separate rating for the Veteran's insomnia is only warranted if it is found to be unrelated to his service-connected left knee and determined to be related to service on its own.    

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent regarding sleep problems.  Indeed, he denied a history of sleep problems at his June 1999 periodic physical and at both his pre- and post-deployment health assessments in October 2001 and July 2002 respectively.  He was diagnosed with insomnia disorder in January 2022.  

The evidence of record does not contain diagnosis, treatment or complaints of any sleep issues prior to August 2020, over 15 years removed from active service.  Indeed, the Veteran reported that he did not take medication for a sleep problem prior to 2020.  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a continuity of symptoms since service has not been established.  

As the record does not contain evidence of sleep problems during service or until many years thereafter, the Board finds that a nexus has not been established regarding service connection on a direct basis.  Importantly, the January 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's insomnia was less likely than not related to active service.  The examiner reasoned that there were no references to sleep disturbance were found in the STRs, and the Veteran denied any complaints of or treatment for sleep disturbance during military service.  

As to service connection on a secondary basis, the Veteran contends that his insomnia is related to his service-connected left knee condition.  Thus far, he has not submitted argument or evidence indicating what relation his insomnia and left knee may have. 

The January 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's insomnia not attributable to his left knee disability.  The examiner found that, based on the record as it stood, the Veteran's insomnia was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of left knee meniscus tear with locking and pain. 

The Board affords significant probative weight to the opinions rendered by the January 2022 and January 2024 VA examiners.  The opinions were provided by qualified medical professionals after review of the claims file and application of the facts to current medical knowledge.  

Based on the foregoing medical and lay evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's insomnia is not related to service-connected disability nor otherwise attributable to active service.   In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the statements made by the Veteran regarding a relation between his insomnia and active service.  However, in this case the Veteran is not competent to testify regarding the etiology of his insomnia.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The diagnosis and evaluation of such a disorder requires the expertise of a qualified medical professional.  Therefore, the unsubstantiated statements made by the Veteran are found to lack competency.

In conclusion, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for insomnia is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided.  This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
