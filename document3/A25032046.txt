FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A claim of service connection for Parkinson's disease was received on February 19, 2010; there is no evidence of any formal or informal claim of service connection for neurological disability (including Parkinson's disease) prior to February 19, 2010.

2. A claim of service connection for cardiac disability, with residuals of coronary artery bypass grafting (including scarring), was received on February 19, 2010; there is no evidence of any formal or informal claim of service connection for cardiac disability or skin disability (including scarring) prior to February 19, 2010.

3. A claim of service connection for Parkinson's disease was received on February 19, 2010 and initially denied in a November 2010 rating decision on the basis that the disability was not related to service and there was no evidence of herbicide agent exposure in service; an application to reopen the claim of service connection for Parkinson's disease was denied in a September 2017 rating decision on the basis that new and material evidence was not received; the Veteran timely appealed the September 2017 decision and the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) ultimately awarded service connection for Parkinson's disease on a presumptive basis due to herbicide agent exposure in service, from February 19, 2010.

4. Claims of service connection for erectile dysfunction, constipation, bilateral upper and lower extremity disabilities (including bradykinesia, tremors, muscle rigidity, and balance impairment), and bilateral loss of automatic movements, all as secondary to Parkinson's disease, were raised in connection with the February 19, 2010 service connection claim on appeal; there is no unadjudicated formal or informal claim of service connection for erectile dysfunction, gastrointestinal disability, upper extremity disability, lower extremity disability, or any other neurological/muscle disability prior to February 19, 2010.

5. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction, constipation, bilateral upper and lower extremity disabilities (characterized as bradykinesia, tremors, muscle rigidity, and balance impairment), and bilateral loss of automatic movements arose prior to or contemporaneous with the Veteran's February 19, 2010 claim.

6. From February 19, 2010, but no earlier, the Veteran had a service-connected disability that caused the loss of use of a creative organ.

7. As a combined 100 percent rating has been awarded, from September 13, 2016 through the date of the Veteran's death, and he was unable to work due to a combination of his service-connected disabilities, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disability during this period is moot.

8. The Veteran required assistance in accomplishing the activities of daily living and was unable to protect himself from the hazards and dangers of his daily environment on account of his service-connected disabilities.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1961 to June 1965, which includes service in the Republic of Vietnam. He died in September 2018 and the appellant, who is his surviving spouse, was substituted for the Veteran.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2022 rating decision.

In a December 15, 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant appealed the December 2022 rating decision, with respect to the effective dates assigned for the award of service connection for the following disabilities: Parkinson's disease; coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting; surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting; erectile dysfunction; constipation; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; loss of automatic movements of the right and left side; urinary incontinence; loss of sense of smell; right and left side stooped posture; and cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance. The appellant also appealed the effective dates assigned for the award of SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) and eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, as well as the initial ratings assigned for surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting; erectile dysfunction; constipation; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; loss of automatic movements of the right and left side; urinary incontinence; loss of sense of smell; right and left side stooped posture; and cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance.

The appellant elected the Board's Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the issues of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for urinary incontinence, loss of sense of smell, right and left side stooped posture, and cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance, entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, entitlement to a TDIU from February 9, 2010 through September 12, 2016, and entitlement to higher initial ratings for surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting; erectile dysfunction; constipation; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; loss of automatic movements of the right and left side; urinary incontinence; loss of sense of smell; right and left side stooped posture; and cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those matters. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

As for characterization of the issues on appeal, the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 rating decision reflects that the Veteran was unemployed during the period on appeal and that he was unable to work due to his service-connected disabilities. A formal claim for a TDIU (VA Form 21-8940) was received in February 2022. Entitlement to a TDIU may be an element of an appeal for a higher initial rating. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Entitlement to a TDIU is raised where a claimant: (1) submits evidence of a medical disability; (2) makes a claim for the highest rating possible; and (3) submits evidence of unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 453. Given the evidence of current disabilities, the claim for the highest ratings possible for the service-connected disabilities listed above, and the evidence of unemployability due to the service-connected disabilities during the period on appeal, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is properly before the Board as part and parcel of the appeal for higher initial ratings for the disabilities listed above.

Moreover, VA has a "well-established" duty to maximize a claimant's benefits. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008). This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a claimant's disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 280 (finding that SMC "benefits are to be accorded when a Veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim"). In this case, as noted by the appellant's representative in a December 2023 statement, the evidence at the time of the December 2022 rating decision raises the issue of entitlement to SMC based on the regular need for the aid and attendance of another person. Therefore, the Board has also expanded the appeal to include this issue.

As a final preliminary matter, the appellant's representative submitted a signed written statement in October 2024 which indicated that the appellant, understanding her rights and through the assistance of counsel, waived the right to a pre-decisional hearing at the AOJ and asked the Board to promulgate a decision on the evidence of record without further delay.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (b) (claimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief.  Such notice will clearly set forth the elements described under paragraph (f) of this section, the right to a hearing on any issue involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the right of representation, and the right, as well as the necessary procedures and time limits to initiate a higher-level review, supplemental claim, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals). Thus, the Board will proceed with adjudication of the matters on appeal.

I. Earlier Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015 to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014). The amendments, however, are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015. As the Veteran's claims of service connection for Parkinson's disease and its manifestations and cardiac disability with residuals of coronary artery bypass grafting were received prior to March 24, 2015, the revised regulations are not inapplicable in this case and will not be discussed further.

Under the former legal authority, any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA, from a veteran or his representative, may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the veteran, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a) (in effect prior to March 24, 2015).

There is no set form that an informal written claim must take. All that is required is that the communication indicates an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, and identify the benefits sought. Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (1999).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 19, 2010 for the award of service connection for Parkinson's disease; coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting; and surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting

The Board finds, for the following reasons, that an effective date earlier than February 19, 2010 for the award of service connection for Parkinson's disease, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, and surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, is not warranted.

The current effective date for the award of service connection for Parkinson's disease, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, and surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, is February 19, 2010. This is the date that a formal claim of service connection for Parkinson's disease was received, and the date that the AOJ determined that an informal claim of service connection for cardiac disability with residuals of coronary artery bypass grafting (including scarring) was received (see a February 2010 "Veteran's Application for Compensation and/or Pension" form (VA Form 21-526)). There is no evidence in the claims file that the Veteran submitted any formal or informal claim of service connection for neurological disability (including Parkinson's disease), cardiac disability, or skin disability (including scarring) at any time prior to February 19, 2010. 

The appellant has not presented any specific argument as to why an earlier effective date is warranted for the award of service connection for Parkinson's disease, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, or surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting. Thus, February 19, 2010 is the earliest possible effective date. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether an effective date earlier than February 19, 2010 for the award of service connection for Parkinson's disease, coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, or surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the award of an earlier effective date for any of these disabilities. The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), is therefore not for application as to these matters. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 13, 2016 for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction; constipation; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; and loss of automatic movements of the right and left side 

The Board finds, for the following reasons, that an effective date of February 19, 2010, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction; constipation; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; and loss of automatic movements of the right and left side is warranted.

The current effective date for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction; constipation; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; and loss of automatic movements of the right and left side is September 13, 2016. This is the date of a Parkinson's Disease Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) (VA Form 21-0960C-1) completed by physician Z.M., on which these disabilities are identified as manifestations of the Veteran's Parkinson's disease. However, as explained above, a claim of service connection for Parkinson's disease was received on February 19, 2010 (see the February 2010 VA Form 21-526). This claim was initially denied in a November 2010 rating decision on the basis that the disability was not related to service and there was no evidence of herbicide agent exposure in service.

An application to reopen the claim of service connection for Parkinson's disease was denied in a September 2017 rating decision on the basis that new and material evidence was not received. The Veteran timely appealed this decision under the legacy appeal system by submitting a "Notice of Disagreement" form (VA Form 21-0958) in March 2018. He subsequently died in September 2018, the appellant was substituted for the Veteran, and a statement of the case (SOC) was issued in April 2020. The appellant opted-in to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) review system with respect to the claim of service connection for Parkinson's disease by submitting a timely VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) in May 2020 and requesting review of the decision made in the April 2020 SOC. The Higher Level Reviewer determined that additional development was necessary and moved the appeal to the Supplemental Claim Lane (see a July 2020 rating decision). The AOJ awarded service connection for Parkinson's disease on a presumptive basis due to herbicide agent exposure in service in a February 2021 rating decision, and ultimately assigned an effective date of February 19, 2010 for the award of service connection for Parkinson's disease in the December 2022 rating decision, from which the current appeal originates.

Evidence that was in the claims file at the time of the September 2017 rating decision reflects that the Veteran experienced various manifestations of Parkinson's disease. For example, the September 2016 Parkinson's Disease DBQ indicates that the manifestations of the Veteran's Parkinson's disease included the following: erectile dysfunction; constipation; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; and loss of automatic movements of the right and left side. In light of this evidence which was in the claims file at the time of the September 2017 rating decision, the Board finds that claims of service connection for erectile dysfunction, constipation, bilateral upper and lower extremity disabilities (including bradykinesia, tremors, muscle rigidity, and balance impairment), and bilateral loss of automatic movements, all as secondary "complications" of Parkinson's disease, were raised in connection with the February 2010 service connection claim on appeal. See Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188 (2021) (38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(2) requires that, when entitlement to secondary service connection is raised, a formal claim for secondary service connection need not be filed, rather, VA must consider those "complications" in connection with the claim on appeal).

Moreover, the Veteran's medical records reflect that he experienced erectile dysfunction, constipation, bilateral upper and lower extremity disabilities (including bradykinesia, tremors, muscle rigidity, and balance impairment), and bilateral loss of automatic movements prior to his February 19, 2010 service connection claim (see e.g., VA treatment records dated from September 2006 to August 2009 and treatment records from Johns Hopkins Medicine dated from April 2003 to April 2008). Therefore, entitlement to service connection for these disabilities, as secondary to Parkinson's disease, arose prior to or contemporaneous with the Veteran's February 19, 2010 claim. Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999) ("[T]he effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA").

In sum, the evidence of erectile dysfunction, constipation, bilateral upper and lower extremity disabilities (including bradykinesia, tremors, muscle rigidity, and balance impairment), and bilateral loss of automatic movements was obtained during the pendency of the Veteran's February 2010 claim. These records reflect that he experienced these disabilities, all as secondary to his Parkinson's disease, at the time of his February 2010 claim. Therefore, an effective date of February 19, 2010 is warranted for the award of service connection for these disabilities. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107 (b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

The Board also finds that an effective date earlier than February 19, 2010 for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction; constipation; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; and loss of automatic movements of the right and left side is not warranted. Specifically, there is no evidence in the claims file that the Veteran submitted any formal or informal claim of service connection for erectile dysfunction, gastrointestinal disability, upper extremity disability, lower extremity disability, or any other neurological/muscle disability at any time prior to February 19, 2010. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 13, 2016 for the award of SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) due to loss of use of a creative organ

The Board finds, for the following reasons, that an effective date of February 19, 2010, but no earlier, for the award of SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) due to loss of use of a creative organ is warranted.

SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) is warranted if a veteran, as a result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k). In order to establish entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k), "the ability of the creative organ to function must be diminished." Bria v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 228, 234 (2021).

In light of the grant of an effective date of February 19, 2010 for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction, an earlier effective date for the award of SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k), an ancillary benefit, is also warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a)(1)(ii). Accordingly, an effective date of February 19, 2010, but no earlier, is warranted for the award of SMC at the (k) rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 for loss of use of a creative organ. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a)(1)(ii).

II. TDIU

Entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disability, from September 13, 2016 through the date of the Veteran's death

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d).

A TDIU may be assigned "where the schedular rating is less than total" and the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of his service-connected disabilities, from securing and following "substantially gainful employment" consistent with his education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

In this case, the Veteran was in receipt of a 100 percent combined disability rating during the period on appeal from September 13, 2016 through the date of his death. Hence, there remains no time during this period where the schedular rating is "less than total," as required for a TDIU. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). 

The Board is cognizant of the fact that the receipt of a 100 percent schedular disability rating for a service-connected disability or disabilities does not necessarily moot the issue of entitlement to a TDIU because a TDIU rating based on a single service-connected disability may still form the basis for assignment of SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s). See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008) ("section 1114(s) does not limit 'a service-connected disability rated as total' to only a schedular rating of 100%, and the Secretary's current regulation permits a TDIU rating based on a single disability to satisfy the statutory requirement of a total rating"). However, as explained below, the Board is awarding SMC based on the regular need for the aid and attendance of another person, which is a greater benefit than SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s).

Moreover, the evidence reflects that, during the period from September 13, 2016 through the date of the Veteran's death, the impairment caused by all of his service-connected disabilities, in combination, were sufficient to preclude all substantially gainful employment. Hence, the facts presented in this case are distinguishable from those in Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 280, because the evidence reflects that it was the combination of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities that rendered him unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment during the period on appeal from September 13, 2016 through the date of his death. The evidence does not reflect, the Veteran did not contend, and the appellant does not now contend that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment due to a single service-connected disability, and the appellant specified on the VA Form 21-8940 received in February 2022 that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow any substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. 

For the above reasons, the Board finds that, with respect to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disability from September 13, 2016 through the date of the Veteran's death, there remains no specific determination with which the claimant disagrees. Thus, pursuant to the applicable statute, the Board will dismiss the appeal as to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU from September 13, 2016 through the date of the Veteran's death, as this issue is moot. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d).

III. SMC

Entitlement to SMC based on the regular need for the aid and attendance of another person 

SMC at the aid and attendance rate is payable when a veteran, due to service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet or one hand and one foot, or is blind in both eyes, or is permanently bedridden or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (b).

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (b)(3) and (4), the criteria for determining that a veteran is so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance, including a determination that he is permanently bedridden, are contained in 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a). That regulation provides that the following will be accorded consideration in determining the need for regular aid and attendance: inability of a claimant to dress or undress himself, or to keep himself ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid; inability to feed himself through the loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect him from hazards or dangers incident to his daily environment.

"Bedridden" is defined as that condition, which, through its essential character, actually requires that a claimant remain in bed. The fact that a claimant has voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice.

It is not required that all of the above disabling conditions be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions that a veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that a veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there is a constant need. Determinations that a veteran is so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that his condition is such as would require him to be in bed. They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a).

In this case, the Veteran was service-connected for the following disabilities at the time of his death: urinary incontinence, rated 60 percent disabling; Parkinson's disease with bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right upper extremity, rated 50 percent disabling; cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance, rated 30 percent disabling; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the left upper extremity, rated 20 percent disabling; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the left lower extremity, rated 20 percent disabling; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right lower extremity, rated 20 percent disabling; type II diabetes mellitus, rated 20 percent disabling; coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, rated 10 percent disabling; constipation, rated 10 percent disabling; loss of automatic movements of the right side, rated 10 percent disabling; loss of automatic movements of the left side, rated 10 percent disabling; left side stooped posture, rated 10 percent disabling; right side stooped posture, rated 10 percent disabling; surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, rated noncompensable; loss of sense of smell, rated noncompensable; and erectile dysfunction, rated noncompensable. His combined disability rating was 100 percent at the time of his death. The Board finds, for the following reasons, that the Veteran required assistance in accomplishing the activities of daily living and was unable to protect himself from the hazards and dangers of his daily environment on account of his service-connected disabilities.

VA treatment records dated from October 2015 to July 2017, a September 2016 Heart Conditions DBQ, and the September 2016 Parkinson's Disease DBQ indicate that as a result of the Veteran's service-connected cardiac disability and Parkinson's disease, he experienced shortness of breath, moderate stooped posture, moderate balance impairment, moderate bradykinesia, moderate loss of automatic movements, moderate to severe bilateral upper extremity tremors, moderate bilateral upper and lower extremity muscle rigidity and stiffness, mild depression, moderate cognitive impairment or dementia, partial loss of sense of smell, moderate sleep disturbance, moderate constipation, severe sexual dysfunction, and weekly falls. The shortness of breath caused by the service-connected cardiac disability resulted in poor endurance. The Veteran had moderate difficulty with his activities of daily living and was assisted at home by the appellant.

In an October 2021 statement, the appellant reported that as a result of Parkinson's disease, the Veteran experienced shaking in his limbs and very poor balance. These symptoms caused difficulty with daily activities and frequent falls, the falls resulted in bruising, and the Veteran injured his ribs due to a fall on one occasion. He experienced difficulty standing and walking, sometimes used a walker and/or wheelchair, had to be lifted up if he sat down (e.g., to get out of the car or get out of bed), and required assistance with using stairs, feeding himself, dressing, and showering. The appellant helped the Veteran to brush his teeth, shave, and cut his hair, took care of all his medical appointments, and drove the Veteran when necessary. Also, the Veteran experienced frequent confusion, would get agitated, and could not focus for prolonged periods. Overall, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevented him from completing daily tasks, and the appellant assisted the Veteran on a daily basis.

The above evidence indicates that the Veteran required assistance with such activities as bathing, dressing/undressing, and feeding himself due to the symptoms and physical limitations caused by his service-connected Parkinson's disease and its manifestations. These disabilities resulted in poor balance and caused frequent falls. In his December 2023 statement, the appellant's representative contended that as a result of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, SMC based on the regular need for the aid and attendance of another person is warranted. In light of the above, the Board agrees with the appellant's representative and finds that the Veteran required assistance in accomplishing the activities of daily living and was unable to protect himself from the hazards and dangers of his daily environment on account of his service-connected disabilities. Therefore, SMC based on the regular need for the aid and attendance of another person is warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 13, 2016 for the award of service connection for urinary incontinence, loss of sense of smell, right and left side stooped posture, and cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance and entitlement to higher initial ratings for urinary incontinence, bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities, cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance, balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities, constipation, loss of automatic movements of the right and left side, right and left  side stooped posture, loss of sense of smell, erectile dysfunction, and surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting, are remanded

VA primary care outpatient treatment notes dated in October 2015 and October 2016, and the appellant's October 2021 statement, indicate that the Veteran received treatment for his Parkinson's disease and its manifestations at Johns Hopkins. Although some records from this treatment provider are in the claims file, they are only dated to March 2009, and the AOJ did not attempt to obtain all such outstanding records. A remand based on this pre-decisional duty to assist error is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these relevant outstanding private treatment records. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

Moreover, in light of the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 rating decision, claims of service connection for urinary disability, loss of sense of smell, stooped posture, and cognitive disability, as secondary complications of Parkinson's disease, were raised in connection with the February 2010 service connection claim on appeal. See Bailey, 33 Vet. App. at 188. It is unclear when these disabilities first had their onset, and no medical opinions were obtained in this regard. As this was a pre-decisional duty to assist error, a remand is necessary to obtain retrospective medical opinions as to the earliest dates that it can be ascertained that the Veteran's urinary incontinence, loss of sense of smell, stooped posture, and cognitive disability had their onset. See Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80, 86 (2008) (discussing situations when it may be necessary to obtain a "retrospective" medical opinion to determine the date of onset or severity of a condition in years past); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 13, 2016 for the award of eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disability from February 9, 2010 through September 12, 2016 are remanded

In the decision above, the Board has awarded earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for the following disabilities: erectile dysfunction; constipation; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; and loss of automatic movements of the right and left side. The AOJ will implement the Board's grants in a future decision. Also, the Board is remanding the remaining earlier effective date and higher rating issues discussed in the remand sections above. 

The issues of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disability from February 9, 2010 through September 12, 2016 are inextricably intertwined with the AOJ's implementation of the Board's award of earlier effective dates and the remand of the remaining earlier effective date and higher rating matters on appeal. Therefore, the DEA and TDIU issues must be remanded. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (two issues are "inextricably intertwined" when they are so closely tied together that a final Board decision cannot be rendered unless both issues have been considered). In this regard, 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a) does not prohibit remanding claims as inextricably intertwined. See Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127, 136 (2024) (remand for correction of an error by the AOJ in satisfying a statutory or regulatory duty includes a remand of the issue of entitlement to a TDIU based on a Board decision granting service connection that impacts the issue of whether TDIU is warranted).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask the appellant to identify the location and name of any VA or private medical facility where the Veteran received treatment for Parkinson's disease and its manifestations, to include the dates of any such treatment.

Ask the appellant to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for all records of the Veteran's treatment for Parkinson's disease and its manifestations from Johns Hopkins and any other sufficiently identified private treatment provider from whom records have not already been obtained. Make two requests for any authorized records, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

2. After all efforts have been exhausted to obtain and associate with the claims file any additional treatment records, obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician as to when the Veteran's urinary incontinence had its onset.

The clinician should provide an opinion as to the earliest date that the Veteran's urinary incontinence had its onset prior to September 13, 2016.

The clinician must provide reasons for each opinion given. 

3. After all efforts have been exhausted to obtain and associate with the claims file any additional treatment records, obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician as to when the Veteran's loss of sense of smell had its onset.

The clinician should provide an opinion as to the earliest date that the Veteran's loss of sense of smell had its onset prior to September 13, 2016.

The clinician must provide reasons for each opinion given. 

4. After all efforts have been exhausted to obtain and associate with the claims file any additional treatment records, obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician as to when the Veteran's right and left side stooped posture had their onset.

The clinician should provide an opinion as to the earliest date(s) that the Veteran's right and left side stooped posture had their onset prior to September 13, 2016.

The clinician must provide reasons for each opinion given. 

5. After all efforts have been exhausted to obtain and associate with the claims file any additional treatment records, obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician as to when the Veteran's cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance had its onset.

The clinician should provide an opinion as to the earliest date that the Veteran's cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance had its onset prior to September 13, 2016.

The clinician must provide reasons for each opinion given. 

6. Implement the Board's award of earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction; constipation; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; and loss of automatic movements of the right and left side (to include the assignment of initial disability ratings) and, after all necessary development is completed, re-adjudicate the following issues: entitlement to earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for urinary incontinence, loss of sense of smell, right and left side stooped posture, and cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance; entitlement to higher initial ratings for urinary incontinence; bradykinesia, tremors, and muscle rigidity of the right and left upper extremities; cognitive impairment with depression and sleep disturbance; balance impairment, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity of the right and left lower extremities; constipation; loss of automatic movements of the right and left side; right and left side stooped posture; loss of sense of smell; erectile dysfunction; and surgical scar associated with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting; entitlement to a TDIU from February 9, 2010 through September 12, 2016; and entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.
