ORDER

Service connection for cause of death is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

In February and January 2024 written correspondence, the Appellant's representative explicitly and unambiguously withdrew the appeal of service connection for the Veteran's cause of death. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of service connection for cause of death by the Appellant's representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Navy from January 1970 to October 1973, including service in Guam.  The Veteran unfortunately died in July 2008, and the Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse. 

The Appellant appealed a November 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that confirmed and continued, on the merits, the prior denial of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.

The Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  An appeal withdrawal is effective when received by the Board.  Id.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  

An effective withdrawal of a claim on appeal must be in writing, include the name of the Veteran, the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 5-7 (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 19.55.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety, or it must list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  Hembree, 33 Vet. App. at 5. 

Here, in both a February and January 2024 letter, the Appellant's authorized representative explicitly and unambiguously requested to withdraw the Appellant's claim for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) and pending Board hearing. 

The letter contained the Appellant's information, Veteran's name, claim number, and a statement that the Appellant wished to withdraw the claim.  Id.  Specifically, the Appellant's representative attached a Statement in Support of the Claim as an exhibit from the Appellant dated January 24, 2024, where the Appellant stated that she was withdrawing the appeal "due to a new avenue of service connection and maintained earlier effective date."  The Board also notes that the current appeal before the Board was the only appeal filed by the Appellant in January 2022. 

The Board is bound by the law, and, in light of the Court's decision in Hembree, there remains no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding the claims.  Thus, the issue must be dismissed.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205; Hembree, 33 Vet. App. at 5-7; Martinez, 36 Vet. App. at 329-330.
