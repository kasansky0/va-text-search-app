DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to beneficiary travel benefits special mode of transportation provided by Ryan Valley Transport (RVT) on February 13, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In October 2022, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

2. Payment of beneficiary travel benefits is not a periodic monetary benefit subject to payment as an accrued or substituted benefits. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim for beneficiary travel benefits associated with travel by a special mode of transportation on February 13, 2020.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from May 1967 to January 1970.  See DD 214.  

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a June 2020 administrative decision of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). 

In the April 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Unfortunately, while this matter was pending on appeal, the Veteran passed away in October 2022.  See October 2022 VA Form 27-0820a Report of First Notice of Death.

The Veteran was represented by the New York Department of Veterans Affairs.  See December 2020 VA Form 21-22 Appointment of Veterans Service Organization (VSO) as Claimant's Representative.  To date, an Informal Hearing Presentation Brief has not been received from the New York Department of Veterans Affairs. 

The Board notes that the Veteran's son has unrelated claims regarding accrued benefits, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, survivor's pension, and or accrued benefits.  The Board notes that there is no indication that the Veteran's son is a claimant in this case nor was recognized by the AOJ as a claimant in this case.  Therefore, the Board proceeds to review this claim for reimbursement or payment of beneficiary travel, special mode.

1. Beneficiary travel special mode on February 13, 2020.

The Veteran filed this claim in April 2021, indicating that his beneficiary travel by special mode of ambulance should have been paid or reimbursed.  See April 2021 VA Form 10182.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of this appeal.  As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths.  

However, please note, that an appellant can be found eligible for substitution or accrued benefits only for claims for periodic monetary benefits, and not for claims for personal benefits administered through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). 38 U.S.C. § 5121 (a), 5121A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000, 3.1010.  Nonrecurring reimbursements are not payable to a substitute.  See Pappalardo v. Brown (6. Vet. App. 63 (1993).  An award for beneficiary travel reimbursement is not a "periodic monthly benefit," but rather a one-time payment afforded to veterans under 38 U.S.C. § 111; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a).   

As to any further due process consideration to afford substitution in this matter, the Board notes that payment of beneficiary travel benefits is not a periodic monetary benefit subject to payment as an accrued or substituted benefits.  

Therefore, a claim for reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses cannot, as a matter of law, be granted based on an accrued benefit, and thus, any possible appellant would also be found ineligible to substitute for the Veteran with respect to this issue because only potential accrued benefit beneficiaries are eligible for substitution.  

Therefore, this appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.
