ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 12, 2023, for the assignment of a 20 percent disability rating for lumbosacral strain is granted.

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 2015 to December 2018.

In May 2024, the Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision which addressed the above-noted issue.  Thereafter, in July 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), wherein he sought to appeal the claim in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) System.  He selected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the RO issued the May 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has elapsed.  In particular, 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows claimants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new Notice of Disagreement (NOD) within one year from the date the RO mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives the NOD, whichever is later; unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in?38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302?and 20.303, or the appellant or their representative has requested a?waiver?of the right to request to switch dockets during this timeframe.  See?Williams?v. McDonough,?37?Vet. App.?305?(2024).  

Because the facts of the case allow for the assignment of the effective date requested by the Veteran, the Board will proceed with a decision in this matter.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his service-connected lumbosacral strain on September 12, 2023; however, he submitted medical evidence on October 12, 2022, which factually demonstrated an increase in the disability warranting a 20 percent disability rating.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the assignment of a 20 percent disability rating for lumbosacral strain have been met since October 12, 2022.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (o), 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5237.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Duties to Notify and Assist

As a preliminary matter the Board notes that, with respect to the Veteran's claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date, the pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute, and the law is dispositive.  Thus, there is no additional evidence that could be obtained to substantiate the claim, and no further action is required to comply with VA's duties to notify and assist under 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A, or 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  See Manning v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 534, 542 (2002); VAOPGCPREC 5-2004 (June 23, 2004).

Burden of Proof

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.  VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.  Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Earlier Effective Date for Increased Back Disability

The general rule with respect to the effective date of an award of increased compensation is that the effective date of the award "shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application thereof."  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a).  This statutory provision is implemented by regulation that provides that the effective date for an award of increased compensation will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1).  However, this regulation does provide for a 1 year look back period, which allows for an earlier effective date when a claimant provides evidence demonstrating an increase was factually ascertainable within the 1 year period before the claim was received.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

A brief history of the Veteran's claim is warranted at the outset.  The Veteran was awarded service connection for his back disability in a January 2020 rating decision.  His representative then submitted a claim for an increased rating on a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application on October 12, 2022.  In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted records from Direct Orthopedic Care as an attachment.  The RO subsequently notified the Veteran's representative that a claim for an increased rating must be filed on a VA Form 21-526.  In September 2023, the Veteran's representative submitted a VA Form 21-526.  

Thereafter, the RO obtained a VA examination, which demonstrated a 20 percent disability rating was warranted for the Veteran's lumbar spine disability.  By way of a January 2024 rating decision, the RO assigned the 20 percent rating from the date the Veteran's VA Form 21-526 was received.  The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date.  

The Board finds the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for his increased rating is warranted by utilizing the appropriate effective date regulations contained in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  In particular, 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2) allows for a 1 year look back period preceding a claim.  Here, the Veteran's records from Direct Orthopedic Care, which were received on October 12, 2022, demonstrate he was prescribed Cyclobenzaprine for his back spasms.  His records also show he underwent x-ray testing, which revealed spondylosis.  This demonstrates the Veteran had abnormal spinal contouring.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5237, muscle spasm severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour warrants a 20 percent disability rating.  As medical evidence was provided within the 1 year period prior to the date the Veteran's completed VA Form 21-526 was received, and that evidence factually demonstrates an increased rating was warranted, an effective date is assignable from the date that evidence was received.  

Accordingly, an increased rating for the Veteran's lumbar strain is granted from October 12, 2022.
