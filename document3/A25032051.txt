ORDER

An effective date earlier than September 10, 2015, for the award of service connection for atopic dermatitis is denied.

An effective date earlier than September 10, 2015, for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

An initial compensable disability rating for atopic dermatitis is denied.

An initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent prior to September 28, 2023, and a disability rating in excess of 20 percent from September 28, 2023, for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On September 10, 2015, VA received the Veteran's service connection claim for atopic dermatitis; a December 2023 rating decision awarded service connection for atopic dermatitis and assigned an effective date of September 10, 2015, the date the Veteran's service connection claim was received by VA.

2. On September 10, 2015, VA received the Veteran's service connection claim for bilateral hearing loss; a December 2023 rating decision awarded service connection for bilateral hearing loss and assigned an effective date of September 10, 2015, the date the Veteran's service connection claim was received by VA.

3. The Veteran's atopic dermatitis does not involve at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy has not been required for a total duration of less than six weeks during any 12-month period on appeal.

4. Prior to September 28, 2023, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was not shown to have been manifested by auditory acuity worse than level IV in the right ear and level IV in the left ear, and when applied to Table VI and Table VII of the VA Rating Schedule, these levels result in a 10 percent disability rating. 

5. From September 28, 2023, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was not shown to have been manifested by auditory acuity worse than level V in the right ear and level V in the left ear, and when applied to Table VI and Table VII of the VA Rating Schedule, these levels result in a 20 percent disability rating.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria are not met to establish an effective date earlier than September 10, 2015, for the award of service connection for atopic dermatitis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria are not met to establish an effective date earlier than September 10, 2015, for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

3. The criteria are not met for to establish an initial compensable disability rating for atopic dermatitis. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7806.

4. The criteria are not met to establish a disability rating in excess of 10 percent prior to September 28, 2023, and a disability rating in excess of 20 percent from September 28, 2023, for bilateral hearing loss. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.85-4.87, Diagnostic Code 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from March 1968 to March 1970, to include service in the Republic of Vietnam.

A rating decision was issued under the legacy system in January 2016, which granted service connection for left ear hearing loss, denied service connection for right ear hearing loss, and denied service connection for atopic dermatitis. The Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement. In March 2019, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a statement of the case (SOC). In May 2023, the Board remanded the claims for further development. A December 2023 rating decision granted service connection for atopic dermatitis and right ear hearing loss. The AOJ also issued a November 2024 supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) regarding the ratings assigned for bilateral hearing loss.

In a December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. The Veteran indicated that he was appealing the December 2023 rating decision and the November 2024 SSOC. As such, the modernized review system, governed by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

By law, for claims appealed in this docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ December 2023 rating decision on appeal and the November 2024 SSOC on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, then, by law, the Board was not permitted to consider that evidence in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Dates

Legal Criteria

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award of service connection for an original claim for service connection is based on facts found but may not be earlier than the date of receipt of application. With limited exceptions (none here applicable), the effective date of an award of service connection is the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.400.

Factual Background and Analysis

On September 10, 2015, the Veteran filed service connection claims for atopic dermatitis and bilateral hearing loss. The December 2023 rating decision granted service connection for these conditions and assigned effective dates of September 10, 2015, the date the Veteran's service connection claims were received by VA.

The Veteran asserted that he was entitled to an effective date prior to September 10, 2015, although he made no specific argument.

The critical question in this matter is when the Veteran filed his service connection claims for atopic dermatitis and bilateral hearing loss.

While he filed informal claims for atopic dermatitis and bilateral hearing loss on February 20, 2014, a February 2014 VA letter informed him that he must complete, sign, and return an enclosed VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, within one year from the date of his informal claims. It is not until September 10, 2015, more than one year from February 20, 2014, the Veteran submitted his service connection claims. The Veteran may have experienced atopic dermatitis and hearing loss symptoms prior to September 10, 2015, he did not file formal service connection claims for these conditions until September 10, 2015.

The Board is bound by governing law and regulations and has no authority to award benefits not authorized by governing law. Because the Veteran is not shown to have filed a formal service connection claim for atopic dermatitis or bilateral hearing loss prior to September 10, 2015, the law prevents VA from granting effective dates prior to September 10, 2015, for the award of service connection for atopic dermatitis or bilateral hearing loss. As the earliest possible effective dates under governing law given the undisputed facts in this case is already assigned, the law is dispositive in this matter. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

Accordingly, the criteria are not met to establish effective dates prior to September 10, 2015, for the grant of service connection for atopic dermatitis and bilateral hearing loss, and the claims must be denied.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4. Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Examination reports are to be interpreted in light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the appellant working or seeking work. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding degree of disability is to be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Atopic Dermatitis

Legal Criteria

The Veteran's atopic dermatitis is rated under Diagnostic Code 7806 for dermatitis or eczema, which in turn rates the disability under the General Rating Formula for the Skin. Under the General Rating Formula for the Skin, a noncompensable rating is warranted for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected. A 10 percent evaluation is warranted for characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected, or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period. A 60 percent evaluation is warranted for characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.

Under the General Rating Formula for the Skin, systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route (orally, injection, suppository, intranasally) other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin. 38 C.F.R. § § 4.118.

Factual Background

On September 10, 2015, the Veteran filed a service connection claim for atopic dermatitis. The December 2023 rating decision granted service connection for atopic dermatitis and assigned an initial noncompensable disability rating effective September 10, 2015. The Veteran asserted that he was entitled to a compensable disability rating.

The Veteran's medical records show that he received treatment for his atopic dermatitis. However, his medical records do not contain findings consistent with a compensable rating. For example, the Veteran's treatment records do not describe coverage of his atopic dermatitis or show that he has required intermittent systemic therapy for a total duration of less than six weeks during the past 12-month period.

In October 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. He reported that his atopic dermatitis had stayed the same since 1999. He reported using a topic cream for treatment. On examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran currently did not have an outbreak. The examiner indicated that the Veteran had treated with an over-the-counter eczema cream for 6 weeks or more, but not constant, during the previous 12 months. The examiner indicated that the Veteran did not require the use of systemic therapy over the past 12 months. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's atopic dermatitis did not result in visible characteristic lesions at the time of the examination. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's atopic dermatitis did not result in any functional impact.

Analysis

The evidence of record does not establish that the Veteran's atopic dermatitis affected at least 5 percent of the entire body or exposed area or required systemic therapy such as corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs, which is consistent with a 10 percent rating. The October 2023 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran had only treated with an over-the-counter eczema cream and had not undergone other treatments. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's atopic dermatitis did not result in visible characteristic lesions or any functional impact. As such, a compensable rating is not warranted.

Accordingly, the criteria have not been met for a compensable rating for atopic dermatitis, and the claim must be denied.

Bilateral Hearing Loss

Legal Criteria

Disability ratings for hearing loss are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are performed. See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992). Hearing loss disability evaluations range from 0 to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity, as measured by controlled speech discrimination tests (Maryland CNC) in conjunction with the average hearing threshold, as measured by puretone audiometric tests in the frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 cycles per second. 

The rating schedule establishes eleven auditory acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity, through Level XI for profound deafness. VA audiometric examinations are conducted using a controlled speech discrimination test together with the results of a puretone audiometric test. The horizontal lines in Table VI (in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85) represent nine categories of the percentage of discrimination based on the controlled speech discrimination test. The vertical columns in Table VI represent nine categories of decibel loss based on the puretone audiometric test. The numeric designation of impaired hearing (Levels I through XI) is determined for each ear by intersecting the horizontal row appropriate for the percentage of discrimination and the vertical column appropriate to the puretone decibel loss.

Table VIA (in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85) is used when speech discrimination tests are inappropriate due to language difficulties, inconsistent speech discrimination scores, etc., or where there is an exceptional pattern of hearing loss (as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 4.86). One such pattern occurs when puretone thresholds at each of the four specified frequencies is 55 decibels or more.

The percentage evaluation is derived from Table VII (in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85) by intersecting the horizontal row appropriate for the numeric designation for the ear having the better hearing acuity with the appropriate vertical column for the hearing acuity level for the ear with the poorer hearing acuity. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(e).

Factual Background

On September 10, 2015, the Veteran filed a service connection claim for bilateral hearing loss. A January 2016 rating decision granted service connection for left ear hearing loss and assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective September 10, 2015. The December 2023 rating decision granted service connection for right ear hearing loss. In turn, the AOJ assigned a 10 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss effective September 10, 2015, and a 20 percent rating effective September 25, 2023. The Veteran asserted that he was entitled to higher ratings.

The Veteran's medical records show that he received treatment for his bilateral hearing loss. However, his medical records do not contain the results of puretone audiometric tests (which are required to rate service-connected hearing loss).

At an December 2015 VA audiological examination, audiometry showed a puretone threshold average of 60 decibels with a speech discrimination score of 76 percent in the right ear and a puretone threshold average of 63 decibels with a speech discrimination score of 76 percent in the left ear. The examiner indicated that the use of speech discrimination scores was appropriate.

At an September 2023 VA audiological examination, audiometry showed a puretone threshold average of 63 decibels with a speech discrimination score of 72 percent in the right ear and a puretone threshold average of 63 decibels with a speech discrimination score of 74 percent in the left ear. The examiner indicated that the use of speech discrimination scores was appropriate.

Analysis

The Veteran's average decibel loss and speech recognition scores at the December 2015 VA audiological examination equates, using Table VI, to a Level IV in the right ear and a Level IV in the left ear. When the results from the December 2015 VA audiological examination are combined on Table VII, a 10 percent rating is warranted.

The Veteran's average decibel loss and speech recognition scores at the September 2023 VA audiological examination equates, using Table VI, to a Level V in the right ear and a Level V in the left ear. When the results from the September 2023 VA audiological examination are combined on Table VII, a 20 percent rating is warranted.

Additionally, Table VIA would not be applicable, because the puretone threshold in either ear was neither 55 decibels at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) nor 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hz. Moreover, there was no indication by the VA audiologists that the speech recognition scores were not appropriate.

The Board has carefully considered the Veteran's lay statements describing hearing difficulties; the Veteran is competent (that is, medically qualified) to report observable symptoms and the Board does not question the Veteran's credibility. However, the Veteran is not qualified to assess, by observation, how those observable symptoms apply to the VA Rating Schedule because this is a medical determination that, by law, must be based on the results of the diagnostic (audiological) testing. See Moray v. Brown, 2 Vet. App. 211, 214 (1993). The rating for hearing impairment is derived by the mechanical application of the Rating Schedule to the numeric designations assigned based on objective audiometric test results. Id.

The Board does not question the Veteran's reports (either the credibility or the competence) about his observable symptoms and about the fact that his bilateral hearing loss results in the reported functional limitations, such as difficulty hearing. However, these limitations are contemplated by the criteria for the disability ratings that are already assigned.

The Board understands that VA's disability rating system for hearing loss can be confusing. The Board urges the Veteran to continue to monitor and assess his hearing loss and, if it worsens, to submit a new claim for an increased disability rating at that time.

[CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE]?

However, as explained above, the criteria are not met to establish a disability rating in excess of 10 percent prior to September 28, 2023, or to establish a disability rating in excess of 20 percent from September 28, 2023, for bilateral hearing loss, and the appeal must be denied.
