REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1966 to October 1967.

The case is on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision.

In the January 2025 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the Regional Office (RO) issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to Higher-Level Review, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider with respect to the other claims, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

By way of procedural history, in an August 2014 rating decision, the RO denied the Veteran's September 2013 claim for service connection for back and right knee disabilities.  In an October 2014 rating decision, the RO noted receipt of additional medical records pertaining to the claimed conditions and deferred a decision on the September 2013 claim pending VA examinations.  See also November 2014 VA examinations (rescheduled following the Veteran's failure to report for earlier examinations).  The Board notes that under the Legacy framework, new and material evidence received during the one-year appeal period following an RO decision is considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011).  In a December 2014 rating decision, the RO readjudicated the claims, to include consideration of the additional evidence, and denied the claims on the merits.  In a January 2015 VA 21-4138 (Statement in Support of Claim), the Veteran requested reconsideration and submitted additional evidence.  Although an August 2015 rating decision stated that the claims were reopened based on receipt of new and material evidence, as noted above, new and material in October 2014 precluded the December 2014 rating decision from becoming final.  Id.  Thus, the August 2015 rating decision was a readjudication of the September 2013 claim, rather than an adjudication of a January 2015 claim to reopen.  See also April 2021 rating decision codesheet (noting that the October 2014 and March 2018 VA examinations did not address back and knee flare-ups and that final evaluations were deferred pending examinations).  Further, the Veteran's September 2015 NOD was within a year of the December 2014 rating decision.  See also March 2018 statement of the case (SOC) & April 2018 Form 9. 

In a February 2019 Board decision, service connection for back and right knee disabilities was denied.  The Veteran appealed the Board decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).

In January 2020, the Court vacated that part of the Board's February 2019 decision that denied service connection for back and right knee disabilities and remanded the matters to the Board.

In an April 2021 decision, the Board granted service connection for back and right knee disabilities.  Also in April 2021, the RO issued a rating decision that assigned initial 10 percent ratings for the back and right knee disabilities, effective September 10, 2013 (date of original claim).  In addition, the decision granted SMC at the housebound rate from September 10, 2013 to September 30, 2015.  The Board notes that although the April 2021 Board decision was issued under Docket Number 18-19-856, the modernized appeal procedures (pursuant to the Appeals Modernization Act) applied to the appeal of the initial disability ratings and effective dates the RO assigned.  See, e.g., Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997); see also, e.g., Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194, 200 (2023).

In a May 2021 rating decision, the initial 10 percent ratings for the back and right knee disabilities were each increased to 20 percent for the entire period, that is, from September 10, 2013.

In an April 2022 VA 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim Application), the Veteran requested review of the April 2021 rating decision with respect to a Higher-Level Review of SMC from an effective earlier date, and the May 2021 rating decision with respect to the ratings and effective date assigned for back and right knee disabilities, including a TDIU.  See also October 2021 Notification Letter.  The Board notes that under the AMA, a claim is considered to be continuously pursued if, among others, a supplemental claim with new and relevant evidence is filed within the one-year appeal period from the issuance of a rating decision.  See Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96 (2024).  See also August 2023 Form 20-0996 (Request for Higher-Level Review). 

In the August 2022 rating decision, the RO increased the rating for the back disability from 20 to 40 percent and for the right knee disability from 20 to 30 percent, effective April 22, 2022, noted to be the date of claim (Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim Application)).  However, as noted above, the December 2014 rating decision adjudicating the original September 2013 claim was not final.

Additionally, the August 2022 rating decision granted basic eligibility to DEA benefits, effective April 22, 2022 and denied as moot the Veteran's August 2022 claim for a TDIU (Form 21-8940 (Veterans Application for Increased Compensation based on Unemployability)).  The Board notes that a combined 100 percent disability rating does not necessarily render moot a claim for a TDIU.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  Instead, a TDIU claim can be granted, despite the existence of a schedular total rating, for the purpose of establishing entitlement to an award of SMC.  Id.  As the higher rating claims are on appeal and there is evidence of unemployability, see e.g., March 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (stating the Veteran was unable to maintain gainful employment due to service-connected back and knee disabilities), the issue of a TDIU is part and parcel of the initial higher rating claims on appeal.  In Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the Court held that a TDIU claim was not a separate claim, and that the potential effective date for TDIU will depend on the date of the underlying claim for service connection or increase.  See also Phillips v. McDonough No. 22-2575, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims (July 30, 2024).  Thus, the issue of a TDIU, effective October 1, 2015, is properly on appeal.

In addition, the January 2024 rating decision on appeal did not address SMC.  The Board notes that although the August 2022 rating decision, which was subject to Higher-Level Review, did not address SMC, SMC is an inferred issue in the context of an increased rating claim that must be considered when the record indicates that it may be available, even if the claimant does not place eligibility for this ancillary benefit at issue.  Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).  Here, the Veteran's April 2022 Form 20-0995 specifically requested review of the April 2021 rating decision with respect to SMC.  As such, the issue of SMC at the housebound rate/based on the need for aid and attendance is also on appeal.

Further, in a statement accompanying the January 2025 NOD, the Veteran's attorney waived remaining time to modify his NOD.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  Nonetheless, thereafter, a January 2025 BVA letter notified the Veteran that if he wanted the Board to consider the additional documents and/or statement submitted with his January 2025 NOD, he could request to change from the Direct Review docket to another Board AMA docket by submitting a new NOD with a new docket choice within 60 days of his January 2025 NOD, or within a year of the decision being appealed, whichever date came later.  The Veteran did not respond or request an extension of time to submit a docket switch request.  Thus, the Board will not further address the additional documents and/or statement submitted with the January 2025 NOD.

In addition, in a February 2025 letter, the Board notified the Veteran that the Board docketed his duplicate January 2025 NOD in error.

The issues of an effective earlier date for the higher ratings for the back and right knee disabilities, as well as for DEA, along with a TDIU and SMC at the housebound rate, are addressed in the decision below.  The remaining issue being remanded is addressed in the remand section.  

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

General Legal Criteria

Ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.  The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

The effective date for an increased rating, as well as for an initial rating or for staged ratings, is predicated on when the increase in the level of disability can be ascertained.  Swain v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?219, 224 (2015); DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?45, 56 (2011).  In determining when an increase is "factually ascertainable," all of the evidence must be looked to, including testimonial evidence and expert medical opinions, and an effective date must be assigned based on that evidence.  See McGrath v. Gober, 14?Vet. App.?28, 35-36 (2000); VAOPGCPREC 12-98.  Thus, "it is the information in a medical opinion, and not the date the medical opinion [that] was provided that is relevant when assigning an effective date."  Tatum v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?139, 145 (2010).

A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2007).

Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one DC requires the use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the rating assigned; an additional code is shown after the hyphen.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

1. An effective earlier date prior to April 22, 2022 for a 40 percent rating for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine.

Specific Legal Criteria

Degenerative or traumatic arthritis established by x-ray findings will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joints or joint involved.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DCs 5003 and 5010.

Back disabilities are rated under either the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine or the Formula for Rating IVDS based on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever method results in the higher evaluation when all disabilities are combined.  38 C.F.R. §?4.71a.

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (general formula), a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent disability rating is warranted when forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding is severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted when forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is 30 degrees or less; or, when there is favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating requires unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine and a 100 percent rating requires unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.

The General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine provides further guidance in rating diseases or injuries of the spine.  In pertinent part, Note (1) provides that any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, should be rated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Note (2) provides that, for VA compensation purposes, normal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is zero to 90 degrees, extension is zero to 30 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 30 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 30 degrees.  The combined range of motion refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation.  The normal combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees.  The normal ranges of motion for each component of spinal motion provided in this note are the maximum that can be used for calculation of the combined range of motion.  See also Plate V, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Otherwise, disabilities of the spine are rated according to the number of incapacitating episodes a person has had in the past 12 months.  An incapacitating episode is a period of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.  See Note (1) to DC 5243.  Under the formula, a 10 percent rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least one week but less than 2 weeks during the past 12?month period, a 20 percent rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration between 2 to 4 weeks during the past 12 month period, a 40 percent rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration between 4 to 6?weeks during the past 12 month period, and a 60 percent rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the past 12 months.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5243, Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  An incapacitating episode is?not?simply the Veteran?taking?to?bed?or being inactive.  Bed?rest?must be prescribed by a physician.  38?C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC?5243, Note (1).

Note (1) to DC 5243 provides that, for purposes of ratings under DC 5243, an incapacitating episode is a period of acute signs and symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA revised the criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disorders.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76464 (Nov. 30, 2020, as corrected).

VA's General Counsel has held that where a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a claim for a higher rating, the Board must first determine whether the revised version is more favorable to the Veteran.  In so doing, it may be necessary for the Board to apply both the old and new versions of the regulation.  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the retroactive reach of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  The Board must generally apply both the former and the revised versions of the regulation for the period prior and subsequent to the regulatory change, but an effective date based on the revised criteria may be no earlier than the date of the change.

Under the revised regulations, effective February 7, 2021, DC 5243 is to be assigned only when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve root; DC 5242 is assigned for all other disc diagnoses.

Analysis

The Veteran's back disability is rated at 20 percent prior to April 22, 2022 and 40 percent thereafter under DC 5242.  He maintains that higher ratings are warranted from an earlier date.  See January 2025 NOD.  

In this case, the evidence shows that the 40 percent disability level first arose earlier than April 22, 2022.  As noted above, an April 2021 rating decision states that neither the October 2014 nor the March 2018 VA examination addressed functional limitation or limitation of motion during flare-ups and that final evaluation was deferred for VA examination.

Thereafter, the Veteran was afforded VA back examinations in May 2021 and July 2022.  The July 2022 examination, upon which the increase to 40 percent was based, reflects forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees, estimated to 20 degrees on repeated use over time, confirming the functional loss, to include on repetitive use, described at the time of October 2014 and May 2018 VA examinations.  See November 2014 & March 2018 C&P Exams.  As noted above, the effective date for an increased rating is predicated on when the increase in the level of disability can be ascertained.  Swain, 27?Vet. App.?219 at 224.  Thus, in view of the evidence, to include the October 2014, March 2018, May 2021, and July 2022 VA examinations, as well as the Veteran's and other lay statements of record, the Board finds the Veteran's lumbar spine disability more closely approximates the criteria for the 40 percent rating from earlier date of September 10, 2013, the date of claim, particularly when resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5242.

The Board notes that the March 2018 VA back examination states that the impression of imaging was severe lumbar spondylosis.  The examination reflects flare ups with repetitive movements of the back, to include lifting, bending, and twisting, as well prolonged standing and walking, and cold and damp weather and weather changes.  Additionally, the examination notes pain throughout all movements of the lumbosacral spine, active and passive, and weight bearing, to include initial range of motion and repetitive use testing.  In addition, the examination indicates additional functional impairment with repeated use over time.

The October 2014 VA back examination reflects additional functional impairment of the back with repetitive movement, to include less than movement than normal and painful motion.  Additionally, the examination states that the Veteran was only able to walk one block and could only sit/stand for 15 minutes at a time due to the back disability.

The Board notes that in a March 2021 Lay Statement, the Veteran's spouse noted that back pain limited the Veteran's mobility, to include walking, sitting/rising from a seated position, and standing even for short periods.  In addition, she noted that the Veteran stopped eating due to back pain, at times.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds the Veteran's lumbar spine disability more closely approximates the criteria for the currently assigned 40 percent rating since the initial claim, i.e., September 10, 2013, particularly when resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5242.  This is the earliest possible effective date.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Board notes that the evidence is absent findings of forward flexion limited to 60 degrees or less, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 120 degrees or less, ankylosis, functional ankylosis, or incapacitating episodes of IVDS resulting in at least 2 weeks of prescribed bed rest in a 12 month period.  Furthermore, the Veteran has not claimed and the medical evidence does not indicate that he has experienced unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine, even during flareups.

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence is in favor of the currently assigned 40 percent rating for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine since the initial claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

2. An effective earlier date prior to April 22, 2022 for a 30 percent rating for a right knee medial meniscus tear with meniscectomy and degenerative arthritis.

Specific Legal Criteria

Limitation of motion of the knee is contemplated within DCs 5260 (flexion) and 5261 (extension).  Separate ratings under DCs 5260 and 5261 may be assigned for disability of the same knee joint.  See VAOPGCPREC 9-2004.

Under DC 5260, a noncompensable rating will be assigned for limitation of flexion of the leg to 60 degrees; a 10 percent rating will be assigned for limitation of flexion of the leg to 45 degrees; a 20 percent rating will be assigned for limitation of flexion of the leg to 30 degrees; and a 30 percent rating will be assigned for limitation of flexion of the leg to 15 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260.

Under DC 5261, limitation of extension of a leg to 5 degrees warrants a zero percent rating.  A 10 percent rating requires that extension be limited to 10 degrees.  A 20 percent rating requires that extension be limited to 15 degrees.  A 30 percent rating requires that extension be limited to 20 degrees.  A 40 percent rating requires that extension be limited to 30 degrees.  A 50 percent rating requires that extension be limited to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA revised parts of the criteria for evaluating the musculoskeletal system.  85 FR 76464 (Nov. 30, 2020).  However, DCs 5260 and 5261 were not revised in the new rating schedule.

Analysis

The Veteran's right knee disability is rated at 20 percent prior to April 22, 2022 and 30 percent thereafter.  He maintains that higher ratings are warranted from an earlier date.  See January 2025 NOD.  

The Board notes that the right knee is rated under DC 5003-5261.  The hyphenated DC here indicates that the Veteran is rated for arthritis under DC 5003 and limitation of extension under DC 5261.  The maximum rating under DC 5003 is 20 percent.

As noted above, an April 2021 rating decision states that neither the October 2014 nor the March 2018 VA examination addressed functional limitation or limitation of motion during flare-ups and that final evaluation was deferred for VA examination.

Thereafter, the Veteran was afforded VA knee examinations in May 2021 and July 2022.  The July 2022 examination, upon which the increase to 30 percent was based, reflects right knee extension to 20 degrees, confirming functional loss at the time of October 2014 VA examination and March 2018 examinations.  Thus, in view of the evidence, to include the October 2014, March 2018, May 2021, and July 2022 VA examinations, as well as the Veteran's and other lay statements of record, the Board finds the Veteran's right knee disability more closely approximates the criteria for the 30 percent rating since the initial claim, that is, September 10, 2013, particularly when resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003-5261.

The Board notes that the March 2018 VA knee examination reflects flare ups of right knee pain with prolonged standing and walking, and cold and damp weather and weather changes and that he needed to stop and rest periodically, and required medication and ice, at times.

The October 2014 VA examination states that the Veteran was only able to walk one block at a time due to his right knee disability.  See November 2014 C&P Exam.

In a March 2021 Lay Statement, the Veteran's spouse noted that knee pain limited mobility, caused falls, and interfered with sleep.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds the Veteran's right knee disability more closely approximates the criteria for the currently assigned 30 percent rating from the effective earlier since the initial claim, i.e., September 10, 2013, particularly when resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003-5261.  This is the earliest possible effective date.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Board notes that the evidence is absent findings of a compensable degree of right knee flexion, instability, or ankylosis, even during flare-ups.  

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence is in favor of a 30 percent rating since the initial claim for a right knee medial meniscus tear with meniscectomy and degenerative arthritis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

3. A TDIU from October 1, 2015.

Legal Criteria

Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that if there is only one such disability, such disability shall be ratable as 60 percent or more, and if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In determining whether a veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, attention must be given to: 

"	The veteran's history, education, skill, and training;

"	Whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy) required by the occupation at issue.  Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, and reaching, as well as auditory and visual limitations; and

"	Whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity.

Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).

Analysis

In his April 2022 Form 21-8940 (Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability), the Veteran stated that that he was unable to work solely due to his service-connected disabilities since January 2013.  He indicated that he had a college degree and had worked as a Director in the safety and security field for 10 years prior to 2013.

As noted above, the RO granted SMC at the housebound rate from September 10, 2013 to September 30, 2015 based on a 100 percent rating for service-connected prostate cancer, and additional service-connected disabilities independently rated at 60 percent or more.  Thus, a TDIU is moot for that period.  Therefore, the issue is whether a TDIU is warranted from October 1, 2015.

In this case, the Veteran's had at least one disability rated at 40 percent and a combined rating of 90 percent effective October 1, 2015.  Thus, the schedular criteria for a TDIU are met.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In that respect, as a result of the Board's grant of earlier effective dates for the higher ratings for back and right knee disabilities, his compensable service-connected disabilities are as follows: PTSD, rated at 30 percent; a left knee disability, rated at 30 percent; prostate cancer, rated at 40 percent; a back disability, rated at 40 percent; a right knee disability, rated at 30 percent; tinnitus, rated at 10 percent; and coronary artery disease rated at 10 percent.  In addition, service-connected bilateral hearing loss, a right leg scar, a left leg scar, tinea pedis and onychomycosis, and erectile dysfunction, are assigned noncompensable ratings.  His combined rating (including the bilateral factor) is 90 percent, from October 1, 2015.  Thus, the schedular criteria for a TDIU are met.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The evidence indicates that the Veteran's education and background was primarily in a sedentary work environment.  (By sedentary, the Board means a non-physical job, primarily involving sitting, and usually performed in an indoor, office-type environment.  See Withers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 139, 147-48 (2018).)

The August 2022 rating decision states that the May 2022 VA PTSD examiner found the Veteran was unemployable due to his service-connected knee disabilities and PTSD.  In that respect, the examination states that the Veteran was physically frail, had difficulty with mobility, and would have difficulty maintaining focus and attention on a job.

A March 2021 non-VA opinion states that the Veteran's back and knee disabilities rendered him incapable of gainful employment even in a sedentary setting since at least 2012.  See March 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.  The opinion notes that given the October 2014 VA examination reflecting the Veteran could only walk for 15 minutes during an 8-hour day, it was clear that his back and knee disabilities resulted in him being incapable of even sedentary work.  In addition, the opinion notes that given his severe degenerative disease, his potential to return to any form of gainful employment was essentially nil.

The March 2018 VA back and knee examinations state that employment requiring prolonged standing or walking, repetitive movements, to include lifting, bending, or twisting, and kneeling or squatting was not recommended.  In addition, and although the examination notes that employment with restrictions due to the back and right and left knee disabilities alone was still possible, as noted above, the Veteran's other service connected disabilities include PTSD, prostate cancer, and tinnitus.

The October 2014 VA PTSD examination reflects occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks.

The October 2014 tinnitus examination notes constant ringing in his ears due to tinnitus that interfered with sleep.

In addition, the rating assigned for the Veteran's prostate cancer residuals contemplates a requirement for the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed 2 to 4 times per day.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528.

The evidence shows that the Veteran has difficulty ambulating due to his service-connected back and knee disabilities.  As noted above, VA examinations reflect that he unable to stand or walk for prolonged periods and/or perform repetitive movements, to include lifting, bending, or twisting, or kneeling or squatting.  He also experiences occupational impairment due to PTSD, to include inability to maintain focus and attention on a job, and at least some functional impairment due to prostate cancer residuals, coronary artery disease, and tinnitus.  Taken together, the record evidence as a whole clearly shows that the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities effective October 1, 2015.

The Board notes that earlier evidence, such as VA examinations conducted in March 2018, indicate his service-connected back and right disabilities alone did not prevent all types of employment.  Here, the Board is granting a TDIU based on the combined effects of his service-connected disabilities.  It is solely within the Board's adjudicative authority to determine unemployability; it is not a medical determination.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Floore v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 376 (2013).

In this case, the evidence is in at least equipoise.  Thus, when applying the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine, a TDIU is warranted.  

The award of TDIU is established from October 1, 2015.  

The evidence reflects that effective October 1, 2015, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevented him from obtaining or maintaining employment consistent with his education and occupational experience.  As noted above, the RO granted SMC at the housebound rate for the entire period prior to October 1, 2015, and thus, a TDIU prior to that date is moot.

In sum, the evidence is in favor of a TDIU due to the Veteran's service-connected disabilities from October 1, 2015, particularly when resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

4. An effective date earlier than April 22, 2022 for the award of DEA.

Basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits for the child or surviving spouse of a veteran may be established if: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510, 5113; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807, 21.3021.

As noted above, in the August 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded basic eligibility to DEA benefits based on a combined 100 percent rating reflecting permanent and total disability status, effective Aril 22, 2022. 

Here, the Board is granting a TDIU from October 1, 2015.  Therefore, the Veteran is entitled to an effective earlier date of October 1, 2015, for basic eligibility to DEA benefits.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510.

Accordingly, an effective date of October 1, 2015, for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA benefits, is granted.

5. SMC at the housebound rate from October 1, 2015.

Specific Legal Criteria

VA has a well-established duty to maximize a claimant's benefits.  SMC at the housebound rate is payable where a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

Analysis

As noted above, the RO awarded SMC at the housebound rate from September 10, 2013 to September 30, 2015.

Since then, the Veteran did not have a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent.  Further, there is no evidence that the Veteran was permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  

As noted above, the Board is granting a TDIU based on the Veteran's combined service-connected disabilities, effective October 1, 2015.  However, as noted above, the Veteran did not have a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent.  Therefore, SMC at the housebound rate from October 1, 2015 is not warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

SMC based on the need for aid and attendance of another.

As noted above, the Veteran's April 2022 VA 20-0995 specifically asserted entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance.  However, the RO has not adjudicated the issue.

The Veteran's attorney stated that the Veteran was unable to function due to service-connected disabilities, to include as a result of unsteadiness, frequent falls, a need for multiple assistive devices, and severe pain, to include as due to his back and right knee disabilities, which prevented him from living independently.  See August 2023 Form 20-0996 (Request for Higher-Level Review).  

In a March 2021 Lay Statement, the Veteran's spouse stated that the Veteran's significant difficulty with activities of daily living, to include limited mobility due to his back and right and left knee disabilities, made his misery unbearable.  She added that the Veteran relied on her to transport him to all medical appointments.  

VA treatment records in February 2022 note that the Veteran's fall risk factors included pain, decreased balance, and environmental obstacles, and that he had had at least one fall with injury requiring treatment in the past 12 months.  See April 2022 CAPRI.  The records reflect issuance of a rollator, a grab bar, and other safety equipment.  In addition, the records indicate the Veteran was dependent with respect to activities of daily living and noted bad mobility.

The Board finds the evidence of record triggers VA's duty to obtain an examination.  However, the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination to determine whether he needs aid and attendance of another person due to his service-connected disabilities.  The Board finds that there is currently insufficient medical evidence of record to make a proper determination as to whether the Veteran is entitled to aid and attendance SMC.  As such, the Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error was made in failing to afford the Veteran a VA examination.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Therefore, a remand for a VA examination is warranted.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an aid and attendance examination.

The examiner should comment on whether service-connected conditions require the regular aid and attendance of another perform to perform the daily activities of living, such as: dressing and undressing; keeping himself ordinarily clean and presentable; feeding; attending to the wants of nature; or protecting him from hazards or dangers incident to his daily environment.  

Rationale for all opinions expressed should be provided.

2. Then, adjudicate the issue of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance.
