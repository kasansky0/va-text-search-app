ORDER

Entitlement to recognition of the Appellant as a substitute claimant is denied.

Entitlement to accrued benefits is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Appellant is the adult child of the Veteran and widow, and not considered a child for purposes of receiving accrued benefits or recognition as a substitute claimant.

2. The evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Appellant paid the expenses of his mother's last sickness or burial.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to recognition of the Appellant as a substitute claimant have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5121A (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010 (2024).

2. The criteria for entitlement to accrued benefits have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5121 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.57, 3.1000 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1941 to June 1945, and from October 1954 to May 1962. The Veteran died in February 1996.

After the Veteran's passing, his surviving spouse, E.K., filed claim seeking to entitlement to Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits. Her claim was eventually awarded in a January 2017 rating decision.

E.K. filed a motion to revise the June 1998 Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) decision which denied entitlement to DIC benefits on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). She also filed a claim seeking entitlement to an earlier effective date for her DIC award. Unfortunately, E.K. died in March 2021. In July 2024, the Board determined that these issues were still pending at the time of her death. 

The Appellant in this matter is the Veteran and E.K.'s son and is seeking to be recognized as a substitute in order to pursue his mother's pending claim and to receive accrued benefits. The Board acknowledges that the Appellant is a veteran as well, and sincerely thanks him for his service. 

This appeal to the Board arose from a September 2024 decision by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claim file that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board interprets the Appellant's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the requirement that the Board delay issuing a decision until the period to request to switch dockets elapses pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900 (c). 38 U.S.C.§ 7107 (a)(2).

1. Entitlement to recognition of the Appellant as a substitute claimant.

2. Entitlement to accrued benefits.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5121A, when a claimant dies during the pendency of any claims, an eligible person may file a request to substitute as the claimant for the purpose of processing any pending claims to completion. The request must be submitted within one year of the claimant's death. Substitution differs from a traditional "accrued benefits" claim in that additional evidence and argument may be added to the claim file following the death of the claimant. Cf. 38 U.S.C. § 5121; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000. 

Accrued benefits are those benefits to which an individual was entitled at the time of death under an existing rating or based on evidence in the file at the date of death, and which were due and unpaid at the time of death. See 38 U.S.C. § 5121(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000(a). 

Again, as noted in the beginning, there were pending claims at the time of E.K.'s death. The Appellant did file his substitution request and claim for accrued benefits within one year.

Substitution is allowed for a claimant who falls within any of the categories specified in 38 U.S.C. § 5121(a)(1)-(6).  In this matter the Appellant is the son of E.K and the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5121 states that upon the death of a widow or remarried surviving spouse, the children of the deceased Veteran would be next in line. 

The term "child" is defined, in pertinent part, as a person who is unmarried and (1) under the age of 18; or (2) became permanently incapable of self-support before the age of 18; or (3) under the age of 23 and pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution. See 38 U.S.C. § 101(4)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.57; Burris v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 348, 352-53 (2001); Nolan v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 340 (2006).

In all other cases, eligibility of substitution or entitlement to accrued benefits may be met as necessary to reimburse the person who bore the expense of last sickness and burial. 38 U.S.C. § 5121(a)(6); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000(a)(5).

In this matter, the evidence does not in any way suggest that the Appellant has qualified at any time during this appeal as a "child" of the Veteran. In this matter, the Appellant is the adult son of the Veteran, who is over the age of 18 years and 23 years. He was over the age of 18 and 23 years when he first filed for benefits. The evidence does not indicate, nor does the Appellant assert, that he was permanently incapable of self-support prior to attaining the age of 18.

Again, another avenue in which the Appellant can be eligible for substitution, or entitled to accrued benefits is through reimbursement of expenses he personally incurred in connection with the last sickness and burial of E.K. The Appellant was provided opportunities to provide information pertaining to any expenses he may have incurred for his mother's last sickness and burial. 

In September 2021, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 21-601, Application for Reimbursement from Accrued Amounts Due a Deceased Beneficiary. The Appellant listed funeral expenses and nursing home expenses. However, the Appellant did not attach or include corroborating documents, such as receipts or an accounting statement. In April 2023, the Appellant submitted another VA Form 21-601. There were no expenses reported on that application. 

In July 2024, the Board remanded in order for the AOJ to provide notice regarding how to establish entitlement to substitution, as a person who bore expenses of E.K.'s last sickness. It was directed to request from the Appellant specific documentation demonstrating that he bore the expenses, such as financial transaction records, checking account statements, or other banking and financial documentation. See July 2024 BVA Decision.

In July 2024, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 21-601. He did not report any expenses. In the application, the Appellant expressed seeking accrued benefits, indicating that his mother was owed retroactive benefits due to being entitled to an earlier effective date for DIC benefits.

In August 2024, the AOJ sent the Appellant a notice informing him that additional evidence was needed from him. The AOJ also attached a VA Form 21-601. The instruction sheet for the VA Form 21-601 provided information pertaining to what evidence was needed in order to establish reimbursement for last illness and burial expenses of a beneficiary. See August 5103/DTA Letter. As the record currently stands, this information has not been submitted.

The Board notes that the August 2024 notice letter discussed entitlement to accrued benefits and does not explicitly address eligibility for substitution. However, as noted above, the avenue that the Appellant could be recognized as a substitute claimant is to be the person who bore the expenses of the last sickness and burial. The AOJ provided the necessary notice pertaining to establishing such. Additionally, statements from the Appellant indicate that he is also seeking entitlement to accrued benefits. The Board finds that the AOJ provided sufficient notice.

The Board acknowledges the Appellant's contention that since he had his mother as a dependent on his own award of VA disability compensation, he should be entitled to accrued benefits, and eligible to be recognized as a substitute claimant. However, as previously outlined, the laws and regulations do not allow for the award of accrued benefits or recognition as a substitute claimant based on the deceased claimant being a dependent on an award of VA disability compensation of the requesting appellant. Although the Appellant is also a veteran, this matter derives from his father. Therefore, any VA matters particular to him, such as dependents on his VA disability compensation award, would not be relevant in determining whether he is a proper substitute in the pending claims concerning his parents. They are separate matters, not reliant or influential on each other.  

The Board is without the authority to disregard the applicable law, notwithstanding any extenuating circumstances that may have existed at the relevant time in question. Congress did not enact any exceptions to the above-discussed legal provisions that would permit a grant of the requested benefit. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104; Burris v. Wilkie, 888 F.3d 1352, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that "§ 503 provides the Secretary with the authority to grant the precise relief that Appellants request here [payment of moneys], and the Secretary has not delegated that authority").

The Board is truly sympathetic to the Appellant's claim, sincerely thanks him for his service and offers its condolences for his loss. However, the Board is bound by the relevant laws and regulations governing the eligibility criteria for substitution and entitlement to accrued benefits. Therefore, entitlement to the recognition of the Appellant as substitute claimant, and entitlement to accrued benefits must be denied.
