ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to cochlea vestibular system damage, with obesity as an intermediary step, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is proximately due to service-connected cochlea vestibular system damage, with obesity as an intermediary step.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to service-connected cochlea vestibular system damage, with obesity as an intermediary step, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran has active service from December 1993 to September 1995 and August 2005 to September 2006 and other periods of National Guard service. 

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA was implemented effective February 19, 2019 and automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

The rating decision was issued after the implementation of AMA. A July 2024 VA Form 10182 was received. Thus, this decision is drafted in accordance with AMA. 

The Veteran elected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (07/03/2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement).    

Under the AMA, when a claimant seeks appellate review through the Board's Direct Review docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Here that date is March 12, 2014 (03/12/2024 Notification Letter).

In general, the Board is bound by favorable findings in the Rating Decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).   

In this case, favorable findings include the Veteran's diagnosis with obstructive sleep apnea and exposure to TERA. The AOJ also confirmed the Veteran's years of service (3/11/2024 Rating Decision - Narrative, pg. 16).    

    

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

The Veteran claimed entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (08/25/2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim).

During his September 2023 VA examination for sleep apnea, the Veteran explained that he has had difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep from his service-connected vestibular hearing loss. He states during the recovery period of that disability he gained weight due to his inability to remain physically fit. He was informed by his doctor that his weight gain contributed to his sleep apnea. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a). Secondary service connection may be established for a nonservice-connected disability which is aggravated by a service-connected disability. In such an instance, the Veteran may be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (b); see Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

Here, the element of current disability has been met by favorable findings discussed above.

The record confirms that service connection is in effect for left ear profound sensorineural hearing loss and cochleo-vestibular system damage (claimed as severe dizziness (03/11/2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet).

The Board also finds a current diagnosis and service connection for a primary disability is confirmed. Thus, the Board turns to the question of nexus, that is whether the evidence of record establishes a link between the Veteran's service-connected disabilities and his diagnosed sleep apnea, to include with obesity as an intermediary step. 

In this regard, the Board notes that in Walsh v. Wilkie, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held, that the Board needs to consider the obesity-intermediate step theorem predicated on aggravation where appropriate. Thus, the Court held that proper interpretation of G.C. Prec. Op. 1-2017 requires consideration of both causation and aggravation in its analytical framework: (1) whether the service-connected disability caused the veteran to become obese; (2) if so, whether the obesity as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing the current disability; and (3) whether the current disability would not have occurred but for obesity caused by the service-connected disability. If these questions are answered in the affirmative, then the current disability may be service connected on a secondary basis. Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020).

On the question of nexus, the Board turns to the medical evidence of record.

Review of the medical evidence of record reveals probative evidence in favor of the Veterans claim. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in September 2023 for sleep apnea (10/10/2023 C&P Exam). 

After an in-person examination, review of the records and VA e-folder, and consideration of the Veteran's contentions as to the onset and progression of his sleeping issues, the examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of sleep apnea.

In the remarks section of the examination report, the examiner explained that sleep apnea is commonly brought on due to initial weight gain, which the veteran had due to his service-connected disability related to his vestibular injuries which likely caused his initial diagnosis of sleep apnea in 2009 (10/10/2023 C&P Exam, pg. 4).

The Board acknowledges the negative nexus opinion, weighing against the Veteran's sleep apnea being at least as likely as not due to his conceded TERA exposure (09/28/2023 VA Examination, pg. 4). This negative nexus opinion considers separate factors and does not contradict or outweigh the other opinion of record.

After weighing the medical evidence, the Board finds the positive VA opinions from September 2023 to be the most relevant and probative opinion of record. The opinion considers the Veteran's relevant medical history and contains clear conclusions with supporting data and a reasoned medical explanation connecting his service-connected disability to and obesity, and obesity to his diagnosed sleep apnea. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

Having resolved reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, to include as secondary to cochlea vestibular system damage, with obesity as an intermediary step, is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
