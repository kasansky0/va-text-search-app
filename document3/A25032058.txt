ORDER

A 20 percent rating, but not higher, for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) is granted.

A separate 20 percent rating, but not higher, for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (external popliteal nerve) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right lower extremity (RLE) peripheral neuropathy manifests as moderate incomplete paralysis of the right sciatic nerve, and moderate incomplete paralysis of the external popliteal nerve, without diminished or absent muscle strength, absent deep tendon reflexes or muscle atrophy.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a 20 percent rating for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.123, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

2. The criteria for a 20 percent rating for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (external popliteal nerve) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.123, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8521.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2012 to November 2015.

The September 2023 rating decision granted service connection for RLE radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve, rated at 10 percent, effective April 25, 2023. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve).

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when assigning disability ratings. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).  When the appeal arises from an initial assigned rating, consideration must be given to whether staged ratings should be assigned to compensate entitlement to a higher rating at any point during the pendency of the claim.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  However, staged ratings are also appropriate in any increased rating claim in which distinct time periods with different ratable symptoms can be identified.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The rating of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  However, that does not preclude the assignment of separate ratings for separate and distinct symptomatology where none of the symptomatology justifying a rating under one diagnostic code is duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology justifying a rating under another diagnostic code.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994).

Disease of the peripheral nerves of the lower extremities are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8510 to 8719.

Under Diagnostic Code 8520, for paralysis of the sciatic nerve, a 10 percent rating is assigned for mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis.  A 40 percent rating is assigned for moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. A 60 percent rating is assigned for severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve with marked muscular atrophy.  A maximum 80 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, characterized by the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

Under Diagnostic Code 8521 for external popliteal nerve, mild incomplete paralysis is assigned a 10 percent rating.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis.  Severe incomplete paralysis is assigned a rating for 30 percent.  Finally, a 40 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis, which is described as foot drop and slight droop of first phalanges of all toes, cannot dorsiflex the foot, extension (dorsal flexion) of proximal phalanges of toes lost; abduction of foot lost, adduction weakened; anesthesia covers entire dorsum of foot and toes.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8521 (external popliteal nerve nerve).

Under Diagnostic Code 8522 for musculocutaneous nerve, mild incomplete paralysis is assigned a noncompensable rating.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis. Severe incomplete paralysis is assigned a rating for 20 percent.  Finally, a 30 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis, which is described as eversion of foot weakened.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8522 (musculocutaneous nerve).

Under Diagnostic Code 8523 for anterior tibial nerve, mild incomplete paralysis is assigned a noncompensable rating.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis. Severe incomplete paralysis is assigned a rating for 20 percent.  Finally, a 30 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis, which is described as dorsal flexion of foot lost.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8523 (anterior tibial nerve).

Under Diagnostic Code 8526 for anterior crural nerve, mild incomplete paralysis is assigned a 10 percent rating.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis. Severe incomplete paralysis is assigned a rating for 30 percent.  Finally, a 40 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis, which is described as paralysis of quadriceps extensor muscles.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8526 (anterior crural nerve).

The Board notes that the term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  Id.  Words such as "mild," "moderate," "severe," and "marked" are not defined in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities and the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.

When the involvement is only sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  In rating peripheral nerve disability, neuritis-characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, at times excruciating, is to be rated on the scale provided for injury of the nerve involved, with a maximum equal to severe, incomplete paralysis.  The maximum rating to be assigned for neuritis not characterized by organic changes referred to in this section will be that for moderate incomplete paralysis, or with sciatic nerve involvement, for moderately severe incomplete paralysis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.123.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in June 2023 for his peripheral nerve conditions.  At the examination, the Veteran reported that since 2015, he has experienced numbness (especially in his right foot) and tingling down his right lower extremity, along with radiating pain down the right lower extremity that has progressively worsened since onset.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have any symptoms attributable to any peripheral nerve conditions.  The Veteran's muscle strength testing was normal.  The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy.  No trophic changes were reported.  The Veteran's gait was normal.  Right foot/toes sensation testing for light touch was decreased.  The examiner described moderate incomplete paralysis in the right sciatic nerve, and moderate incomplete paralysis of the external popliteal nerve.  The Veteran stated, doctors have not treated his nerve related symptoms yet.  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence supports the grant of a 20 percent rating, but not higher, for right lower extremity radiculopathy (sciatic nerve) and the grant of a separate 20 percent rating, but not higher, for right lower extremity radiculopathy (external popliteal nerve).  

In making these determinations, the Board relies on the June 2023 examination report that shows the Veteran had moderate incomplete paralysis in the right sciatic nerve and moderate incomplete paralysis of the external popliteal (common peroneal) nerve.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8520, 8521.  Additional objective neurological findings showed that the Veteran had normal deep tendon reflex testing, decreased light touch testing in the lower leg/ankle, normal strength testing, no muscle atrophy and no tropic changes in the right lower extremity.  Therefore, 20 percent ratings for the sciatic and external popliteal nerves are warranted throughout the appeal period.

The Board has considered whether higher ratings are appropriate but finds that the Veteran's symptoms have not manifested to such severity, frequency, or duration as to warrant higher ratings in this case.  As the Veteran's impairment is almost completely sensory in nature, with only one isolated finding of decreased reflexes, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected radiculopathy, right lower extremity most nearly approximates 20 percent ratings under Diagnostic Codes 8520 and 8521.
