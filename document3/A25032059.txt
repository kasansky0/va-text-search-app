ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, and finding the evidence to be least approximately balanced, it is at least as likely as not that his current tinnitus is etiologically related to acoustic trauma sustained in active service.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, and finding the evidence to be at least approximately balanced, it is at least as likely as not that his current bilateral hearing loss is etiologically related to acoustic trauma sustained in active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Navy from August 1988 to September 1990 and from October 1990 to June 1996.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), that as relevant here, confirmed and continued prior denials of service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus.

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issues of entitlement to service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus, then most recently addressed in a September 2022 rating decision. In September 2023, the RO issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 RO supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the RO issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board may not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus

Service connection may be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Generally, to establish service connection, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by his senses. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a). VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed Cir. 2009).

The VA has established certain rules and presumptions for chronic diseases, such as organic diseases of the nervous system like tinnitus. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013). With chronic diseases shown as such in service to permit a finding of service connected, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, chronic diseases are presumed to have been incurred in service if they are manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

Given that tinnitus is a disability for which lay evidence is competent, the Board must weigh that evidence against the other evidence of record in making its determination regarding whether the Veteran's tinnitus is service connected. See Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271-72 (2015) (citing Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2010); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with a veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence weighs persuasively against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Turning to the case, the Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus. He asserts that his hearing loss and tinnitus were caused by in-service acoustic trauma. As the analysis is similar, the issues will be discussed together.

Favorable findings from the September 2023 decision on appeal include current diagnoses of bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, confirmed by August 2023 VA examination, and that the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease onset during the Veteran's service based on noise exposure being conceded by Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of Radiological Control Officer. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the first and second elements of service connection have been met.

The Veteran has maintained that his in-service acoustic trauma resulted in hearing loss and tinnitus. See VA 21-4138 forms dated in April 2023. 

As to the final criteria, a nexus, VA opinions were obtained in August 2023. Negative nexus opinions were proffered for both hearing loss and tinnitus. As rationale, the examiner mainly relied on a lack of evidence of hearing loss in service treatment records (STRs). The opinions are explained by the notation that "there is no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds beyond test variability from entrance (7/25/1988) to separation (6/26/1996), which is objective evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty from conceded noise ... no report of complaints/treatment for hearing loss [and] .... tinnitus in STRs or ... during service on entrance and/or separation examinations." The Board notes that a lack of in-service evidence alone is not a sufficient rationale to support a negative opinion. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

The record also includes private medical opinions dated in April 2023, that indicate a positive nexus between the Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus with the conceded in-service noise exposure. The private opinions are based on review of available medical history and treatment regarding the Veteran as well as his lay statements regarding the claimed conditions. The Board notes that the private medical opinions do acknowledge that there is a lack of reference to hearing loss and/or tinnitus in service. Nevertheless, the private opinions indicate that it is as likely as not that the claimed hearing loss and tinnitus are due to and/or otherwise related to "military acoustic trauma during active-duty military service."

The Board finds the April 2023 private medical opinions and the August 2023 VA examination opinion, relevant and probative. While the VA examination tends against the claim, the private medical opinions, which note consideration of the Veteran's credible reports regarding his hearing loss and tinnitus, favors the claims.

In review of the evidence, the Veteran is competent to report the symptoms he experienced as associated with the claimed conditions. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002) (holding that tinnitus is a type of disorder that is capable of lay observation). It has been conceded that the Veteran was exposed acoustic trauma during service based on his MOS, and that he has current bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus diagnoses, all which together with the April 2023 private medical opinions are sufficient to establish the nexus required to grant service connection for the claimed conditions. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); see also Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271-72 (2015).

Accordingly, looking at the evidence as a whole and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus are related to his conceded exposure to acoustic trauma during active-duty service. Thus, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus is granted. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
