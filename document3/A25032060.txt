ORDER

A 10 percent rating, but not greater, for scar, status post pilonidal cyst excision (claimed as scars), is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the persuasive evidence of record shows that the Veteran has one status post pilonidal cyst excision scar which is painful.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for a 10 percent disability rating, but no greater, for the Veteran's service-connected scar, status post pilonidal cyst excision have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2005 to February 2011.

In August 2024 Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for scar, status post pilonidal cyst excision (claimed as scars).

The Veteran contends that a compensable rating is warranted for his scar, status post pilonidal cyst excision.  See May 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  The Veteran's scar, status post pilonidal cyst excision is rated noncompensable, effective July 17, 2022, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.  

In general, scars are rated under one of four diagnostic codes: 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7804.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Diagnostic Code 7800, which provides ratings for scars or other disfigurement of the head, face or neck, is not applicable in this case because the Veteran's only service-connected scar is on his posterior trunk.  Id.

Diagnostic Code 7801 provides ratings for burn scars or scars due to other causes, not of the head, face or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  A 10 percent rating is assigned where such scars cover an area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm.) but less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.).  A 20 percent rating is assigned where they cover an area or areas of at least 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.) but less than 72 square inches (465 sq. cm.).  A 30 percent rating is assigned where they cover an area or areas of at least 72 square inches (465 sq. cm.) but less than 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.).  A maximum 40 percent rating is assigned where they cover an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Diagnostic Code 7802 provides a maximum 10 percent rating for burn scars or scars due to other causes, not of the head, face or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  The 10 percent rating is assigned where such scars cover an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  Id.

Diagnostic Code 7804 provides ratings for scars that are unstable or painful.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for one or two scars that are unstable or painful, a 20 percent rating is assigned for three or four unstable or painful scars, and a maximum 30 percent rating is assigned for five or more unstable or painful scars.  Id.  An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of skin covering over the scar. Diagnostic Code 7804, Note (1).  If a scar is both painful and unstable, another 10 percent is added to the evaluation.  Id., Note (2).

In July 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his scar.  The Veteran was found to have one scar on his posterior trunk, measuring 6 centimeters x 1 centimeter.  

In the Veteran's May 2023 statement, he reported aching pain when he puts pressure on the scar.  The examiner noted that his back is located on the tailbone, lower back.  He stated that lying on back and prolonged sitting cause a burning sensation at the site of the scar.

The Board finds that there is an approximate balance of evidence that the Veteran's scar, status post pilonidal cyst excision is painful.  The Veteran is competent to describe observable symptoms such as pain and he has reported twice that he experiences pain and discomfort in his scar, status post pilonidal cyst excision.  Though the scar was not found to be painful at his July 2023 VA examination, the Board does not find this evidence to be sufficient to deny a compensable rating in light of his May 2023 statement reporting painful scar symptoms.  When there is an approximate balance of evidence, reasonable doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor.  Accordingly, the Board grants a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7802 for a painful status post pilonidal cyst excision scar of the posterior trunk.
