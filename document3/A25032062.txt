ORDER

An initial rating of 10 percent is granted for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) from August 29, 2019, to December 19, 2022.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's GERD was manifested by pyrosis, regurgitation, and pain during the period on appeal prior to December 20, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial rating of 10 percent for the period prior to December 20, 2022, for GERD are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7399-7346 (2023).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from May 1980 to February 2000. A supplemental claim decision was issued in the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system, by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in April 2023. The Veteran requested higher-level review (HLR) of that decision in October 2023. In February 2024, the AOJ issued an HLR decision, which is the decision on appeal. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 supplemental claim decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. Regarding the issue the Board is remanding, any such evidence will be considered by the AOJ on remand. 

Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent is granted for GERD from August 29, 2019, to December 19, 2022.

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects their ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing their symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.10. If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. However, where an increase in the disability rating, rather than the propriety of the initial rating, is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance, and past medical reports should not take precedence over current findings. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Regardless of whether an appeal stems from disagreement with the initial rating assigned following an award of service connection or from disagreement with the rating assigned following a claim for increase, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007) (citing Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999)).

The period for appellate consideration is from the date of the award of service connection on August 29, 2019. 

The Veteran's GERD is rated by analogy under DC 7346 as noncompensable from August 29, 2019, and to December 19, 2022. The Veteran's GERD is rated as 10 percent disabling from December 20, 2022 through the rest of the review period, which the Board notes predates regulatory amendments that took effect in May 2024. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. 

Under the applicable pre-amendment criteria, a 10 percent rating was warranted under DC 7346 for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity. A 30 percent rating was warranted for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. Lastly, a 60 percent rating was warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (2023).

Turning to the evidence of record, a November 2019 VA examination showed a diagnosis of GERD and hiatal hernia. The examiner indicated that the Veteran reported symptoms of chest pain, regurgitation, and bloating, which were temporarily relieved with TUMS. She noted her symptoms were better controlled a few years prior when she was taking Zantac. The examiner then stated that the Veteran had current symptoms of pyrosis and reflux.  

The Veteran did not report nausea, vomiting, or persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia or substernal or arm or shoulder pain, nor was there an indication from the information contained in the examination report that the condition was productive of considerable impairment of health. The Veteran also did not show material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia. The examiner did not indicate that the Veteran had sleep disturbance. 

In a July 2020 statement, the Veteran reported that she has symptoms of GERD that include nausea, heartburn, and a feeling of food coming back up into her throat at least once a day. She stated she must use over the counter TUMS and Rolaids about four to five times a week to help control the severe heartburn, but that the symptoms return soon after she uses the medicine. She reports she must avoid certain foods, watch the time of day when she eats, and not lie down soon after eating. She stated she was unable to sleep more than 6 hours straight due to being awakened by her GERD symptoms, and that lack of sleep causes difficulty concentrating, daytime fatigue, trouble thinking, mood changes, irritability, and depressed mood. 

During a December 2022 VA examination, the Veteran explained that in 2017 she was having heartburn and bubbling of the stomach and was advised to take Prevacid as needed. She stated her condition had stayed the same since then, and that currently she experienced heartburn and sometimes felt like her food was stuck in her throat. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's disability was treated with Prevacid and showed symptoms of reflux, regurgitation, and substernal pain. The Veteran had nausea once a year for less than a day. The Veteran was not found to have sleep disturbance or symptoms productive of considerable or severe impairment of health. The Veteran also did not show material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia.

The Board finds that the record is sufficient to establish entitlement to a 10 percent rating for the Veteran's GERD prior to December 20, 2022. The November 2019 VA examiner only noted symptoms of pyrosis and reflux on examination, which only constitutes one of the symptoms listed in the 30 percent criteria. However, the examiner noted current reports of regurgitation and chest pain. The Board finds that the Veteran is competent to report such symptoms, and the examiner's exclusion of those symptoms from the examination findings is unexplained. As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's GERD was manifested by pyrosis, regurgitation, and pain during the period on appeal prior to December 20, 2022, and a 10 percent rating is granted from August 29, 2019, to December 19, 2022. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent is addressed in the remand portion of this decision, below.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD is remanded.

The Board must remand an appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A if the error occurred prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. This claim must be remanded for correction of the following pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The AOJ granted service connection for GERD and assigned the initial rating in April 2023. Review of the record reflects the Veteran was receiving ongoing VA treatment during the claim period. However, the most recent CAPRI records associated with the file at the time of the April 2023 decision were obtained in September 2022 and date through August 2022, only. There is no indication the AOJ sought updated VA treatment records prior to rating the Veteran's GERD in April 2023. On remand, this pre-decisional duty to assist error must be corrected by obtaining updated VA treatment records.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:
