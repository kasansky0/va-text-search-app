ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 2011 to January 2015. 

In July 2024, the Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision which addressed the above-noted issue.  That same month, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), wherein he sought to appeal the claim in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) System.  He selected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the RO issued the July 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to his active service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Duties to Notify and Assist

VA has a duty to notify and assist veterans in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.326(a).  Because the Board is granting the Veteran's claim, any error committed with respect to this claim is harmless. 

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d). 

Burden of Proof

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary.  The Secretary shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary.  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). 

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus, which he contends is etiologically related to his military service.  The medical evidence confirms the Veteran has been diagnosed with bilateral tinnitus.  The central issue that must be resolved at this time is whether the Veteran's current disability originated during service or is otherwise related to service. 

Initially, the Board notes the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not show a diagnosis of tinnitus in service.  However, the Board observes the Veteran's DD-214 shows he was a helicopter repairman in service.  The U.S. Army has acknowledged this military occupational specialty (MOS) carries a high probability for exposure to acoustic trauma.

On VA examination in November 2023, the examiner concluded the Veteran's reports of ringing in his ears were not consistent with tinnitus.  The examiner failed to explain why this was so.  The examiner further concluded the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely as not caused by or the result of his military service.  In this respect the examiner indicated the Veteran's tinnitus was more likely associated with a non-auditory disorder.  Again, the examiner failed to explain this conclusion, and also contradicted his prior diagnosis assessment.  For these reasons, the Board has afforded the November 2023 examiner's conclusions little probative value. 

Notwithstanding the medical opinion provided by the November 2023 VA examiner, the Veteran has reported he was exposed to significant noise exposure during his period of active duty, which is certainly consistent with his duties as a helicopter repairman.  Further, the Veteran has indicated that he initially noticed his tinnitus during his time in the Army, and that his disability has persisted since that time.

In this case, the Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The evaluation of evidence generally involves a 3-step inquiry.  First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source.  The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (Observing that once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible).  The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the proffered evidence in light of the entirety of the record.  The Board also notes that under certain circumstances, lay evidence may be sufficient to establish a nexus.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). 

Lay evidence has been found to be competent with regard to a disease that has "unique and readily identifiable features" that are "capable of lay observation."  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308-09 (2007); see also Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002) (providing that a veteran's testimony regarding tinnitus is competent evidence, as "ringing in the ears is capable of lay observation.").

Here, the Veteran has reported that he experienced ringing of the ears during service, which has persisted since.  The Board finds the Veteran competent to report his hearing limitations.  It is generally within the competence of a lay person to identify and observe the effect of a disability under the ordinary conditions of daily life.  Many symptoms are readily observable by a lay person.  Accordingly, the lay evidence provided by the Veteran is unquestionably competent evidence.  In this respect, the Board finds the Veteran's own reports of experiencing ringing of the ears to be at least as probative as the above-noted VA examiner's findings.

As previously noted, this appeal turns on whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current disability and his exposure to acoustic trauma in service.  The Veteran has competently and credibly reported that he experienced tinnitus in service.  Accordingly, a nexus to service is established.  

In sum, the Board is satisfied that the evidence supporting a nexus between the Veteran's currently diagnosed disability and his in-service acoustic trauma is at least in equipoise with the evidence against a nexus.  Therefore, the Veteran is entitled to service connection for his tinnitus.
