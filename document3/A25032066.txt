ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's prior military occupational specialty (MOS) as Machinery Repairman had a high probability of hazardous noise exposure.

2. The Veteran has a current diagnosis for tinnitus.

3. The Veteran has asserted his current ringing in his ears is related to his MOS as a Machinery Repairman.

4. The competent evidence of record, while showing the Veteran has some hearing loss, otherwise persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hearing loss within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309

2. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1998 to July 2001, and in the Navy Reserves from July 2001 to October 2005. The Board is grateful to the Veteran for his honorable service.

In May 2024, the Veteran timely appealed the May 2024 AMA determination, which denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss, and the February 2024 AMA determination, which denied service connection for tinnitus, to the Board and requested Direct Review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AMA determination, for the bilateral hearing loss claim, and at the time of the February 2024 AMA determination, for the tinnitus claim. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

To prevail on a direct service connection claim, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

A disability may be service connected on a secondary basis if it is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury; or, if it is aggravated beyond its natural progress by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b).

The Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ unless rebutted by clear and unmistakable (undebatable) evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

In determining whether service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. That is, the claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in "approximate" balance, i.e., "nearly equal," but does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends that that his tinnitus is related to service.

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus as evidenced by the February 2024 VA examination. Tinnitus is considered an "other organic diseases of the nervous system," which is an enumerated condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Walker, 708 F.3d 1331.

The Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) as a Machinery Repairman had a high probability of hazardous noise exposure.

While no treatment records exist from during the applicable presumptive period, the Board finds that the Veteran continued to experience the same symptoms since service. The Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of ringing in his ears during that period. When the Veteran initially submitted his claim for tinnitus in May 2023, he asserted that his tinnitus was due to his MOS in active service. The Veteran's statements are credible and entitled to probative weight, as they are internally consistent and consistent with other evidence of record.

The February 2024 VA examiner's opinion is not probative as it is based on inaccurate information. The VA examiner's rationale relied upon the Veteran's normal hearing at the examination and stated that the etiology could not be determined without resorting to mere speculation. In fact, the Veteran initially reported in May 2023 that his tinnitus was from his duties as a Machinery Repairman during active service.  

The Board notes that tinnitus is one of the disabilities where service connection can be granted based on credible lay statements of tinnitus symptoms that started in service due to noise exposure associated with the Veteran's military occupation, which continued thereafter. There can be no doubt that further medical inquiry could be undertaken with a view towards development of the claim. However, "if the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt." Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's reports of experiencing continuous symptoms of tinnitus since service is credible. The Board finds the Veteran competent and credible as layman to report when the ringing in his ears started and what preceded it.

Because the Veteran has experienced tinnitus since service, his tinnitus is presumed to be related to service. As such, in resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection for tinnitus is thus granted.

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. 

The Board finds that the evidence does not persuasively demonstrate that the Veteran has a current bilateral hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes, nor has he had one during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

VA has specifically defined the term "disability" for service connection claims involving impaired hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. "[I]mpaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent." 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

With respect to a current disability, in February 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA audiological examination, which reflected the following puretone thresholds, in decibels:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	20	20	20	25	25

LEFT	20	15	25	25	20

The examiner noted that Maryland CNC word list was used and speech recognition score was 100 percent bilaterally. The examiner considered the Veteran's lay statements and his MOS as a Machinery Repairman. The examiner stated the following in regard to a summary of audiologic test results: "[t]he results of pure tone and speech audiometrics indicate normal hearing bilaterally."

These are the only audiometric results of record following which comport with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, and they do not show that the Veteran has a hearing loss disability as defined by the regulation. In addition, none of the other evidence of record reflects diagnosis of current hearing loss disability for VA purposes. 

The Board also acknowledges that the Veteran's noise exposure in service is conceded based on his military occupation specialty (MOS) of a Machinery Repairman. See April 2024 rating decision; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c) (noting the Board is bound by the favorable findings made by the AOJ in the October 2022 rating decision). However, despite noise exposure being conceded, in the absence of a current disability for both ears, the Board finds that service connection cannot be established. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385; Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). The most probative evidence of record, as discussed above, reflects the Veteran has not been shown to have a current disorder of hearing loss in the either ear for VA purposes at any time. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). Accordingly, as the first element of service connection has not been met, the Board need not discuss the remaining criteria for service connection. 

The Board acknowledges that the May 2024 rating decision found that the April 2024 rating decision, which denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss, made an incorrect favorable finding that a nexus had been established between the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and service. Notably, the record lacks a medical nexus between the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and service. See February 2024 VA medical opinion. 

Additionally, the Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report that which he has personally experienced, such as noise exposure and hearing problems. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). But there is a difference between hearing loss and a hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Since the existence of hearing loss disability requires certain specific testing, the Veteran is not competent to establish that he has disability as distinguished from just hearing loss. The competent evidence of record, while showing the Veteran has some hearing loss, otherwise persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hearing loss within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. As such, the Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.

In conclusion, in the absence of a current disability, service connection cannot be established. See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366 (holding that entitlement to service connection requires, among other things, evidence of a current disability); see also Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997). As the evidence weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). 

This decision denying service connection for bilateral hearing loss based on no current disability for VA purposes does not preclude the Veteran from filing a supplemental claim at a later date if his hearing acuity decreases.
