REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2006 to December 2006 and she had subsequent service in the Reserve beginning in February 2008.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  

In May 2024, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) and elected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

1. Entitlement to readjudication of the claim for service connection for bilateral foot calluses.

2. Entitlement to readjudication of the claim for service connection for a cervical spine/neck disability.

3. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a skin disability.

5. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension.

6. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

7. Entitlement to service connection for disorder manifested by abnormal weight loss.

8. Entitlement to service connection for depression.

9. Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis.

10. Entitlement to service connection for headaches.

Under the AMA, a claimant may elect administrative review of an AOJ decision by requesting one of three review options, or lanes: (i) Higher-Level Review by the AOJ; (ii) Supplemental Claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(1).  Once a claimant has filed for review under one of these options, he or she may not choose another lane of review with respect to the same claim or same issue contained within the claim until the higher-level review, supplemental claim, or notice of disagreement is adjudicated, or until the request for higher-level review, supplemental claim, or notice of disagreement is withdrawn.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  In other words, concurrent election, or electing multiple review options simultaneously for the same claim, is prohibited.  See Id.  A claimant may change the review option selected by withdrawing the original request and filing the appropriate application for the requested review option within one year from the date on which VA issued notice of a decision on an issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(e)(1).

Here, the Veteran filed an April 2024 supplemental claim concerning the issues on appeal and then filed a May 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD without first withdrawing the supplemental claim.  Therefore, the VA Form 10182 NOD constitutes an improper concurrent election and must be dismissed as a matter of law.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The Board is aware that a subsequent May 2024 rating decision adjudicated some of these issues and that they are the subject of another VA Form 10182, but this is a separate appeal not currently before the Board.
