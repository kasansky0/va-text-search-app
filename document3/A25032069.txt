ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for tinnitus is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for skin irritation on the foot is dismissed. 

Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for anxiety is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for depression is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) confirmed entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for PTSD and tinnitus in a September 2023 rating decision, which represents a full grant of the benefits sought.

2. To the extent the Veteran sought to appeal the prior denial of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for skin irritation, anxiety, and depression in a March 2018 rating decision, his July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), was received more than one year after March 2018 rating decisions.  Therefore, the Notice of Disagreement is untimely.  No good cause has been shown that would permit the Board to extend the filing period, and the Board did not waive (implicitly or explicitly) the timeliness of a Notice of Disagreement.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Appellant served on active duty from August 2008 to July 2011.  

The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for PTSD and tinnitus. The Veteran indicated that these issues were most recently addressed in a March 2018 rating decision.  In September 2023, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which confirmed the Veteran's entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for PTSD and tinnitus.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  He identified the issues of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for PTSD, tinnitus, skin irritation, anxiety, and depression and noted the date of decision as March 7, 2018.  The Board will liberally construe the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement and assume that the Veteran's sought to appeal the September 2023 rating decision with regards to PTSD and tinnitus.  

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for PTSD.

2. Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for tinnitus.

The Board notes that the Veteran was first granted entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for PTSD and tinnitus in a March 2018 rating decision.  In a November 2021 rating decision, the AOJ again confirmed entitlement to treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for PTSD.  In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for PTSD and tinnitus.  In September 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which confirmed the Veteran's entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for PTSD and tinnitus.  

Upon review of the record, it appears the Veteran is attempting to have his character of discharge reviewed in order to obtain compensation or pension benefits.  See March 2022 HLR Informal Conference Worksheet.  In a September 2012 administrative decision, VA determined that the Veteran's service from August 28, 2008, to July 21, 2001, was under other than honorable conditions for VA purposes.  Thus, VA found that the Veteran was only entitled to health-care benefits authorized under 38 USC Chapter 17.  

However, the issue of character of discharge is not presently within the Board's jurisdiction.  The Veteran has been advised by VA several times that in order for VA to reconsider the matter of character of discharge, the Veteran must file the appropriate claim form and include specific language regarding character of discharge.  See October 2018 VA Letter; March 2022 HLR Informal Conference Worksheet, December 2022 VA Letter.  Nevertheless, the Veteran has not taken the appropriate steps to request VA to reconsider his character of discharge, and the issue is not properly before the Board.  

Based on the foregoing, the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for these issues are moot as the benefits sought on appeal are already in effect.  See Baughman v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 563, 566 (1991).  Accordingly, there remains no question of law or fact for the Board to resolve, and these issues are dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5), 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

3. Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for skin irritation on the foot is dismissed. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for anxiety is dismissed.

5. Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for depression is dismissed.

Although the Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction due to an untimely VA Form 21-0958, Notice of Disagreement (as to legacy-era rating decisions), an untimely VA Form 10182 (as to AMA-era rating decisions), or submission of the incorrect form to appeal a given rating decision (e.g., submission of VA Form 21-0958 to appeal an AMA-era rating decision), it may dismiss the appeal due to non-jurisdictional reasons, such as a procedural defect, where the claimant did not substantially comply with proper claims processing rules.  See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (stating VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings, but a failure to follow claims processing does not affect the Board's jurisdiction); see also Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021).

In a March 2018 rating decision, the Veteran was denied entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 USC Chapter 17 for skin irritation, anxiety, and depression.  A March 2018 Notification Letter was sent to the Veteran informing him of this decision.  In this case, to the extent that the Veteran may have sought to appeal the AOJ's prior denial in the March 2018 rating decision, he did not comply with the claims processing rules for the appeal.   In the March 2018 Notification Letter, the AOJ notified the Veteran that if he disagreed with the decision, he must complete and return VA Form 21-0958, Notice of Disagreement, within one year from the date of the notification letter.  

The Veteran did not file a Notice of Disagreement within the requisite period but rather raised the issue in a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  The Board finds that the Veteran was adequately informed as to how and by when to appeal the March 2018 rating decision.   Thus, any presumed attempt to appeal the March 2018 rating decision is considered untimely.

The Board has also considered the applicability of any waiver that would permit extending the filing period but finds no such evidence.  See Hall v. McDonough, at 332 (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45 (2009) (VA may implicitly or explicitly waive any issue of timeliness in the filing of a Substantive Appeal).  The Veteran did not file a motion for an extension and has not provided good cause to extend the filing period, and no other waiver is applicable here.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) (Time limits within which claimants or beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown.); 38 C.F.R. § 19.53.  ("request for such an extension must be in writing and must be made prior to expiration of the time limit for filing the Substantive Appeal or the response to the Supplemental Statement of the Case.").

Finally, the Board has also considered whether it waived its right to enforce the filing deadline by virtue of docketing the appeal.  See Percy v. Shinseki, at 46-47 (holding that VA waived any objection to the timeliness of the legacy substantive appeal because "VA consistently treated th[e] matter as if it was part of the timely filed Substantive Appeal[] "for over five years.").  Following the Veteran's filing of his July 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Board sent a letter acknowledging receipt of the Notice of Disagreement and placement of the appeal on the Direct Review docket, as elected on his Notice of Disagreement.  The Board finds that this letter acknowledging receipt and the mere administrative act of assigning the attempted appeal a docket, in and of itself, does not constitute a waiver of timeliness by the Board.  Indeed, whether the Board has waived any objection the timeliness of a Notice of Disagreement should be based on all facts and circumstances of that case.  Id. at 46 (discussing VA's actions in that case in finding VA had treated the substantive appeal as timely filed).

In this case, unlike the circumstances of Percy, the Board did not continuously "engage in substantive and procedural development" of the appeal.  See id.  The Board took no actions that could lead the Veteran to believe that the merits of the case were being examined and developed in a substantive way.  The Board's notice of receipt of the Veteran's purported appeal did not convey any intent to forego reliance on the laws applicable to docketing.  Thus, the Board finds that mere sending of the docketing letter did not constitute a waiver of the timeliness requirements for the Notice of Disagreement.

Based on the foregoing, as no good cause has been shown and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made as to the timeliness of the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement, (to the extent the Veteran potentially sought to appeal the March 2018 rating decision), the Board finds that the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement was, and remains, untimely.  The present appeal for entitlement to service connection for claustrophobia must be dismissed based on the Veteran's failure to comply with the claims processing rules.
