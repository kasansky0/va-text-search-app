ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is granted.

Entitlement to an initial increased rating above 10 percent for tinnitus, to include on an extraschedular basis, during the review period (from May 30, 2023, through May 2, 2024) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's bilateral SNHL was at least as likely as not caused by exposure to in-service hazardous noise.

2. Throughout the review period, the Veteran has been in receipt of the maximum schedular disability rating for his tinnitus; the Veteran's disability picture is not so unusual or exceptional for VA purposes such that referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral SNHL have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.385.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an initial increased rating above 10 percent for tinnitus, to include on an extraschedular basis, during the review period (from May 30, 2023, through May 2, 2024) have not been met.  38?U.S.C. §§?1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§?3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.25, 4.26, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.87, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from January 1970 to November 1971 and August 1980 to November 1998.  The Board thanks the Veteran for his service to our country. 

In a December 1, 1999, Rating Decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), in pertinent part, denied entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and entitlement to service connection for tinnitus; on December 30, 1999, the AOJ mailed a notification letter containing appeal rights, but the Veteran did not timely appeal and the December 1999 Rating Decision became final.  On May 30, 2023, VA received a VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim Application) initiating the claims herein.  In an October 19, 2023, Rating Decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, denied readjudication of entitlement to service connection for hearing loss (finding that no new and relevant evidence was submitted).  On October 24, 2023, VA received a VA Form 20-0996 (Request for Higher-Level Review [HLR]) for the October 2023 Rating Decision.  In a November 25, 2023, HLR Rating Decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, found that it committed a duty-to-assist error in its prior adjudication of the hearing loss claim; on November 25, 2023, the AOJ issued a VA Form 20-0999 (HLR Return) for the October 2023 Rating Decision.  In a May 2, 2024, Rating Decision (on appeal), the AOJ: granted service connection for tinnitus (and assigned a 10 percent rating effective May 30, 2023); and denied entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  On May 14, 2024, VA received a VA Form 10182 electing the Board's review of the claims herein under its Direct Review Docket pursuant to the modernized review system under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA); in the June 2024 Brief, the Veteran, through his representative, clarified that he was seeking service connection for bilateral hearing loss and an increased rating, on an extraschedular basis, for tinnitus.  38?C.F.R. §?20.301.

Applicable Review Periods and Evidentiary Windows

The review period and the evidentiary window are distinct concepts in AMA that are not interchangeable (the review period is limited to the period considered by the AOJ [i.e., ends at the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal]; the evidentiary window is the time which evidence may be submitted and considered for the issue on appeal).  The Direct Review Docket only permits the Board to review the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision(s) on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the VA Form 10182; in this case, the Veteran has not filed such a request. ?Id; 38 C.F.R. § 20.301; Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).  When the decision on appeal is a HLR decision, then the review period and evidentiary window end on the date of the decision prior to the HLR decision; however, once a HLR decision finds a duty-to-assist error and the AOJ issues a VA Form 20-0999 (HLR Return), the HLR for that issue is complete and the next Rating Decision issued is not considered a HLR Rating Decision for purposes of determining review periods and evidentiary windows.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(f). 

Regarding the appeal herein, the review periods span from the date of the claims (May 30, 2023) through the date the AOJ issued the decision on appeal (May 2, 2024); the evidentiary windows are limited to evidence associated with the claims file on or before the date the AOJ issued the decision on appeal (May 2, 2024).  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. §?3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  Cook, supra.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral SNHL

Direct service connection may be warranted if the evidence shows: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Although a competent medical opinion is generally required to establish etiology, competent and credible lay evidence of chronicity and continuity of symptomology may also establish etiology.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d); Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a Veteran's disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki,?24?Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau,?supra.  In this case, the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran has the medical background necessary to opine regarding symptoms or diagnoses that are not lay observable; however, as a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report lay-observable symptoms and functional loss because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses.  Layno,?supra.  Lay evidence may establish a diagnosis of a simple medical condition, a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or symptoms that later support a diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau, supra.

The Veteran generally contends that his bilateral SNHL began during and has continued since service as a result of exposure to significant hazardous noise.  See October 2023 VA Form 20-0996; May 2024 VA Form 10182; June 2024 Brief.  The AOJ has already conceded that the Veteran has a current disability for VA purposes and that he experienced in-service noise exposure (see May 2024 Rating Decision); the Board finds no reason to disturb those favorable findings.

Service treatment records did not document pertinent abnormalities upon entrance to service; however, they documented a permanent positive threshold shift greater than normal measurement variability during service.  See Service Treatment Records; December 2023 VA audiological examination.  The Veteran was first afforded a VA audiological examination in October 1999, during which he described his in-service noise exposure, reported having a gradual decrease in his hearing over the past 14 years, and reported having no hazardous noise exposure post-separation; however, at that time, audiological testing found no hearing loss for VA purposes.  The Veteran was afforded another VA audiological examination in December 2023, during which the examiner acknowledged the Veteran's noise exposure during service and diagnosed bilateral SNHL; however, the examiner opined that the positive threshold shifting during service was more consistent with normal degradation from aging than with noise-induced hearing loss because the audiological data did not document hearing loss for VA purposes during service or upon separation from service.  The December 2023 VA examiner also provided a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) opinion stating that there was no medical or scientific evidence available indicating a relationship between the development of SNHL and the TERA.     

Based on the above, the probative evidence of record persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's bilateral SNHL was at least as likely as not caused by exposure to in-service hazardous noise.  Specifically, the Veteran has competently, credibly, and consistently described how he has experienced continuous, lay-observable decreased hearing since its in-service onset; as such, the Board finds his reports to be probative.  Contrarily, the December 2023 VA examiner's opinion regarding direct service connection is inadequate because the rationale was based on the Veteran not having hearing loss for VA purposes at the time of separation, which does not adequately consider the Veteran's probative reports of lay-observable manifestations since service; as such, the Board finds that opinion to lack probative value.  Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (an examination must consider lay evidence of in-service incurrence or continuity of symptomatology since service); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (VA has a duty to provide a thorough medical examination, one which accounts for the Veteran's prior medical history and describes the disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability is fully informed); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (a VA examination must contain clear conclusions with supporting data and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two).  Despite the inadequate VA opinion, the Board finds that remand for further medical development is not warranted because, as discussed above, there is no indication that the Veteran's audiological problems clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service, in-service noise exposure and positive threshold shifting during service has been conceded, the Veteran is competent to self-diagnose decreased hearing ability and its onset because it is lay-observable through his senses, and the Veteran provided probative reports of lay-observable manifestations since service that were subsequently attributed to the bilateral SNHL diagnosis (even though the measured puretone thresholds did not rise to hearing loss for VA purposes, as legally defined, until after separation).  Jandreau, supra; Layno, supra.  Accordingly, the Veteran's probative statements regarding continuity of symptomatology since service, coupled with post-separation providers attributing that continuing symptomatology to the bilateral SNHL diagnosis, are sufficient to establish a nexus between the in-service injury and the audiological disability.  Thus, the Board grants the claim on a direct basis, resolving it in full.

2. Entitlement to an initial increased rating above 10 percent for tinnitus, to include on an extraschedular basis, during the review period (from May 30, 2023, through May 2, 2024)

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board applies the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity; if the disability more?closely approximates?the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating is assigned.  38?U.S.C. §?1155;?38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.7.  Throughout the review period, the Veteran has been in receipt of the maximum schedular disability rating (10 percent) under DC 6260 (for recurrent tinnitus) for his tinnitus.  See May 2024 Codesheet; 38?C.F.R. §?4.87, DC 6260.  Crucially, DC 6260 limits a Veteran to a single, 10 percent (maximum schedular) rating for?tinnitus, regardless of whether the?tinnitus?is unilateral or bilateral.  38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260, Note (2); Smith v. Nicholson,?451 F.3d 1344?(Fed. Cir. 2006).  Nevertheless, the Veteran generally contends that a higher rating, on an extraschedular basis, is warranted.  See June 2024 Brief (notably, although the June 2024 Brief generally raised the contention of entitlement to an extraschedular rating, neither the Veteran nor his representative have presented specific arguments as to why they believe the Veteran's tinnitus manifestations during the review period warrant extraschedular consideration).

In contrast to the schedular criteria, an extraschedular rating is warranted when a case presents such an exceptional or unusual disability picture, with such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, that would render impractical the application of the regular schedular standards.  38?C.F.R. §?3.321(b)(1); Fanning v. Brown,?4?Vet. App.?225, 229?(1993); Thun v. Peake,?22?Vet. App.?111, 115?(2008).  Specifically, consideration of an extraschedular rating requires a three-step inquiry.  The first question is whether the schedular rating criteria adequately contemplate the Veteran's disability picture.  If not, then the second inquiry is whether the exceptional disability picture exhibits other related factors, such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization.  Thun, supra.  In other words, the first step compares a claimant's manifestations to the rating criteria while the second step addresses the resulting effects of those manifestations; thus, the first and second steps, although interrelated, involve separate and distinct analyses.  Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 495 (2016).  Finally, if the Veteran's disability picture meets the second inquiry, then the third step is to refer the case to the Director of Compensation Service to determine whether an extraschedular rating is warranted.  Thun, supra.

Turning to the evidence of record during the review period, the December 2023 VA audiological examiner documented the Veteran's report that his tinnitus was constant, disturbed his sleep, interfered with his hearing, could be distracting, and sometimes caused headaches.  Comparing the Veteran's reported manifestations to DC 6260, the Board finds that the Veteran's other reported manifestations (beyond recurrent tinnitus) are not specifically contemplated; however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has made clear that a diagnostic code need not list every word or type of symptom to contemplate a type of functional effect (for instance, problems with hearing sounds in crowds, televisions, or telephones are not listed in the diagnostic code for hearing loss but are nonetheless contemplated because they are the actual effects of the hearing loss in daily life).  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).  By extension, the holding in Doucette demonstrates that the Veteran's manifestations and their functional effects are adequately contemplated by the schedular criteria.  Doucette, supra.  Thus, the threshold step under Thun is not met and further consideration of an extraschedular rating is not warranted; however, even if there were tinnitus manifestations outside the contemplation of the schedular criteria, the evidence associated with the claims file during the evidentiary window does not indicate that the Veteran's tinnitus manifested in related factors, such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, during the review period.  Thun, supra.  Thus, referral for extraschedular consideration is not warranted and the Board must deny the claim.
