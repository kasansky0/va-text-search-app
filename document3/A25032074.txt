REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbar spine disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran honorably served in the United States Army from October 1995 to August 1999.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In his August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim currently on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbar spine disability is remanded.

The Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 10 percent for his lumbar spine disability and contends that it is more severe than currently rated. See June 2023 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim. However, remand is necessary in this case to ensure that due process is followed and that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claim so that he is afforded every possible consideration. 38?U.S.C. §?5103; 38?C.F.R. §?3.159. Here, the basis for remand concerns pre-decisional errors arising from VA's duty to assist. 38?C.F.R. §?20.802.

During the Veteran's April 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported recently receiving physical therapy for his lumbar spine disability. See April 2022 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). The Veteran's physical therapy records are relevant to his increased rating claim as they may show that his lumbar spine disability is more severe than currently rated. The records were not obtained and associated with his claims file prior to the September 2023 rating decision on appeal. This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In a June 2023 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran stated that he received chiropractic treatment for his lumbar spine disability. The Veteran reiterated that he had received chiropractic treatment for his lumbar spine disability during a June 2023 VA examination. See June 2023 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) DBQ. The Veteran's chiropractic treatment records are relevant to his increased claim as they may show that his lumbar spine disability is more severe than currently rated. The records were not obtained and associated with his claims file prior to the September 2023 rating decision on appeal. This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Lastly, the Veteran has reported that he takes medication to treat his lumbar spine disability. See April 2022 and June 2023 June 2023 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) DBQs; see also June 2023 VA Form 21-4138. In Jones v. Shinseki, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria." 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). More specifically, "if [a DC] does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication, the Board is required... to discount the ameliorative effects of medication." McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (en banc) (citing Jones, 26 Vet. App. at 63). 

The Court has recently stated that when the Board adjudicates an increased rating claim for a musculoskeletal disability under a diagnostic code which does not contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication, it must consider the beneficial effects of the medication on the severity of the Veterans disability, including an evaluation of the baseline of the veteran's disability and whether it may be more severe than rated without medication. Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, at *18, 19. The Veteran's April 2022 and June 2023 VA examinations were prior to the Court's March 2025 decision in Ingram.

The Board cannot make, on its own, a medical determination as to the ameliorative effects that the Veteran's medications may have on his lumbar spine disability. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991) (stating that the Board cannot make its own, independent medical judgments). Accordingly, the findings of the April 2022 and June 2023 VA examiners require clarification. Affording the Veteran a VA medical opinion which expounds upon the findings of the April 2022 and June 2023 VA examiners has a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim, particularly as to the severity of his lumbar spine disability without the ameliorative effects of medication. The Board therefore finds that the evidence of record was inadequate at the time of the September 2023 rating decision, requiring remand. See 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the Veteran's outstanding lumbar spine physical therapy treatment records, including any scanned images which may be stored in VA's VistaA imaging system. If the Veteran's outstanding lumbar spine physical therapy treatment records cannot be obtained, the AOJ should notify the Veteran and should make a formal finding in a VA memorandum discussing the reason(s) why this directive cannot be achieved.

2. Obtain the Veteran's outstanding lumbar spine chiropractic treatment records including any scanned images which may be stored in VA's VistA imaging system. If the Veteran's outstanding lumbar spine chiropractic treatment records cannot be obtained, the AOJ should notify the Veteran and should make a formal finding in a VA memorandum discussing the reason(s) why this directive cannot be achieved.

3. After completing the first two directives, forward the Veteran's claims file for an addendum opinion regarding the Veteran's lumbar spine disability. The need for a physical examination is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the addendum opinion. The entire claims file must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the VA examiner. All appropriate tests, studies, and consultations should be accomplished, and all clinical findings should be reported in detail.

The medical professional should provide an opinion to the following:

(a.) Consider and discuss if the Veteran's lumbar spine disability would be more severe if it is untreated by medication. Please explain why or why not. 

(b.) Consider and discuss what the baseline of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability would be when the beneficial effects of medication are discounted, i.e., what is the severity of his disability without medication?

(c.) Consider and discuss if, without the beneficial effects of medication whether the Veteran would experience the functional equivalent of ankylosis i.e., functional loss consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis.

The examiner should provide range of motion estimations for flexion, extension, right and left lateral, and right and left rotation movements based on a review of all procurable information - to include the Veteran's statement on examination, case-specific evidence (to include medical treatment records when applicable and lay evidence), and the examiner's medical expertise. 

Additionally, the examiner should address the Veteran's lay statements that he takes medication to treat his lumbar spine disability, and any physical therapy or chiropractic treatment records obtained as a result of this remand. See April 2022 and June 2023 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) DBQs; June 2023 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim.

The examiner is reminded that a medical opinion is adequate if it is based upon consideration of the Veteran's prior medical history and describes the Veteran's condition in sufficient detail so as to allow the Board to make a fully informed evaluation. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?120, 124 (2007); see also Ardison v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?405, 407 (1994). This requires the opinion to "contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two." Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 301 (2008).

If the examiner is unable to offer the requested opinion, it is essential that the examiner offer a rationale for the conclusion that an opinion cannot be provided without resort to speculation, together with a statement as to whether there is additional evidence that might enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge. See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 390 (2010).
