ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinea pedis is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for onychomycosis is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's tinea pedis clearly and unmistakably pre-existed service, but there is evidence to show it was aggravated by service and that the aggravation in service is related to his current tinea pedis.

2. The Veterans onychomycosis is at least as likely as not related to his active-duty service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for tinea pedis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for onychomycosis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1994 to August 1998 and March 1999 to March 2003.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. The AMA modernized review system applies to all claims for which VA issues a notice of an initial decision on or after the February 19, 2019 effective date of the modernized review system.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 higher-level review decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran's claim was initial denied in a May 2023 rating decision, which the Veteran timely appealed by filing an October 2023 VA form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review. The Veteran's claim was then denied in the February 2024 higher-level review decision.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the direct review option. For the Direct Lane docket, the Board's review is limited to the evidentiary record at the time of the RO decision on appeal. See Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 151, (2021). 

Service Connection

Every veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service. 38 U.S.C. § 1111. Noted at entry, a defect, infirmity, or disorder will be considered to have been aggravated by active service if there is an increase in disability during such service, unless clear and unmistakable evidence shows that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306. 

If a preexisting disorder is noted upon entry into service, the veteran cannot bring a claim for service connection for that disorder, but the veteran may bring a claim for service-connected aggravation of that disorder. In that case section 1153 applies and the burden falls on the veteran to establish aggravation by demonstrating an increase in the severity of the condition during service. See Jensen v. Brown, 19 F.3d 1413, 1417 (Fed.Cir.1994). If the Veteran meets this burden, then the presumption of aggravation under section 1153 arises, and the burden shifts to the government to show a lack of aggravation by establishing through clear and unmistakable evidence "that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease." 38 U.S.C. § 1153; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.306; Jensen, 19 F.3d at 1417. See also Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 236-37 (2012). 

Clear and unmistakable evidence is a more formidable evidentiary burden than the preponderance of the evidence standard.  See Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999) (noting that "clear and convincing" burden of proof, while a higher standard than a preponderance of the evidence, is a lower burden to satisfy than clear and unmistakable evidence).  It is an "onerous" evidentiary standard, requiring that the no-aggravation result be "undebatable."  Cotant v. West, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003) (citing Laposky v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 331, 334 (1993) (citing Akins v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 228, 232 (1991)) and Vanerson, 12 Vet. App. at 258, 261; id. at 263 (Nebeker, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Even if the presumption of aggravation is met, a nexus must still be established between that aggravation in service and the current disability. Gilbert (Daniel R.) v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012) (per curiam) (the presumption of soundness relates to the "in-service incurrence or aggravation" element necessary to establish service connection as distinct from the "nexus" element and the legal standard for rebutting the presumption of soundness (clear and unmistakable evidence standard) and the standard for establishing a nexus between an in-service injury and a current disability (preponderance of the evidence standard) are different.).

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). The absence of any one element will result in the denial of service connection.

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinea pedis is granted.

The Veteran contends that his tinea pedis is related to his active-duty service. However, the Board notes that the question of whether the Veteran's tinea pedis preexisted service has been raised by the record. Specifically, the Veteran's entrance examination from February 1999, indicates the Veteran had tinea pedis, documented as athletes foot, upon entrance to his second period of active-duty service. Thus, record indicates the Veteran's tinea pedis pre-existed service and the first question is whether it was aggravated during service.

The Board must next consider if the Veteran's tinea pedis increased in severity during service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.306; Jensen, 19 F.3d at 141. During the April 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that the use of communal showers during active-duty service caused skin problems with his feet, toes, heels, and toenails causing itching. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's tinea pedis increased in severity during service.

The next question is whether the Veteran's tinea pedis was aggravated beyond its natural progression by his service. The burden now shifts to the government to show a lack of aggravation by establishing through clear and unmistakable evidence "that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease." In the present case, the April 2023 examiner found that the Veteran's tinea pedis was aggravated by the communal showers in service. Thus, aggravation beyond the normal progression has been established. 

Finally, with regard to a nexus between the Veteran's aggravated tinea pedis in service and his current diagnosis, the VA examiner provided a positive nexus opinion, indicating the Veteran's tinea pedis had persisted since service as a chronic condition. 

Accordingly, the Board finds the elements of service connection have been met, and service connection for tinea pedis is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for onychomycosis is granted.

The Veteran contends that his onychomycosis is related to his active-duty service. The Board finds the elements of service connection have been met.

With respect to current disability, in the February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of onychomycosis. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).

With respect to in-service incurrence, During the April 2023 VA examination the Veteran reported noticing issues with his toenails, such as thickening of the toenails with discoloration. during his active-duty service following the use of communal showers. The Veteran indicated he suffered from itching and attempted to treat his issues with over-the-counter medication without success. The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and observable events within the realm of his personal knowledge.  Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 470-471 (1994); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. Furthermore, the Board finds no reason to doubt the credibility of these statements, as they have been consistent throughout his appeal.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements sufficiently establish the in-service incurrence element of this claim.

The remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current disability and in-service incurrence. The record contains a positive nexus opinion.

As noted above, the Veteran first noticed issues with his toenails during active-duty service. In the April 2023 VA examination, the examiner indicated that fungal infections of the nail are not curable and typically require long term symptom management or treatment to suppress recurrence of symptoms. The examiner opined the Veteran's onychomycosis was at least as likely as not related to the Veteran's active-duty service.

Accordingly, the Board finds the elements of service connection have been met and service connection for onychomycosis is granted.
