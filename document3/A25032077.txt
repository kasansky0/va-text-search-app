ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep apnea was denied in a February 2016 rating decision.  He was notified of this decision and timely disagreed with it, but did not perfect a substantive appeal within one year of the rating decision or 60 days of the Statement of the Case (SOC) that was mailed in June 2017, and it became final.  Any new and material evidence submitted within one year of the February 2016 rating decision was considered in the June 2017 SOC.

2. The Veteran's request to reopen his claim for service connection for sleep apnea was denied in a February 2018 rating decision.  He was notified of this decision, did not timely disagree with it, and new and material evidence was not obtained within one year of it, and it became final.

3. VA received notice of the Veteran's intent to file a claim on September 6, 2022 and received his request to reopen his claim for service connection for sleep apnea on September 16, 2022.  The April 2023 rating decision resulting from that claim granted service connection for sleep apnea, with an effective date of August 10, 2022, based on the effective date of a liberalizing law.  There is no indication of an attempt to reopen the claim between February 2018 and August 10, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for sleep apnea are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5108, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.400, 19.52, 20.1103.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from March 1983 to February 2013, including service in the Persian Gulf War, Iraq, and Afghanistan, for which his decorations included the Legion of Merit and the Combat Action Badge.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the effective date assigned in the April 2023 rating decision.  In April 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2023 decision.  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that, in his Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran expressed intent to appeal both the effective date and disability rating for his sleep apnea.  Because the HLR decision on appeal only addressed the effective date, the disability rating is beyond the scope of this appeal.  

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any issue with the duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issue being decided on the merits below that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.???See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board.");?Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying?Scott?to a duty to assist argument).? 

1. Sleep Apnea

The Veteran contends that he should be granted an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for service connection for sleep apnea.  He has not requested any specific effective date.

Unless specifically provided otherwise by statute, the effective date of an award for compensation benefits based on (1) an original claim, (2) a claim reopened after final adjudication, or (3) a claim for increase, is the date VA received the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999) (holding that the effective date of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but rather, on the date the application was filed with VA).  

An exception applies when service connection is granted pursuant to a liberalizing law or a liberalizing VA issue.  In such cases, when the claim is received within one year of the effective date of the law or VA issue, benefits may be authorized from the effective date of the law or VA issue, but the effective date of the award of service connection shall not be earlier than the effective date of the act or administrative issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

In general, rating decisions that are not timely appealed are final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.  In the legacy appeal system, to be timely, a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) must be filed within one year of the date VA mails notice of a rating decision to the Veteran; a substantive appeal must be filed within 60 days from the date VA mails notice of a Statement of the Case (SOC) to the Veteran or within one year of the mailing of the rating decision, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 19.52.  

VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection for issues including a sleep disorder and sleep disturbances on April 5, 2013.  In a May 2014 rating decision, VA considered this to be part of his claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability and granted that claim.  

VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep apnea on September 30, 2015.  VA denied the Veteran's claim in a February 2016 rating decision.  The basis for the denial was that there was no evidence of a nexus to service.  It is unnecessary for the Board to determine whether the April 2013 claim included a claim for service connection for sleep apnea because, to the extent that there was such an outstanding claim, it was addressed in the February 2016 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted an NOD later in February 2016 but did not perfect an appeal within one year of the rating decision or within 60 days of the June 2017 SOC.

In March 2016, the Veteran submitted copies of service treatment and service personnel records.  "Notwithstanding any other section in this part, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA received or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim."? 38?C.F.R. §?3.156?(c)(1).  "Relevant" means the evidence "must tend to prove or disprove a material fact." AZ v. Shinseki, 731 F.3d 1303, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Because these records were considered in the June 2017 SOC, it is unnecessary for the Board to determine whether these records were relevant and had not previously been associated with the claims file. 

In addition, "VA has a long history of considering documents that were not literally before an examiner to be constructively part of a claimant's record." Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  Evidence is constructively received if it is generated by VA and "relevant and reasonably connected" to the Veteran's claim.  See id. at 1354.  The most common example of VA-generated documents are VA treatment records.  Here, any VA treatment records generated within one year of the February 2016 rating decision were considered in the June 2017 SOC.  

Therefore, the February 2016 rating decision is final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 19.52, 20.1103.  

VA received notice of the Veteran's intent to file a claim on December 18, 2017 and received his request to reopen his claim for service connection for sleep apnea on January 4, 2018.  VA denied the request in a February 2018 rating decision on the basis that the evidence submitted was not new and material.  The Veteran did not submit an NOD or new and material evidence within one year of this decision.

VA treatment records generated within one year of the February 2018 rating decision include a January 2019 treatment record noting that the Veteran's treatment for sleep apnea.  Although this evidence is relevant to the claim, because it does not pertain to the issue of a nexus to service, it is not material.  

Therefore, the February 2018 rating decision is final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 19.52, 20.1103.

VA received notice of the Veteran's intent to file a claim on September 6, 2022 and received his request to reopen his claim for service connection for sleep apnea on September 16, 2022.  This claim led to the April 2023 rating decision granting service connection for sleep apnea and assigning an effective date of August 10, 2022.  This is the effective date of the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (PACT Act), which was a liberalizing law within one year prior to the September 6, 2022 notice of intent to file.  

The Board has reviewed the claims file for any document, submitted after the February 2018 rating decision but before the August 10, 2022 effective date of the PACT Act, that could be considered a claim for service connection for sleep apnea and has found none.  Moreover, neither the Veteran nor his representative assert that the Veteran filed an informal or formal claim during that time.  

When a Veteran has a claim to reopen or readjudicate, "he cannot obtain an effective date earlier than the reopened claim's application date."  Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (indicating that "no matter how [the Veteran] tries to define 'effective date,' the simple fact is that, absent a showing of CUE, he cannot receive disability payments for a time frame earlier than the application date of his claim to reopen, even with new evidence supporting an earlier disability date").

In order for the Veteran to be awarded an effective date based on the claims that were denied in the prior rating decisions, he has to show clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the prior denial as a collateral attack.  Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995).  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised CUE to overcome the finality of the prior rating decisions denying service connection.  Any claim of CUE must be pled with specificity.  See Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  This specific allegation must assert more than merely disagreement with how the facts of the case were weighed or evaluated.  Persuasive reasons must be given as to why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error.  

For those reasons, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for service connection for sleep apnea, which is the effective date of the liberalizing law within one year prior to the claim that led to the grant of service connection.
