ORDER

The appeal for recognition of N.C. as the Veteran's dependent spouse for purposes of dependency benefits is moot and is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Regional Office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs recognized N.C. as the Veteran's dependent spouse for purposes of dependency benefits for the entire appeal period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for recognition of N.C. as the Veteran's dependent spouse for purposes of dependency benefits are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from May 1970 until his honorable discharge in April 1974.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board of Veterans' Appeals' (Board) docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c) and is being adjudicated according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

This case comes before the Board on appeal from a June 9, 2022, decision issued by a Regional Office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The Board received VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on June 16, 2022, from the Veteran. He elected the Evidence Review docket. A June 28, 2022, Board letter informed the Veteran and his representative that his appeal had been formally placed on the Board's Evidence Review docket. The Board's Evidence Review docket provides the Veteran the opportunity to submit additional evidence within 90 days of the Board's receipt of the Notice of Disagreement. The requisite 90-day period has expired, and the Board may proceed to adjudicate the claim.

Evidentiary Standards

Because the Veteran has selected to have the Board review his appeal under "Evidence Review," the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the June 9, 2022, decision and the evidence submitted within 90 days of the Veteran's filing of his Notice of Disagreement with respect to that decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. Evidence received outside of those timeframes may not be considered by the Board when adjudicating the merits of the appeal. 

Any findings favorable to the Veteran made by the VA Regional Office in notification of a decision are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). "Findings" means "conclusions on questions of fact and application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue under review." Id.

Dependency Benefits - Spouse

Any veteran who is entitled to disability compensation, and whose disability is rated not less than 30 percent, is entitled to additional compensation for dependents, including for a spouse. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(2). The appellate courts have explained that entitlement to dependency compensation does not require submission of a separate claim; rather, a claimant need only submit updated information about his dependent to receive more compensation. Sharp v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 267, 272 (2009).  

Statute and VA regulations specify what constitutes necessary "evidence" in this context. See 38 U.S.C. § 5124; 38 C.F.R. § 3.204.  As it pertains to this Veteran's appeal, the relevant provision states that "VA will accept, for the purpose of determining entitlement to benefits under laws administered by VA, the statement of a claimant as proof of marriage provided that the statement contains: the date (month and year) and place of the event; [and] the full name and relationship of the other person to the claimant." 38 C.F.R. § 3.204(a)(1). "In addition, a claimant must provide the social security number of any dependent on whose behalf he or she is seeking benefits." Id. (citing 38 C.F.R. § 3.216). 

Regardless of the regulation governing effective dates of awards, payment of monetary benefits based on compensation begins the first day of the month following the effective date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

Analysis

From June 17, 2020, the Veteran has had a combined disability rating of 30 percent for his service-connected disabilities. Thus, as of June 17, 2020, he met the numerical criteria for eligibility to receive dependency compensation.

Following an April 28, 2022, Rating Decision, which established his 30 percent combined disability rating, he submitted VA Form 21-686c (Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents). He identified that he was seeking to add his spouse, N.C., as a dependent. The VA Regional Office denied the request because the Veteran had misidentified his date of divorce from his previous wife, which meant that VA could not acknowledge N.C. as his current wife. 

Following his appeal, the VA Regional Office recognized N.C. as the Veteran's dependent spouse for dependency compensation in a March 4, 2024, decision notification letter. It assigned an effective date of payment as July 1, 2020, for the award of dependency compensation. The effective date covers the entire period currently on appeal. July 1, 2020, is also the earliest legally possible effective date for payment under 38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

The Board has an obligation to ensure that a case or controversy exists. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105. A case or controversy ceases to exist, and a case becomes moot, "when the issues presented are no longer 'live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome." Godsey v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 207, 218 (2019). When the relief sought by an appeal has been accomplished, the appropriate course of action is for the Board to dismiss the matter as moot. See Long v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 555, 557 (2004).

Here, the Veteran is in receipt of dependency compensation for his spouse, N.C., as of the earliest legally possible effective date. There are no additional benefits that the Board can grant. Thus, this appeal is moot and is dismissed.
