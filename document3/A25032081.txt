ORDER

The request to readjudicate the previous denial of service connection for Bell's palsy (claimed as facial nerve damage) is granted.

Service connection for erectile dysfunction is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for Bell's palsy (claimed as facial nerve damage) to include as secondary to service-connected scar, residual of removal of sebaceous cyst of the left eyebrow is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. New and relevant evidence was received after the May 2023 rating decision that denied service connection for Bell's palsy.

2. The evidence does not show that the Veteran's current erectile dysfunction began during active service, is caused by an injury, event, or disease during active service, or is caused by or aggravated by a service-connected disability. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria to readjudicate the previously denied service connection claim for Bell's palsy are met.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).

2. The criteria for service connection for erectile dysfunction to include as due to a service-connected disability is not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Connecticut Army National Guard from August 1979 to February 1981 and in the Army Reserves from February 1981 to December 1991.  The Veteran's service records show that the Veteran had Federalized active duty for training (ACDUTRA) from September 2, 1979 to December 18, 1979 and Federalized active duty from September 15, 1985 to October 23, 1985.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions dated December 29, 2023 and February 6, 2024 issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction.  In the December 29, 2023 rating decision, the RO continued the denial of service connection for Bell's palsy because there was no new and material evidence.  In the February 6, 2024 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for erectile dysfunction. 

On April 19, 2024, the RO received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  The Veteran elected the Board Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on December 6, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, December 29, 2023 for the service connection claim for Bell's palsy and February 6, 2024 for the service connection claim for erectile dysfunction, and any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his attorney at the hearing and within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Regarding the Veteran's service connection claim for erectile dysfunction, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for Bell's palsy, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Whether new and relevance evidence was received to warrant readjudication of the previous denied service connection claim for Bell's palsy (claimed as facial nerve damage).

The Veteran contends that his Bell's palsy is caused by the sebaceous cyst and nerve damage that occurred during active service and/or is secondary to his service-connected scar, residual of removal of sebaceous cyst of the left eyebrow.

The Veteran originally filed a service connection claim for Bell's palsy in May 2023.  In a May 2023 rating decision, the RO denied the claim.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim in July 2023.  VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).  "New evidence" is evidence that was not part of the record at the time of the prior denial.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1). "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim and includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

The questions in this case are whether the Veteran submitted evidence or evidence was procured after the prior denial of his service connection claim for Bell's palsy, and if so, whether the evidence is new and relevant to his claim.

The evidence received since the May 2023 rating decision and during the relevant evidentiary period includes a VA examination and medical opinion in September 2023 and lay statements from the Veteran during the December 6, 2024 Board hearing.

The RO received new evidence after the May 2023 rating decision that is relevant to his claim.  Specifically, the RO obtained a new VA examination and medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's Bell's palsy was related to a period of active service.  This evidence was not already of record and tends to prove or disprove the nexus element of the service connection claim for Bell's palsy.  Thus, readjudication of the service connection claim for Bell's palsy is warranted.

The service connection claim for Bell's palsy is addressed in the Remand section below.

2. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction.

The Veteran contends that his erectile dysfunction is caused by his active service.  Specifically, he asserts that he believes he had the problem in service, but he was not diagnosed until later.  See Board Hearing Transcript at 12.  Specifically, he noticed a reduction in his sexual drive during service.  Id. at 13.  He also contends that his erectile dysfunction was caused by or aggravated by medication to treat his service-connected and nonservice-connected disabilities.  Id. At 12-13. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated in line of duty in the active military, naval, air, or space service ("active service").  See 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  "Active service" includes active duty, any period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) during which the individual was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty, or any period of inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA) during which the individual was disabled or died from an injury (or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident) incurred in or aggravated in line of duty.  38 U.S.C. § 101(24).

In pertinent part, to have basic eligibility for VA disability benefits, as a veteran based on a period of duty as a member of a state Army National Guard, a National Guardsman must have been ordered into Federal service by the President of the United States pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 12401 ("Title10" service), or his duty must have been performed under the provisions of 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 ("Title 32" service).  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(21), (22)(C), (23)).

The Veteran's service personnel records show he served on ACDUTRA in the Army from September 2, 1979 to December 18, 1979 and on active duty from September 15, 1985 to October 23, 1985 under Title 10.  Otherwise, he served in the Connecticut Army National Guard from August 1979 to February 1981 (exclusive of the Army ACDUTRA period) and in the Army Reserves from February 1981 to December 3, 1991 (exclusive of the Army active-duty period).  As his records show that his Army Reserve service from September 15, 1985 to October 23, 1985 was performed under Title 10, he has basic eligibility for VA disability compensation benefits for such period.  The evidence also shows that the Veteran has a period of ACDUTRA in the Army from September 2, 1979 to December 18, 1979.  In this regard, the records reveal that the Veteran had training at Fort Benning during that time period and his claims file shows that he was awarded service connection for scar, residual of removal of sebaceous cyst of the left eyebrow, effective from July 31, 2000, based on the period of ADT from September 2, 1979 to December 18, 1979.  Thus, he is deemed to have had "active service" for such period and to have satisfied the definition of "veteran" under 38 U.S.C. § 101(2).

To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of: (1) a current disability (for which service connection is sought); (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the claimed disability and the disease or injury in service.  See Shedden v, Principi, 381 F.3d 1153, 1166-1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Where a chronic disease is shown in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease are generally service connected; if a chronic disease is noted in service but chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity of symptomatology after separation is required.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Entitlement to service connection based on chronicity or continuity of symptomatology pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) applies only to a disease enumerated on the list of chronic diseases in 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101(3) or 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Erectile dysfunction is not listed as a chronic disease.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101(3), 1112(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a), 3.309(a).  

Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Generally, a claimant whose claim is based on a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA cannot be entitled to a presumption of service connection.  See Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 47 (2010).  However, after a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA is determined to be "active service," as is the Veteran's case, the presumption of service connection can be applied to that period of service (provided that in cases involving chronic and tropical presumptions, there is a period of at least 90 days of continuous active service, which the Veteran meets for his first period of active service).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during his period of qualifying active service (in this case September 2, 1979 to December 18, 1979 and from September 15, 1985 to October 23, 1985), was approximately at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease during such period of active service, or is proximately due to, the result of, or is aggravated beyond its natural progress by service-connected disability.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that his erectile dysfunction began during active service, is caused by an injury, event, or disease during active service from September 2, 1979 to December 18, 1979 and from September 15, 1985 to October 23, 1985, or that his erectile dysfunction is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by service-connected disability.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).

A February 2024 rating decision provides a favorable finding that VA treatment records show a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.  In the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by this favorable finding.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Thus, the evidence shows that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.

The Veteran's service treatment records from September 2, 1979 to December 18, 1979 during ACDUTRA and from September 15, 1985 to October 23, 1985 during active duty do not reflect complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.  Thus, the medical evidence does not support that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction began during a period of active service.

Post-service treatment records do not document any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of erectile dysfunction until September 2013, approximately 28 years after his most recent period of active service.  Specifically, a September 2013 VA treatment record documents that the Veteran reported symptoms of erectile dysfunction.  He stated that he would like to try Viagra.  The physician assistant diagnosed the Veteran with erectile dysfunction and the plan was to treat with Viagra 100 mg tabs.  

During the December 2024 Board hearing the Veteran testified that "[he] wants to think that it might've been -I want to think it was in service because I noticed a change, you know, when you are training and so forth and on.  And I noticed the change in my sexual activity" in response to the question of was he in service when he first started experiencing issues with erectile dysfunction.  He also stated that as time went on being on all types of medication, it didn't help him.  The Veteran testified that he took Viagra constantly all the time for years, over 25 or 30 years.  He also thought the nerve damage in his face led to a lot of other things including his erectile dysfunction.  While the Veteran is competent to report experiencing symptoms of erectile dysfunction during service, it is unclear based on his December 2024 testimony whether the onset of his symptoms of erectile dysfunction began during a period of active service.  The Board also finds that his statements as to the onset of erectile dysfunction, as well as, when he was prescribed medication to treat his erectile dysfunction are not credible.  Specifically, his testimony conflicts with the post service treatment records.  In this regard, a September 2013 VA treatment record indicates that this was the first time the Veteran sought treatment for erective dysfunction and he was prescribed Viagra.  Prior to September 2013, the Veteran's VA treatment records did not list erectile dysfunction in the problem list or list Viagra or other medication used to treat erectile dysfunction in the medication list.  Finally, even if there is credible evidence of erectile dysfunction during a period of active service, the Veteran did not assert that he experienced continuous symptoms since service.  

With respect to whether the Veteran's current erectile dysfunction is caused by an injury, event, or disease during active service, the AOJ did not provide the Veteran with a VA examination and/or medical opinion.  In this case, there was no medical or lay evidence of symptoms or a medical diagnosis of erectile dysfunction during active service and there was no adequate evidence indicating that there may be any relationship between his current erectile dysfunction and his active service at the time of the February 2024 rating decision on appeal.  Thus, the low threshold under McLendon was not met and VA's duty to provide a VA examination or medical opinion had not been triggered at the time of the February 2024 rating decision on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 3.326; McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

In February 2025, the Veteran's attorney submitted a February 2025 private medical opinion from a private physician.  The physician provided the opinion that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is as likely as not service-connected.  The physician's rationale was that the Veteran reported that the most stressful aspect of his military service was the fact that there was a failure of the military/VA to provide treatment for injuries sustained during service, including eye difficulty and joint pain.  A February 2016 nursing outpatient note indicates that the Veteran has anxiety.  The physician explained that this level of anxiety as likely as not is a significant cause of erectile dysfunction.  This medical opinion is of low probative value as to whether the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is caused by an injury, event, or disease during active service, because the Veteran's service records do not show that the Veteran had symptoms of anxiety or had an anxiety disorder during active service, the example the physician provided of the Veteran's anxiety was from a February 2016 treatment record, and the Veteran does not currently have a service-connected mental health disorder to include anxiety. 

The Veteran raised the issue of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction as secondary to his service-connected disability and medication used to treat his service-connected disability.  While the Veteran believes that his erectile dysfunction was caused by, proximately due to, or aggravated by his service-connected scar, residual of sebaceous cyst removal of the left ear to include any medication to treat such disability, the Veteran is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires medical knowledge of anatomical relationships, neurogenic or neurological interactions with erectile dysfunction, and complications of medication.  Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that the Veteran has the skills or medical training to make such a determination.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).  The Board also finds it persuasive that there is no competent medical evidence of record in support of this claim.

The AOJ did not provide the Veteran with a VA examination and/or medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is secondary to his service-connected disability to include any medication used to treat such disability.  However, the Veteran only raised this theory of entitlement during the December 2024 Board hearing.  There was no lay or medical evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 rating decision on appeal indicating that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction may be secondary to a service-connected disability.  Similarly, the record shows that a service connection claim for erectile dysfunction on a secondary or aggravation basis was not reasonably raised by the record prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal.  Thus, the AOJ did not commit a pre-decisional duty to assist error in not obtaining a VA examination and medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is secondary to a service-connected disability.  Accordingly, a remand on that basis is not warranted.

In conclusion, the credible, competent, and probative evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's current diagnosis of erectile dysfunction began during a period of active service, is caused by an injury, event, or disease during a period of active service, or is caused by or aggravated by his service-connected scar, residual of sebaceous cyst removal of the left ear.  Accordingly, service connection for erectile dysfunction is not warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for Bell's palsy (claimed as facial nerve damage) to include as secondary to service-connected scar, residual of removal of sebaceous cyst of the left eyebrow.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for Bell's palsy is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the December 29, 2023 rating decision on appeal.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) obtained a medical opinion in May 2023 prior to the December 29, 2023 rating decision on appeal.  However, this medical opinion does not provide an opinion regarding whether the Veteran's Bell's palsy is aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected scar, residual of removal of sebaceous cyst of the left eyebrow.  These contentions were known prior to the December 29, 2023 rating decision on appeal.  Thus, a remand is necessary correct a pre-decision duty to assist error and obtain a medical opinion that addresses whether the Veteran's current Bell's palsy was aggravated by his service-connected scar, residual of removal of sebaceous cyst of the left eyebrow.

Notably, the Veteran's attorney, Alexander Jackson, submitted a private medical opinion during the 90-day evidentiary window following the Board hearing.  The doctor, Robert Phelps, Jr., MD opined that the Veteran's Bell's Palsy is at least as likely as not related to the Veteran's service.  Dr. Phelps' opinion indicates, "A review of the literature regarding Bell's palsy suggests that the etiology of Bell's Palsy remains unknown."  Similarly, Dr. Phelps states, "The literature does not address the issue of the time line between exposure to an etiologic factor causing Bell's and the clinical presentation of Bell's Palsy."  Mr. Phelps concludes, "Given the uncertainties regarding the etiology of Bell's palsy, it is as likely as not that [the Veteran's] Bell's palsy is connected to, related to, and/or caused by, his service."  In short, this opinion is purely speculative.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a VA medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's current Bell's palsy was aggravated (made worse beyond natural progression) by his service-connected scar, residual of removal of sebaceous cyst of the left eyebrow.

Provide an examination if one is deemed necessary by the medical professional.

The contents of the entire, electronic claims file to include a complete copy of this REMAND, must be made available to the medical professional, and the medical opinion report should reflect full consideration of the Veteran's documented medical history and lay assertions to include his testimony at the December 2024 Board hearing.

The medical professional is asked to provide an opinion on whether the Veteran's current Bell's palsy is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected scar, residual of removal of sebaceous cyst of the left eyebrow.

If aggravation is found, the medical professional should attempt to quantify the degree of additional disability resulting from the aggravation.

A complete, clearly stated rationale for the conclusions reached-to include identification of evidence and medical authority relied upon-should be provided.
