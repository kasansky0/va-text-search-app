DOCKET NO. 240503-438028
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable (greater than 0 percent) rating for hypertension is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period, while the Veteran took continuous medication for control of his hypertension, he did not have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. Additionally, he did not have systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a compensable (greater than 0 percent) rating for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.31, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1986 through November 2006 in the United States Marine Corps.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. The rating decision on appeal was a higher-level review of an earlier September 2023 rating decision which denied an increased rating for hypertension.?? 

In May 2024 the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement: VA Form 10182 with the April 2024 higher-level review decision. The Veteran selected the direct review docket. Based on that docket selection, and that the rating decision on appeal is a higher-level review decision, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the VA Regional Office issued the September 2023 rating decision. If evidence was submitted during the period after the September 2023 rating decision was issued, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.?? 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim: VA Form 20-0995 and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.?? 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C.? § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.??? 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Entitlement to a compensable (greater than 0 percent) rating for hypertension is denied.

Legal Criteria

The Veteran's hypertension is rated under diagnostic code (DC) 7101. Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101. A 20 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. Id. A 40 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. Id. A 60 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. Id. 

The word "predominantly" is not defined in the rating schedule. Absent an express definition, it is presumed that VA regulations employ words using their ordinary dictionary meanings. "Predominant" is defined as "being most frequent or common." See "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant. 

Factual Background

The Board notes that the appeal period begins on September 1, 2022, the date VA received the Veteran's increased rating claim, plus the one-year look back period. Gatson v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Throughout the appeal period the Veteran's blood pressure was taken 18 times. Those readings are as follows: 105/73, 105/73, 105/73, 117/73, 109/53, 129/84, 129/84, 132/87, 159/91, 154/91, 132/87, 154/91, 138/93, 127/81, 127/81, 156/91, 156/93, 152/80.

While not all blood pressure readings are discussed specifically, the Board has reviewed all available records and taken them into consideration.

Analysis

Based on the evidence of record, the Board determines that the Veteran's hypertension does not warrant a compensable rating at this time. After review of all available records, the Veteran's diastolic pressure has not, at any point during the appeal period, been 100 or more. During this period, the highest diastolic reading was 93. Additionally, the Veteran's systolic pressure has never been 160 or more. During this period, the highest systolic reading was 159. While the Board is cognizant that some of the readings in the medical record are bordering on the threshold, they do not cross the threshold.

The Board notes that the evidence indicates that the Veteran does use medication to control his blood pressure. However, the rating criteria requires a diastolic pressure which historically exceeds 100 in order to grant a compensable rating based on the use of medication. After a review of the file, the Veteran's blood pressure readings historically have been lower than 100 predominantly. 

Thus, without medical evidence which indicates that the Veteran's blood pressure has predominant diastolic readings of 100 or more, or systolic readings predominantly 160 or more, the Board must deny the claim for an increased rating.
