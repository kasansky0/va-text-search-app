ORDER

Entitlement to a 50 percent rating for tension headaches (claimed as headaches secondary to tinnitus, now diagnosed as migraines) from March 29, 2023, to May 11, 2024, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

For the appeal period prior to May 11, 2024, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's tension headaches (now diagnosed as migraines) more nearly approximated headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for a 50 percent rating for service-connected tension headaches (now diagnosed as migraines) have been met for the appeal period prior to May 11, 2024. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.10, 4.124a, DC 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 2009 until his honorable discharge in October 2012.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to a 50 percent rating for tension headaches (claimed as headaches to tinnitus, now diagnosed as migraines) from March 29, 2023, to May 11, 2024, is granted.

By way of background, in a June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for tension headaches (claimed as headaches to tinnitus) with an evaluation of 0 percent effective March 29, 2023. In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the initial disability rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected headaches. In May 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and increased the evaluation of the Veteran's headaches to 50 percent disabling effective May 11, 2024.

The Veteran contends (through his representative) that he is entitled to a rating of at least 30 percent effective March 29, 2023, through to his increased rating of 50 percent granted effective May 11, 2024. See Third Party Correspondence received June 7, 2024.

Disability ratings are assigned in accordance with VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a disability. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where service connection has been granted and the assignment of an initial rating is disputed, separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. In other words, the ratings may be "staged." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-126 (1999).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). If the evidence persuasively weighs against a claim, the claim is denied.

Under DC 8100, a 10 percent rating is assigned with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months. A 30 percent rating is assigned with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months. A 50 percent rating is assigned for very frequent completely prostrating headaches with prolonged attacks that are productive of severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100.

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018). This renders 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable. Id. 

In Johnson v. Wilkie, the Court defined "prostrating" as "lacking in vitality or will: powerless to rise: laid low." See Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252 (citing Webster's Third New International Dictionary of The English Language Unabridged 1822 (1966)). The Court explained that "[b]ecause DC 8100 specifically governs migraine headaches, the phrase 'characteristic prostrating attacks' plainly describes migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality.'" Id. The Court also explained that the modifier "completely," as used before "prostrating" in the 50% criteria, meant that the veteran must be rendered entirely powerless, that the phrase "very frequent" connoted a frequency greater than once a month, and that "productive of severe economic inadaptability" meant either producing or capable of producing severe economic inadaptability. Id. at 253. See also Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67, 70-71 (2020) ("Putting all this together, we see that the 50% rating for migraines is appropriate with very frequent, prolonged attacks that render the veteran entirely powerless and either cause or can cause severe economic inadaptability.").

Additionally, the Court has held that "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria." See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). As DC 8100 does not contemplate the effects of medication in alleviating the frequency and duration of the Veteran's headaches, the Board is precluded from considering the relief afforded by the Veteran's medication, if any, in evaluating the severity of his disability. Id. 

Upon consideration of the evidence of record, and without considering the ameliorative effects of any medication, the Board finds that the Veteran's headaches more nearly approximated the criteria for a 50 percent disability rating throughout the appeal period prior to May 11, 2024.

In March 2023, the Veteran provided a Statement in Support of Claim. He reported that his headaches occur 3 to 4 times a week and that the headache pain generally occurs on the back of his head, on the front of his head, on his forehead, and behind his ears. He also reported that at least a couple times a month, the headaches knock him out of commission to the point that he is totally incapacitated and unable to do any normal daily activities for two hours, and that during his headaches, he has light sensitivity, visual spots, flashing or shimmering lights, blind spots, nausea, weakness, vertigo, dizziness, throbbing pain, and pulsating pain. In addition, he reported that in the last 12 months he has missed about 3 weeks of work due to his episodes and that he has missed events and activities because his headaches render him unable to function at all. He further reported that he takes over the counter Excedrin Migraine, Excedrin Extra Strength, Aleve, and Tylenol to help treat these symptoms.

In an April 2023 VA examination report, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's headaches were pulsating or throbbing with nausea, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound. The examiner also indicated that the Veteran reported having to take two weeks of sick leave over the course of six months at work and that he also had to change his job because of his headaches. The examiner noted that the Veteran treated his headaches with over the counter Advil and Ibuprofen.

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a lay statement dated March 29, 2024, in which he reported that he has been experiencing multiple headaches and migraines, with some being more severe, multiple times daily. He indicated that over the years his headaches and migraines have become increasingly more frequent and more severe, sometimes lasting more than 6 hours, and that he has tried treating them with over the counter pain relievers, prescribed medications (e.g., Naproxen), steam baths, breathing treatments, and more. In addition, he reported that some of his headaches and migraines have been debilitating to where he is unable to participate in or complete daily tasks/activities and that there have been several days where he has had to leave his job and take sick leave due to headaches and migraines. 

In April 2024, along with his lay statement, the Veteran submitted a headache log dated April 22, 2024, in which he tracked his headaches over the course of many days. See, e.g., VA Form 21-4138 (Headache Log) received April 29, 2024 (indicating, e.g., that on 3/27/24, he "had to leave work early due to headache, laid down for several hours to relieve the pain," and on 3/28/24 he "had to stop work several times to make it through the day").

The Veteran is competent to report his headaches symptomatology, and there is no indication in the evidence of record that he lacks credibility. Thus, his testimony as to his headache symptoms is afforded appropriate probative weight. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Considering all relevant evidence of record, and without considering the ameliorative effects of any medication, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's headaches manifested in very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. In cases where the evidence is in approximate balance, the claimant prevails. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (a claimant is to receive the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate balance" of positive and negative evidence). As such, with reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, a 50 percent rating under DC 8100 is granted for the appeal period prior to May 11, 2024. This is the highest available schedular rating for migraine headaches under DC 8100.

The Board has considered that a veteran's TDIU claim may be inferred based on a fair reading of the evidence of record. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (inferred TDIU claims are part and parcel of an underlying increased rating claim). In this case, there is no inferred claim for TDIU under Rice because the Veteran is gainfully employed. See, e.g., April 2023 C&P Exam (Headaches DBQ); May 2024 C&P Exam (Headaches DBQ).
