ORDER

Entitlement to service connection of thoracolumbar spine degenerative joint disease with degenerative disc disease, claimed as disc degeneration, is granted.

Entitlement to a maximum 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder from August 23, 2023, is granted.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for chronic bronchitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's thoracolumbar spine degenerative joint disease with degenerative disc disease manifested during active service.

2. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms have resulted in total social and occupational impairment.

3. The Veteran's pulmonary function testing reflects a FEV-1/FVC of 77 percent.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection of thoracolumbar spine degenerative joint disease with degenerative disc disease have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

2. From August 23, 2023, the criteria for entitlement to a maximum, 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for chronic bronchitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.96, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6600.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 2004 to December 2005, from August 2006 to September 2007, and from September 2010 to November 2011.

Procedural History

On August 23, 2023, the Veteran filed a claim seeking increased ratings for service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder and chronic bronchitis.  See August 2023 VA Forms 21-526EZ.  On August 30, 2023, he filed an initial claim seeking service connection of disc degeneration.  In a March 2024 Rating Decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the claim for service connection of disc degeneration was denied based upon the lack of medical nexus to active service, and the claims for increased ratings were also denied.  No other issues were adjudicated in the March 2024 agency action.

In a March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran appealed those denials and elected the Direct Review docket.  As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, direct review by the Board without submission of additional evidence and without a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record the time of the March 2024 Rating Decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Scope of Current Appeal

On the March 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran included the issues of entitlement to service connection of migraines as well as increased ratings for tinnitus and residuals of a right hand third finger closed fracture.  The Veteran identified rating decisions dated June 2012, April 2015, and October 2015, from which he sought to appeal the issues.  

After a rating decision is issued, a Veteran must file a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) within one year from the date of that the agency mails notice of the determination. See 38 C.F.R. § 19.52(a).  Alternatively, VA will readjudicate a claim if new and material evidence is presented or secured sufficient to warrant readjudication.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5103, 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Here, the June 2012, April 2015, and October 2015 rating decisions became final.  The Veteran was notified of each decision and did not submit an NOD, to include correspondence, formal or informal, that could be construed as an NOD, or new and material evidence in connection with the claims contained in the rating decisions within the appeal period.  Additionally, the Veteran has not alleged clear and unmistakable error in the June 2012, April 2015, or October 2015 rating decisions.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

Given the above, the Board finds that the appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection of migraines and for increased ratings for tinnitus and residuals of a right hand third finger closed fracture are not before the Board.  The appeal was not timely submitted, the Veteran did not provide good cause for doing so, and neither he, nor his representative has requested an extension of time in which to appeal those issues.  Consequently, good cause has not been demonstrated and the Board finds the issues of entitlement to service connection of migraines and increased ratings for tinnitus and residuals of a right hand third finger closed fracture are not before the Board.

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection requires evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply.  Id. at 781-82.

Disc Degeneration

The Veteran contends that his diagnosed thoracolumbar spine degenerative joint disease with degenerative disc disease is attributable to overuse in service, to include carrying heavy loads while on patrols in Iraq.  See August 2023 VA 21-526EZ.  The medical evidence confirms that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of thoracolumbar spine degenerative joint disease with degenerative disc disease (DDD) other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS).  See December 2023 VA Compensation and Pension (C&P) Examination.  Thus, the first element of service connection has been established.  See Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a).

As to element two, although the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are negative for complaints/symptoms, diagnosis of, or treatment for a spinal condition, at a December 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his back pain onset in 2003, as a result of carrying heavy loads while on patrol in Iraq.  The Board finds the Veteran's competent and credible reports of lifting and carrying heavy items consistent with his duties in service (Chemical Ops MOS).  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  Based on the Veteran's credible statements, in conjunction with the nature and circumstances incident to his military service in the U.S. Army, the Board finds the evidence establishes that the onset of his DDD manifested during active service.  Having established a current disability and in-service incurrence, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's DDD disability has a nexus to his military service.

As to element three, a medical nexus, in an August 2023 private medical opinion, the Veteran's treating physician opined that given the severity and nature of his chronic lower back pain, it is more than likely a direct result of his physical activity and duties during military service.  As noted above, the Veteran has credibly stated that he experiences recurrent back pain which impacts his daily activities.

Conversely, in a December 2023 VA medical opinion, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's degenerative arthritis with DDD of the lumbar spine were less likely than not incurred in service and relied exclusively on the Veteran's August 2011 and January 2012 separation assessments wherein he denied an active back condition.  The Board assigns minimal probative weight to the VA medical opinion as it failed to address both the private medical opinion and the Veteran's contentions regarding onset of and continuation of symptoms from active service to present and provided no medical explanation for the presence of the diagnosed disability.  Based on the incompleteness of the opinions, the Board accords the VA medical opinion minimal probative weight.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (a medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21Vet. App.120, 124-25 (2007) (a mere conclusory opinion is insufficient to allow the Board to make an informed decision as to the weight to assign to a medical opinion).

Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds the private medical opinion and statements of the Veteran regarding in-service onset and persistent symptomology of back pain competent and credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  Based on the Veteran's statements that he has experienced back pain from 2003, plus the medical evidence reflecting a long-term condition, the Board finds that a nexus is established.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776; see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  As such, entitlement to service connection of thoracolumbar spine degenerative joint disease with degenerative disc disease is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which allows for ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history, and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Examination reports are to be interpreted considering the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of a veteran working or seeking work.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2.

Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  To evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of a veteran's condition.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The Board must also assess the competence and credibility of lay statements and testimony.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007).  In increased rating claims, a veteran's lay statements alone, absent a negative credibility determination, may constitute competent evidence of worsening, when such statements pertain to observable symptoms.  See Vazquez-Flores v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 94, 102 (2010).  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations is to be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Staged ratings are appropriate for an initial or increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-127 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The assignment of a particular diagnostic code is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case."  See Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993).  One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the current diagnosis and demonstrated symptomatology.  Any change in a diagnostic code by VA must be specifically explained.  Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625 (1992).

Evaluation of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (DC 9411)

The Veteran contends that his service-connected PTSD has worsened.  See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  In a June 2012 Rating Decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection of PTSD with alcohol dependency in short term remission (hereinafter PTSD) and assigned an initial 70 percent rating, effective November 6, 2011, under Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ claim for increased ratings on August 23, 2023.  Therefore, the period on appeal runs from that date plus the one year "look back" period preceding the submission of the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Under the General Schedule for Mental Disorders found at 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, the Board must conduct an "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017).  The symptoms listed in the VA's general rating formula for mental disorders are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, which would justify a particular rating.  Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages.  Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating.  See Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 114.

The pertinent sections for evaluation of the Veteran's PTSD disability are as follows:

70 percent: Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation, obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech that is intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

100 percent: Total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, for the Veteran's own occupation, or own name.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

The use of the term "such as" in the general rating formula for mental disorders in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating.  See Mauerhan 16 Vet. App. at 442.  It is not required to find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms recited for particular ratings.  Id.  Rather, the use of the phrase "such symptoms as," followed by a list of examples, provides guidance as to the severity of symptoms contemplated for each rating, in addition to permitting consideration of other symptoms, particular to each veteran and disorder, and the effect of those symptoms on the claimant's social and work situation.  Id.

In Vazquez-Claudio, the Federal Circuit reiterated that "a veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration."  713 F.3d at 112.  It was further noted that "§ 4.130 requires not only the presence of certain symptoms but also that those symptoms have caused occupational and social impairment in most of the referenced areas."  Id.

Analysis

The Veteran was afforded a VA PTSD Examination in December 2023, wherein he reported that he was living in a "camper" in his front yard while undergoing a difficult divorce and separation from his wife and two children, aged 14 and 25 years.  He reported that he works as a firefighter, receives mental health services, and has been sober for approximately 6 months.

The VA examiner confirmed that the Veteran suffers from more than one mental disorder, to include alcohol dependency (six months sober) but that his alcohol use is a symptom of PTSD and is subsumed in the PTSD diagnosis.  The examiner reported the Veteran appeared moderately depressed and anxious but was cooperative during the examination.  The examiner found the Veteran's PTSD symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur more than once per week, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of short and long-term memory, memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name, flattened affect, circumstantial, circumlocutory or stereotyped speech, difficulty in understanding complex commands, impaired judgment and abstract thinking, gross impairment in thought processes or communication, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, and obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities.  He denied suicidal or homicidal ideation, and hallucinations.

In terms of social functioning, the Veteran reported living in a camper in his front yard and being amid a difficult divorce and separation from him children.  Occupationally, he reported working as a firefighter.  The examiner concluded that his symptomology resulted in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  As noted above, the Veteran's PTSD has been rated at 70 percent under DC 9411 from the date of the award of service connection.  Here, the examiner opined that the Veteran's overall PTSD symptoms have worsening, but no change to the diagnosis and no additional diagnoses were found.

It is well-settled that a veteran need not exhibit all the symptoms listed in the criteria for a certain rating percentage to be entitled to that rating.  See Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 436.  Rather, the Board must holistically assess the severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms of the Veteran's disability, quantify the level of impairment it causes, and assign the rating that most nearly approximates the Veteran's level of impairment.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a).  Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that the Veteran's disability picture, to include the severity, frequency, and duration of his symptoms, as well as the resulting impairment of social and occupational functioning, approximates total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; memory loss for names of close relatives, for the Veteran's own occupation, or own name, and obsessional rituals that interfere with routine activities.  The Board is further persuaded by the Veteran's current social functioning factors, including residing in a camper in his yard and the breakdown of his family unit.  Given the above, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms are indicative of total occupational and social impairment.  Therefore, a maximum, 100 percent rating is warranted for PTSD, from August 23, 2023, the date of claim.  The medical evidence does not support an effective date prior to the date of claim for the assignment of the higher rating.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776; see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  As such, entitlement to a maximum 100 percent rating for service-connected PTSD, from August 23, 2023, is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Lastly, the Board finds that application of the regular schedular standards is adequate to rate this single service-connected disability and that the disability is not so exceptional or unusual as to render the schedular standards impractical.  Thus, extra-schedular consideration is not warranted in this case.  38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1).?

Chronic Bronchitis

The Veteran contends that his service-connected bronchitis has worsened.  See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  In a June 2012 Rating Decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection of bronchitis and assigned an initial 10 percent rating, effective November 6, 2011, under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6600.

VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ claim for an increased rating on August 23, 2023.  Therefore, the period on appeal runs from that date plus the one year "look back" period preceding the submission of the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston, 605 F.3d at 982.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6600, a 10 percent rating is warranted where Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV-1), or the ratio of FEV-1 to Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), is 71 to 80 percent of predicted; or the Diffusion capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide by the Single Breath method (DLCO (SB)) is 66 to 80 percent of predicted.  A 30 percent rating under DC 6600 is warranted where FEV-1, or the ratio of FEV-1 to FVC, is 56 to 70 percent of predicted; or DLCO (SB) is 56 to 65 percent of predicted.  A 60 percent rating under DC 6600 is warranted where FEV-1, or the ratio of FEV-1 to FVC, or DLCO (SB) is 40 to 55 percent of predicted; or there is maximum oxygen consumption of 15 to 20 ml/kg/min (with cardiorespiratory limit).  A maximum 100 percent rating under DC 6600 is warranted where FEV-1, or the ratio of FEV-1 to FVC, or DLCO (SB) is less than 40 percent of predicted; or maximum exercise capacity is less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption (with cardiac or respiratory limitation); or cor pulmonale (right heart failure); or right ventricular hypertrophy; or pulmonary hypertension (shown by Echo or cardiac catheterization); or episode(s) of acute respiratory failure; or requiring outpatient oxygen therapy.

Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) results are generally reported before and after the administration of bronchodilator therapy.  VA regulations require the use of post-bronchodilator results in determining disability ratings for DCs 6600, 6603, 6604, 6825-6833, and 6840-6845, unless post-bronchodilator results are poorer than pre-bronchodilator results.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(4).  When there is a disparity between the results of different PFTs so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, use the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflect the level of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(6).

Analysis

The Veteran was afforded a VA Respiratory Conditions Examination in December 2023.  He reported experiencing shortness of breath, expiratory wheezing and chest tightness with exertion and denied use of treatment for his respiratory disability.

According to the examiner, the Veteran's chronic bronchitis does not require the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medications, oral bronchodilators, antibiotics, or outpatient oxygen therapy.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran experienced chronic bronchitis with intermittent shortness of breath, wheezing and chest tightness.  A January 2024 chest x-ray reflected diffuse airway thickening consistent with bronchitis and January 2024 (pre-bronchodilator) PFT results demonstrated a FVC of 68 percent predicted, FEV-1 of 67 percent predicted, and FEV-1/FVC of 77 percent.  The DLCO was not completed because it was not valid for the Veteran's particular case.  The examiner determined that the FEV-1/FVC test result (77 percent) most accurately reflected the Veteran's pulmonary function.  The examiner further found that the Veteran's bronchitis does not impact his ability to work.  

Given the above, the Board finds that the Veteran's chronic bronchitis manifests to a degree of 10 percent.  The results from the PFT show an FEV-1/FVC ratio of 77 percent, pre-bronchodilator, which is within range for a 10 percent rating under DC 6600, which requires an FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent.  There is no evidence of cor pulmonale, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, acute respiratory failure, or outpatient oxygen therapy.  While the Veteran reports shortness of breath, wheezing and chest tightness, the December 2023 examiner noted that the FEV-1/FVC score from the January 2024 PFT test, which the examiner stated was the most representative, was 77 percent predicted, which is more than the level of limitation contemplated by higher ratings for bronchitis.  Based on the foregoing, the persuasive weight of the evidence is against a finding that a rating in excess of 10 percent for chronic bronchitis is warranted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.96, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6600.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  However, as the evidence is not in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.  Rather, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim for entitlement to an increased rating for chronic bronchitis.  Because the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

Entitlement to Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)

Considering the Board's increased rating grant to 100 percent for PTSD, SMC benefits at the housebound rate are to be considered.  SMC is payable at the housebound rate where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling and, in addition: (1) has a service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability, and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

Pursuant to this decision, the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent disability rating for PTSD from August 23, 2023.  However, the combined rating for his other service-connected disabilities is less than the 60 percent required for SMC.  He is service connected for residuals of a right finger closed fracture, evaluated as 10 percent disabling from November 6, 2011; tinnitus, evaluated as 10 percent disabling from November 6, 2011, bronchitis rated as 10 percent disabling from November 6, 2011, and left upper forehead soft tissue mass as 10 percent disabling from November 6, 2011.  The combined rating for these disabilities from November 6, 2011, is 30 percent.  As the Veteran's service-connected disabilities other than PTSD do not have a combined rating of 60 percent or more, SMC is not warranted.

SMC may also be warranted if a veteran, by reason of his service-connected disabilities, is permanently housebound.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).  Here, the evidence does not reflect that the Veteran is substantially confined to his house.  May 2022 through December 2023 private treatment records, along with a December 2023 VA examination, note that the Veteran reported working as a firefighter.  The evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has been housebound for the period on appeal.  Thus, SMC at the housebound rate is not warranted.

Finally, the Board has considered whether an inferred claim for a total disability based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) has been raised pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  Neither the Veteran nor his representative allege that he is unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment. Indeed, the record shows he has been employed as a firefighter throughout the period on appeal.  The issue of a TDIU does not arise in the context of an increased rating claim when there is no allegation or evidence of unemployability.  See Jackson v. Shinseki, 587 F.3d 1106 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (no evidence indicating unemployability, i.e. veteran was employed, a TDIU claim was not raised.)  As such, a Rice claim is not raised and neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 36970 (2017).
