ORDER

Service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

Service connection for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's currently diagnosed migraine headaches disability had its onset during, and is directly related to, his active service.

2. The Veteran's hypertension is not related to his active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for migraine headaches have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309. 

2. The criteria for service connection for hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1984 to July 1984, from May 1985 to August 1985, and from January 1991 to June 1991, with additional service in the United States Army Reserve from December 1983 to October 1996.

In a July 2023 rating decision, the RO reconsidered the claims on appeal but confirmed and continued the previous denials of service connection for headaches (migraines) and hypertension.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) Higher-Level Review rating decision.  This rating decision was based on the evidence of record at the time of the underlying July 2023 rating decision for which the higher-level review was requested.  In that decision, the RO confirmed and continued the prior denial of service connection for headaches (migraines) and hypertension. 

In July 2024, VA received the Veteran's 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD). The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Direct Review docket does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Thus, the record closed as of the March 2024 rating decision.

Evidence added during an ineligible period will not be considered.  Should the Veteran want VA to consider evidence submitted outside the eligible period, the Veteran should submit a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, identifying such evidence.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"- the so-called "nexus" requirement."  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection for certain chronic diseases may also be established based upon a legal "presumption" by showing that the disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  In addition, service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after service when all the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected condition.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  "Symptoms, not treatment, are the essence of any evidence of continuity of symptomatology."  See Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 496 (1997) (citing Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991)).

1. Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches

The Veteran contends that his migraine headaches are related to his active service, to include as due to heat exposure on a 15 mile road march.  He began having headaches during service and they continue to the present.  The Veteran was eventually referred to a neurologist in June 1984.  See January 27, 2022, VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, see also March 25, 2024, HLR - Informal Conference.

In the February 2023 statement, the Veteran stated that his headaches were diagnosed while in service and on active duty.  He asserted that STRs revealed a June 23, 1984, diagnosis, while he was on active duty.  See February 28, 2023, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  In the September 2022, July 2023, and March 2024 rating decisions, the RO provided favorable findings that the Veteran was diagnosed with a disability (VA examination conducted June 2022 demonstrates a diagnosis of migraine headaches) and that participation in a toxic exposure risk activity was conceded (exposure to exhaust fumes and diesel fuel).

A July 27, 1984, military personnel record shows that the Veteran's effective date of entry on active duty was May 23, 1984, and that his tour of duty terminated on July 27, 1984.  Service treatment records (STRs) and military personnel records show that the Veteran served on active duty from May 1985 to August 1985 and January 1991 to June 1991.  A June 23, 1984, service record shows an impression of migraine syndrome after the Veteran complained of headaches that developed while on 15 mile road march.  See January 26, 2022, STR, see also January 26, 2022, Military Personnel Record; August 11, 2022, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty; August 11, 2022, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty (2).

The Veteran underwent a June 2022 VA examination for his headache disability.  The examiner noted a diagnosis of migraines including migraine variants from June 23, 1984.  The Veteran experiences headaches about three times per week.  The examiner noted that if the Veteran was on active duty at that time, then his headaches are at least as likely as not related to his service.  See June 30, 2022, C&P Examination.

The remaining June 2023 VA opinion of record addresses whether the Veteran's headaches are related to the conceded TERA exposure.  See June 28, 2023, C&P Examination.  However, as the record clearly shows that the Veteran was performing active duty service at the time of the June 23, 1984, diagnosis of headaches, a discussion of other theories of entitlement to service connection for this disability is not necessary. 

The Board affords the June 2022 VA opinion high probative value as the examiner reviewed the entire file, considered the Veteran's statements, and provided a clear rationale for the provided opinion.  As noted above, the Veteran was, in fact, on active duty service for the period from May 1984 to July 1984, including the date of his confirmed diagnosis of migraine headaches on June 23, 1984.

The record does not provide any competent medical evidence to indicate otherwise.  Based on the above, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of migraine headaches, and the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's currently diagnosed headaches began during his active service and are at least as likely as not related to his active service.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that evidence weighs in favor of the Veteran's claim that his current migraine headache disability is related to his active service.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for migraine headaches is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claim is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension

The Veteran contends that his claimed hypertension is related to his active service, to include as due to training exercises and toxic agents.  He stated that his blood pressure went up and he had to spend a night in the hospital, in July 1999.  See January 27, 2022, VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

The Veteran asserts that his STRs include evidence of high blood pressure prior to 1996.  He specified that the records show blood pressure readings of 140/66 on December 23, 1983; 132/80 on June 25, 1984, 140/76 on July 13, 1984; 120/80 on July 16, 1984; 118/84 on December 7, 1984; and 144/98 on August 25, 1996.  See February 28, 2023, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

Moreover, the Veteran asserts that the decision regarding hypertension was incorrect because it found that his hypertension was due to his diet even though, at the time of his diagnosis, he was in the best shape of his life.  Rather, he asserts that his hypertension was aggravated by his active duty.  See March 25, 2024, HLR - Informal Conference.

The September 2022, July 2023, and March 2024 rating decisions provide favorable findings that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension per the June 2022 VA examination and that participation in a toxic exposure risk activity was conceded (exposure to exhaust fumes and diesel fuel). 

The STRs pertaining to periods of active service show blood pressure readings of 110/68 on June 23, 1984; 132/80 on June 25, 1984; and 124/58 on May 24, 1991.  Shortly after one period of active service, the Veteran's blood pressure was 118/84 on July 12, 1984, and 120/80 on July 16, 1984.  See January 26, 2022, STR.  The STRs pertaining to periods of the Veteran's active service do not include any notations of complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to hypertension.

Review of the Veteran's STRs during his service in the Reserves reveals blood pressure readings of 144/98 on August 25, 1996; 140/66 on December 23, 1983.  See April 6, 2022, STR - Reserves STR. 

The Veteran underwent a June 2022 VA examination for hypertension.  The examiner noted a diagnosis of hypertension from August 1996.  The examiner noted that the first evidence of hypertension in STRs was in 1996.  The examiner concluded that if the Veteran was on active duty during that time, then it is at least as likely as not related to his service.  See June 30, 2022, C&P Examination.

The May 2023 VA examiner stated that he was asked to offer a medical opinion as to whether this Veteran's blood pressure during the 1985 and/or 1991 periods could be diagnosed as hypertension.  The examiner noted that for VA disability rating purposes, hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly greater that 90 mmHg, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly greater than 160 mmHg or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mmHg.  Furthermore, a diagnosis of hypertension (or isolated systolic hypertension) must be confirmed by blood pressure readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.  The examiner noted that the regulations direct that the purpose of this requirement is to "assure that the existence of hypertension is not conceded based solely on readings taken on a single, perhaps unrepresentative, day."  The examiner found that the Veteran's blood pressure readings during his active duty service periods do not meet the noted criteria.  Thus, the examiner opined that, based on the evidence of record, it is less likely than not that this Veteran's blood pressure during the 1985 and/or 1991 periods could be diagnosed as hypertension.  See May 27, 2023, C&P Examination. 

The May 2023 VA examiner opined that the claimed hypertension, which existed prior to service, was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated beyond its natural progression by an in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner's rationale was that "as the VA itself has specifically clarified in the other opinion request, this [Veteran's] hypertension was NOT verified as existing prior to service (emphasis in original)."  Notably, the referenced opinion request provided that the Veteran's hypertension was not verified as existing prior to service, but that there were elevated readings.  The Veteran was on active duty for training from May 22, 1985, to August 16, 1985, and on regular active duty from January 22, 1991, to June 18, 1991.  The RO noted multiple other blood pressure readings outside of the listed periods of active service. 

The Board acknowledges the flaw in the RO's requested opinion in May 2023, indicating that the Veteran's only periods of active service were from May 1985 to August 1985 and from January 1991 to June 1991.  As noted above, the Veteran's service records show a period of active service from May 1984 to July 1984.  However, the Board finds that this discrepancy is harmless error.  Even if the May 2023 VA examiner had considered that period of time in 1984 to be active service, the record provides no evidence of high blood pressure ratings from 1984 that would indicate hypertension.  Moreover, the examiner reviewed multiple blood pressure readings outside of the specified periods of active duty and determined that the first indication of hypertension was in 1996, at a time when the Veteran was not on active duty service. 

Regarding the Veteran's conceded TERA, the June 2023 VA examiner opined that the claimed hypertension was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.  The examiner's rationale was that the June 2022 VA examination revealed a diagnosis of hypertension, and that the first evidence of hypertension in the STRs was in 1996.  The examiner addressed the Veteran's conceded non-deployment exposure to exhaust fumes, diesel fuel, etc. during his active service as a light wheel vehicle mechanic.  The examiner explained that it has long been suggested that an increase in salt intake increases the risk of developing hypertension.  One of the described factors for the development of essential hypertension is the patient's genetic ability to salt response.  He noted that about 40 to 60% of the patients are salt sensitive and tend to develop hypertension.  The examiner determined that there was no pathophysiological and causational link between hypertension and the conceded TERA.  See June 28, 2023, C&P Examination.

While the Veteran believes that his current diagnosis of hypertension is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, he is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized knowledge.  Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that he has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the medical evidence of record, including the STRs and VA medical opinions.

While the record shows that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hypertension, the STRs do not provide evidence of high blood pressure readings, symptoms, or notations of possible hypertension during the Veteran's periods of active service that would indicate hypertension.  Regarding TERA, the examiner indicated that there is no etiological link between hypertension and the conceded TERA; rather, he indicated that hypertension is more likely due to genetic factors.  Thus, the evidence does not demonstrate that the hypertension had its onset during a period of active duty nor that it was otherwise related to his active service, to include the conceded TERA. 

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether service connection for hypertension is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
