REMANDED

The issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy manifested as moderately severe incomplete paralysis of all lumbosacral radicular groups.

2. The Veteran's left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy manifested as moderately severe incomplete paralysis of all lumbosacral radicular groups.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a rating evaluation of 40 percent, but no higher, for the period on appeal, for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8520.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a rating evaluation of 40 percent, but no higher, for the period on appeal, for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, DC 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1986 to June 1996.

This matter was initially denied in a September 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review of the September 2023 rating decision.  The AOJ again denied the Veteran's claim in the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision.

The Veteran timely filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), in June 2024, appealing the March 2024 rating decision, to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), requesting the Direct Review option.  Therefore, any evidence submitted after the September 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher level review, cannot be considered by the Board.? 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.?

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a Veteran's present symptomatology with criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  Where the Veteran is appealing the initial assignment of a disability rating, the severity of the disability is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  Where a claimant appeals the denial of a claim for an increased disability rating for a disability for which service connection was in effect before, he filed the claim for increase, the present level of disability is the primary concern, and past medical reports should not be given precedence over current medical findings.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 57-58 (1994).  

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with a veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the persuasive weight of the evidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Entitlement to a 40 percent evaluation, but no higher, for the period on appeal, for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy is granted.

2. Entitlement to a 40 percent evaluation, but no higher, for the period on appeal, for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy is granted.

Sciatic peripheral neuropathy is rated under DC 8520 provides for a 10 percent rating where there is mild incomplete paralysis (or neuralgia) of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent rating where there is moderate incomplete paralysis (or neuralgia) of the sciatic nerve; and a 40 percent rating where there is moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  A rating of 60 percent is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve with marked muscular atrophy; and complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve (where the foot dangles and drops, there is no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, and flexion of the knee is weakened or lost), warrants the highest rating of 80 percent.  

Diagnostic Code 8520 does not define the terms "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe." As these terms are similarly not expressly defined elsewhere in the rating schedule, the Board finds these terms are defined by their ordinary meaning according to the dictionary definitions set forth below. See Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015) (citing Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). As relevant here, the ordinary definition of "mild" is "moderate in action or effect," and "not severe." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1173 (11th ed. 2003). "Moderate" means "limited in scope or effect." Id. at 798. "Severe" means "of a great degree" or "very painful and harmful." Id. at 1140. Paralysis is characterized by a "loss of function." 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124, 4.124a. The note prefacing Diagnostic Codes 8510 through 8730 also provides important guidance in defining the above terms. It defines "incomplete paralysis" as a degree of lost or impaired function "substantially less" than the type picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, and instructs that when the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note prefacing Diagnostic Codes 8510 through 8730. This does not establish a minimum rating for disabilities found to be other than wholly sensory. Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017). Paralysis is characterized by a "loss of function." 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124, 4.124a. In rating peripheral nerve injuries and their residuals, attention should be given to the site and character of the injury, the relative impairment in motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120.

Here, the Veteran has been service connected for bilateral lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy since June 30, 2018, with an evaluation of 10 percent.  The Veteran filed an "Intent to File" on March 13, 2023, and subsequently filed a VA Form 21-526EZ for an increased rating for this condition in July 2023.  The Board notes that a claimant can submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim, if VA receives a complete claim form within one year.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  If submitted in writing, the intent to file must be on a standardized form.  See id.  An intent to file a claim must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension), but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition on which the claim is based.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(2).  "In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within one year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1).

That said, the RO awarded the Veteran a 20 percent rating evaluation, effective March 13, 2023, in the September 2023 rating decision and continued that evaluation in the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  The Veteran and his representative contend the Veteran is entitled to a 40 percent evaluation as of March 13, 2023, for his bilateral lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy.  The Board agrees.

The Veteran was afforded a VA Peripheral Nerves Condition Examination in September 2023, the Veteran complained of numbness, tingling, intermittent sharp pain, and difficulty ambulating.  The examiner noted moderate constant pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness in the lower extremities.  The examiner further found that the Veteran's sciatic nerve symptoms manifested in "incomplete paralysis" that is "moderately severe" - the criteria required for the 40 percent rating criteria in the diagnostic code.  The VA examiner also noted moderate constant pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness in the lower extremities and indicated that the sciatic nerve roots were involved in that pain in the VA Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) Conditions Examination afforded in September 2023.  

Unfortunately, the available medical records for the time of the appeal inside the one-year look back period, do not show an increase in the Veteran's radiculopathy symptoms.  See generally July 2022 to July 2023 VA Treatment Records (showing numbness after driving or sleeping too long and weakness); see also August 2022 VA Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) Conditions Examination Report (noting bilateral sciatic nerve involvement in the Veteran's mild constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness).

Based upon the medical evidence of record, the severity of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy most nearly comports with a finding of moderate-severe incomplete paralysis under the assigned diagnostic criteria; and there is no other evidence regarding the increasing severity of the bilateral lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy during the evidentiary window.

The Board finds that for the period on appeal, the severity of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy disability more nearly comports with a finding of "moderately severe" impairment under the assigned criteria at DC 8520, which supports a rating of 40 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  A rating of 60 percent or higher under DC 8520 is not warranted as the medical evidence found no muscular atrophy.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. The issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is remanded.

Concerning the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, the Board finds that the determination with respect to the increased rating claim herein may affect the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU on a schedular basis.  As such, it is inextricably intertwined with the claim being remanded and must be remanded.  Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991).

The VA regulation defining eligibility for a TDIU is 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 as discussed above. This regulation, however, does not define the procedure by which a Veteran may claim a TDIU.  Instead, VA practice and case law have defined two ways formal and informal.  A formal claim exists when VA receives a VA Form 21-8940. An informal claim, in contrast, is created pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  Rice holds that a claim for a TDIU is part and parcel of any open rating issue (initial or increased) when unemployability is expressly raised by a veteran or reasonably raised by the record during the rating appeal, and it attaches for the entire rating period.  Remand may also be proper if the issue is inextricably intertwined provided no development is ordered for the inextricably intertwined issue.

Here, a claim for a TDIU has been reasonably raised by the record as part and parcel of the Veteran's July 13, 2023, request for an increase for his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, in accordance with Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  Therefore, the Board finds that the issue of TDIU is inextricably intertwined with the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).

Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total when the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disability, provided that if there is only one such disability, such disability shall be ratable as 60 percent or more and if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

For the above purpose of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, or of one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable, (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident, (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g. orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric, (4) multiple injuries incurred in action, or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Board finds that the Veteran now meets the schedular requirements for TDIU.  For the period on appeal, service connection was in effect as follows: bowel incontinence associated with degenerative disc disease, rated at 30 percent from June 12, 2018; urinary incontinence associated with degenerative disc disease, rated at 20 percent from June 12, 2018; degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with intervertebral disc syndrome, rated at 20 percent from July 23, 2023; erectile dysfunction rated at 0 percent from June 18, 2011; and with the award issued herein, right lower extremity radiculopathy, rated at 40 percent from March 13, 2023; and left lower extremity radiculopathy, rated at 40 percent from March 13, 2023.  See supra; see also March 2024 Rating Decision Codesheet.  The combined rating for compensation is 90 percent effective March 13, 2023.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.25, 4.26.  As such, the Veteran had one disability rated at 40 percent or more, with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Therefore, for the period on appeal, the Veteran met the schedular TDIU requirements. 

The Board notes that, in the September 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran could not sit, walk, or stand for prolonged periods, has intermittent to constant radicular pain and weakness in his right lower leg.  The examiner further noted the Veteran has to take frequent breaks and is only able to work part-time.  see September 2023 VA Peripheral Nerve Conditions Examination Report, Section XVI, Functional Impairment.  While a TDIU rating may be granted if employment is marginal, part-time positions are not de facto marginal employment.  Whether part-time employment is marginal is determined on whether a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the poverty threshold for one person, or on a facts-found basis.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau's average poverty threshold for one person, the poverty threshold in 2023 was $15,480. 

However, the record simply does not contain sufficient evidence of the Veteran's employment status - other than the examiner's notation - upon which the Board can adjudicate a TDIU during the period on appeal at this time.

The Board emphasizes that the Veteran has not yet been determined to have been unemployable during the appellate period, only that the record contains the argument that he is unemployable and, with the award of 40 percent for both his right and left lower extremity radiculopathy herein, meets the schedular requirements for a TDIU.  Therefore, a remand is warranted for consideration of the merits of the issue in the first instance, because it is inextricably intertwined with other matters awarded herein.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Adjudicate the issue of TDIU based on the entirety of the evidence.
