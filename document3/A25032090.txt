REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for acute myelogenous leukemia is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1970 to August 1972.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Because the July 2023 rating decision on appeal was issued after February 19, 2019, it is subject to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400(a)(1); 19.2(a).

In June 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review the July 2023 rating decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for acute myelogenous leukemia, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for acute myelogenous leukemia is remanded.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service-connection for his acute myelogenous leukemia. See June 2024 VA Form 10182. Specifically, the Veteran contends he was exposed to benzbenzene, formaldehyde, and zinc chromate while removing paint and repainting during service on the USS Little Rock while drydocked in Boston, Massachusetts. See June 2024 Statement in Support of Claim; March 2023 Statement in Support of Claim.

The AOJ made several favorable findings, including: (1) the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) is conceded as the evidence shows the Veteran was exposed to chemicals due to painting and maintenance duties in service; (2) the Veteran was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia; (3) the Veteran's claimed disability is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to service; (4) the Veteran has met the minimum service requirements for presumptive service connection, as the Veteran served from September 1970 to August 1972; and (5) the Veteran's claimed issue became manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more following service. See July 2023 Rating Decision.

However, the Board cannot make a fully-informed decision on the issue of acute myelogenous leukemia because no VA examiner has adequately opined whether the Veteran's disability is related to the Veteran's TERAs. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).

For a medical opinion to be adequate, it must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. See Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). Thus, a medical opinion is adequate when it is based upon consideration of a veteran's prior medical history and examinations, and it also describes the disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claim disability will be a fully informed one. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

Here, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2023. VA also offered a TERA medical opinion in June 2023.

Having reviewed the record, the Board finds the June 2023 TERA medical opinion that followed the May 2023 VA examination inadequate.

In the report following the May 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted the Veteran was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia in 2009. The examiner did not offer a medical nexus opinion on the Veteran's leukemia in the May 2023 VA examination report.

In the June 2023 TERA medical opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's leukemia was less likely than not caused by the Veteran's TERA participation during his military occupational specialty (MOS) of paint removal/repair, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA participation. In full, the examiner reasoned:

There is no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication of a causal relationship between the development of the acute myelogenous leukemia at issue and the TERA exposures.

There are risk factors outside of military service (hereditary, congenital, post-military occupational, lifestyle (smoking, obesity, etc.) multifactorial, etc.) that outweigh the TERA(s) factors identified.

The Board finds the June 2023 TERA medical opinion to be inadequate for adjudication purposes, as the opinion is conclusory and contains an insufficient rationale. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007) (stating that a medical opinion must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can weigh, and a mere conclusion by a medical doctor is insufficient to allow the Board to make an informed decision). The examiner indicated risk factors exist outside of the Veteran's in-service exposure that outweighed the Veteran's identified TERA participation. However, the examiner did not identify which of the factors enumerated related to the Veteran acute myelogenous leukemia. The examiner then did not address why the outside risk factors identified outweighed the Veteran's identified TERA exposure. 

Further, the Board observes there is no indication in either the May 2023 VA examination report or the June 2023 TERA medical opinion that the Veteran's medical literature was considered in the formulation of the opinion. In the Veteran's March 2023 statement in support of claim, the Veteran identified several medical articles and studies. These articles purported to show a causal relationship between the Veteran's acute myelogenous leukemia and his TERA participation. No VA examiner has addressed the medical literature submitted by the Veteran. As such, there is no medical opinion in the record addressing this medical literature. In weighing this evidence, the Board notes that it cannot assert its own medical judgment in adjudicating a claim. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991).

Thus, the Board finds these deficiencies render the June 2023 TERA medical opinion inadequate, and that remand is warranted for a new medical opinion. See 38 U.S.C. §5103A; 38 C.F.R. §3.159 (c).

Additionally, the medical opinions of record do not address whether the Veteran's acute myelogenous leukemia had onset in service or is otherwise etiologically related to service. Accordingly, the examiners did not address whether the Veteran is entitled to service connection for his acute myelogenous leukemia on a direct basis. Thus, this claim requires consideration of direct entitlement to service connection. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Failure to address this theory was also a pre-decisional duty to assist error. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c)(4); 20.802(a).

Accordingly, the Board must remand to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist to obtain a medical opinion that is sufficient to make an informed decision on the claim.

?

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a new medical opinion from an appropriately qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's acute myelogenous leukemia. The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to and reviewed by the clinician. It is up to the discretion of the reviewing clinician as to whether new examination is necessary to provide an adequate opinion.

The reviewing clinician must provide an opinion as to:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's acute myelogenous leukemia was incurred in, or is otherwise related to, his active service, to include toxic exposures during painting and paint removal.

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's acute myelogenous leukemia was due to the combined synergistic effect of the Veteran's total potential toxic exposure in service.  

In rendering the opinion, the examiner should consider and explicitly discuss the Veteran's in-service toxic exposures during painting and paint removal.

The examiner should also address the medical literature submitted by the Veteran on March 24, 2023, purporting a relationship between the Veteran's acute myelogenous leukemia and toxic exposures from the Veteran's military occupational specialty as a paint remover/repairs. See March 24, 2023 Statement in Support of Claim.

The reviewing clinician is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history. Such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion. If the reviewing clinician rejects the Veteran's reports, he or she must provide an explanation for such rejection. In forming the opinion, the examiner cannot rely on the absence of medical records corroborating disability.

A complete rationale must be offered for all opinions expressed, including a discussion of the evidence and medical principles which led to the conclusions reached
