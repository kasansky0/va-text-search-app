DOCKET NO. 250225-520601
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for headaches, to include as secondary to tinnitus, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's headaches are due to his service, to include as secondary to his tinnitus.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for headaches, to include as secondary to tinnitus, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1969 to August 1971.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2025 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

In his February 2025 VA Form 10182, the Veteran waived his right to select a different Board review option and requested adjudication as soon as possible.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

This matter was previously before the Board in a November 2024 decision, where it was remanded for further development.  

This case has been advanced on the docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b) and 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.  Entitlement to service connection requires evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The VA administers the law under a broad interpretation resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Establishing secondary service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability (for which secondary service connection is sought); (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) that the current disability was either caused or aggravated by the service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

Entitlement to service connection for headaches, to include as secondary to tinnitus, is denied.

The Veteran contends that his migraines are due to his military service.  Specifically, he asserts that his migraines are secondary to his service-connected tinnitus.  See February 2025 VA Form 10182.

In a January 1970 service treatment record, the Veteran complained of headache and sick stomach.

The Veteran is currently diagnosed with headaches.  See December 2023 VA Examination Report.

The Veteran is currently service-connected for tinnitus.

The remaining inquiry is whether the Veteran's headaches are due to his service, to include as secondary to his service-connected tinnitus.

The Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's headaches are due to his service, to include as secondary to his tinnitus.

To that end, in a January 2024 VA opinion, the examiner found that the headaches were "less likely than not" incurred in or caused by the Veteran's service.  He reasoned that "without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology."  He further reasoned that there is no evidence of a chronic headache condition during service or post service, until 2023, and his diagnosis in 2020 was noted as a migraine aura without a headache.  This did "not represent a chronic headache condition." Finally, although the Veteran has provided lay statements, his statements are not sufficient "to attribute symptoms to a specific etiology."

Concerning secondary service connection and aggravation as due to tinnitus, the January 2024 examiner rendered negative opinions reasoning that the conditions of tinnitus and headache are not medically related.  Specifically, he noted that "a thorough review of medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship."  Finally, he noted that, "[w]hile it is noted that [a] headache can cause the perception of tinnitus, there is no evidence tinnitus causes or permanently aggravates headache beyond its natural progression."

The Board finds these opinions greatly probative as the examiner provided clear conclusions supported by medical literature, and the examiner took exceptional care in documenting and considering the Veteran's lay statements. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).

There is no positive medical opinion evidence of record.

Concerning the Veteran's statements that he has headaches due to his tinnitus, the Veteran has not shown that he has the specialized education, training, or experience to diagnose the claimed disability. While lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, the diagnoses and etiologies of tinnitus are complex medical matters in the field of medicine that fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Thus, the Veteran's lay statements have minimal probative value, and the medical findings have a greater probative value.

In consideration of the above evidence, the Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's headaches are due directly to his service, to include as secondary to, or aggravated by, his service-connected tinnitus.  Since the evidence is persuasive, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
