ORDER

Severance of service connection for coronary artery disease was improper, and service connection for this disability is reinstated, effective from March 27, 2023.

Severance of service connection for diabetes mellitus was improper, and service connection for this disability is reinstated, effective from March 27, 2023.

Severance of service connection for hypertension was improper, and service connection for this disability is reinstated, effective from August 10, 2022.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. By a July 2023 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) established service connection for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus, effective from March 27, 2023, and hypertension, effective from August 10, 2022.

2. By a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ severed service connection for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus, effective from March 27, 2023, and hypertension, effective from August 10, 2022, on the basis that the July 2023 rating decision contained clear and unmistakable error.  

3. The evidence of record does not show that the July 2023 rating decision contained CUE regarding the awards of service connection for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Severance of service connection for coronary artery disease was not proper, and restoration of service connection for this disability is warranted from March 27, 2023. 38 U.S.C. §§1131, 5107, 38 C.F.R. §§3.105(d), 3.303. 

2. Severance of service connection for diabetes mellitus was not proper, and restoration of service connection for this disability is warranted from March 27, 2023. 38 U.S.C. §§1131, 5107, 38 C.F.R. §§3.105(d), 3.303.

3.  Severance of service connection for hypertension was not proper, and restoration of service connection for this disability is warranted from August 10, 2022. 38 U.S.C. §§1131, 5107, 38 C.F.R. §§3.105(d), 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1960 to January 1969, which included service from April 1966 to May 1967 in Korea. See Military Personnel Record. The Veteran's military occupational specialty was Armor Crewman. See Form DD 214.

In August 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017(Appeals Modernization Act or AMA), Pub. Law 115-55, which created a new claims and appeals process for pursuing VA benefits.

The rating decision on appeal was issued by the AOJ in March 2024, implementing an earlier proposal to sever service connection for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus, effective from March 27, 2023, and hypertension, effective from August 10, 2022, based on CUE in a July 2023 rating decision. In December 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), reflecting his wishes to appeal the severance of service connection for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension to the Board of Veteran's Appeals (Board) via the Hearing docket. 

In April 2025, the Veteran participated in a Board hearing under the AMA which was conducted by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) via videoconferencing equipment. As per the AMA, the Board may consider evidence received by VA prior to the issuance of the March 2024 rating decision and within 90 days of completion of the April 2025 hearing. 

Presumptive Service Connection

For certain enumerated diseases, including diabetes mellitus, type II, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, service connection may also be established on a presumptive basis as due to in-service exposure to herbicide agents.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e).  There is a presumption of actually being exposed to the herbicide agents for covered service performed in the Republic of Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Guam or American Samoa, or the Korean DMZ  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6).

A Veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in or near the DMZ, during the period beginning September 1, 1967, and ending on August 31, 1971, shall be presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents, unless there is affirmative evidence that he was not exposed.  38 U.S.C. §1116B.  Once exposure to herbicides has been established by the evidence of record, the presumption of service connection found in 38 C.F.R. §3.309(e) for herbicide-related diseases is applicable.

VA regulations further provide that a veteran who had active military, naval, or air service between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, in a unit that the Department of Defense (DoD) has determined to have operated in or near the DMZ in an area in which herbicides are known to have been applied during that period, shall be presumed to have been exposed to herbicides unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the Veteran was not exposed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(iv).  

Propriety of severance of service connection for coronary heart disease, effective March 27, 2023, based on CUE in a March 2024 rating decision.

Propriety of severance of service connection for diabetes mellitus, effective March 27, 2023, based on CUE in a March 2024 rating decision.

Propriety of severance of service connection for hypertension, effective August 10, 2022, based on CUE in a March 2024 rating decision.

In order to sever a grant of service connection, VA must demonstrate that the grant was clearly and unmistakably erroneous and that VA has followed the applicable procedural safeguards. 38 C.F.R. §3.105 (d). The evidentiary standard for CUE has been analyzed in a number of the Court's opinions. Most of these address the appeals of claimants seeking a finding of CUE in a past denial of benefits. However, it has been held that the standard is equally applicable to VA where the issue is severance of service connection based on CUE. Once service connection has been granted, section §3.105(d) provides that it may be withdrawn only after VA has complied with specific procedures and the Secretary meets his high burden of proof. Baughman v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 563, 566 (1991) ("In effect, §3.105(d) places at least as high a burden of proof on the VA when it seeks to sever service connection as §3.105(a) places upon an appellant seeking o have an unfavorable previous determination overturned."). 

There is a three-part test to determine whether a prior decision is the product of CUE: (1) "[e]ither the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before the adjudicator (i.e., more than a simple disagreement as to how facts were weighed or evaluated) or the statutory or regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied," (2) the error must be "undebatable" and of the sort "which, had it not been made, would have manifestly changed the outcome at the time it was made," and (3) a determination that there was CUE must be based on the record and law that existed at the time of the prior adjudication in question. Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994) (quoting Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992) (en banc)). Wilson v. West, 11 Vet. App. 383, 386 (1998). 

The Court has clarified that although the same standards applied in a determination of CUE in a final decision are applied to a determination whether a decision granting service connection was the product of CUE for the purpose of severing service connection, 3.105(d) does not limit the reviewable evidence to that which was before the AOJ in making its initial service connection award. In fact, 38 C.F.R. 3.105(d) specifically states that "[a] change in diagnosis may be accepted as a basis for severance," clearly contemplating the consideration of evidence acquired after the original granting of service connection. Daniels v. Gover, 10 Vet. App. 474, 480 (1998). 

Factual Background and Analysis

As stated above, the Veteran's active duty included being stationed in Korea from April 1966 to May 1967. 

The Veteran's medical records indicate that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in 1999. The Veteran experienced chest pain and was diagnosed with coronary artery disease in 2005. He subsequently underwent angioplasty in 2005, double bypass surgery in 2007, and implantation of a pacemaker in 2018. He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2020. The Veteran was also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus in 2005 and found to have diabetic nephropathy (chronic kidney disease) in 2017.

In March 2023, the Veteran filed a claim to establish service connection for coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, asserting that these conditions were presumed by VA to be associated with Agent Orange exposure while serving in Korea, particularly in or around the DMZ.  The Veteran submitted a Statement in Support of Claim explaining that he frequently made trips and spent days at the DMZ in Korea. He asserted that he was exposed to Agent Orange during that time and his coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are related.

In July 2023, the Veteran was provided with a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection of diabetes mellitus. In September 2023, the Veteran was provided a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection of coronary heart disease. 

In July 2023, the AOJ established service connection for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus, effective March 27, 2023, and hypertension, effective August 10, 2022, on the basis of presumption due to herbicide exposure based on his presumed in-service exposure to an herbicide agent while serving in or around the DMZ in Korea. 

In October 2023, a VA professional researcher reviewed sources in an attempt to substantiate the Veteran's toxic exposure in Korea from April 1966 to May 1967. The researcher was unable to locate records for the Veteran's unit throughout 1967, therefore the research found no evidence of exposure during the qualifying time period (September 1, 1967, to August 31, 1971).

In November 2023, the AOJ requested a rework of the previous examinations for coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. A TERA medical opinion was also requested. The examiner was asked to disregard the July 2023 rating decision because service connection was prematurely awarded and "the Veteran does NOT have verified Agent Orange exposure."  The examiner responded with an addendum, pointing out a July 2023 TERA memorandum in the Veteran's file indicating Agent Orange exposure. (The examiner provides an additional opinion that the Veteran's coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are less likely than not due to the toxic exposures (i.e. fuels, lubricants, solvents, bug repellant, exhaust gun powder and asbestos) cited in the October 2023 TERA memorandum.

In November 2023, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination. The examiner opined that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and hypertension were at least as likely as not caused by toxic exposure risk activities (TERA). The examiner's rationale was that July 2023 TERA documents were remarkable for a positive TERA event due to herbicide exposure. The examiner also found that "there is strong medical and scientific evidence that provides a causative link between the TERA and hypertension, ischemic heart disease and diabetes."

It appears that a review of the Veteran's claim file was performed in December 2023, and a clear and unmistakable error was identified in the AOJ's awarding of service connection for these three disabilities based on Agent Orange exposure in the July 2023 rating decision. Thus, a December 2023 rating decision was issued, proposing the severance of service connection for coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus as of March 27, 2023, and hypertension as of August 10, 2022 (the date of service connection). 

In a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the proposed severance of service connection for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus, effective from March 27, 2023, and hypertension, effective from August 10, 2022, on the basis that the July 2023 Rating decision contained CUE in determining that the Veteran had toxic exposure to Agent Orange while serving in Korea because the evidence did not show service in or around the DMZ.

In December 2024, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement appealing the severance of service connection. In an April 2025 hearing, the Veteran testified that he served in the Korean DMZ from April 1966 to May 1967. He described how the companies would rotate their duties to set up radar along the DMZ, with each company performing duties every 90 days. He testified that there were no crops or vegetation in the surrounding area, and he could hear the engines of North Korean soldiers nearby.

In sum, the basis of the AOJ's severance of service connection in the March 2024 rating decision was that the correct facts were not known to the fact finder (the AOJ) at the time of the July 2023 rating decision which established service connection for coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and therefore, there was CUE within the allowances. More specifically, the AOJ found in the March 2024 rating decision that the July 2023 rating decision contained CUE in determining that the Veteran had Agent Orange exposure while serving in the DMZ because service in the DMZ had not been confirmed.  

In this case, the Veteran testified that he was in the Korean DMZ during qualifying time period for the presumption of herbicide exposure. There is nothing in the evidence of record that refute his testimony or prove that he was not in the DMZ zone at that time.  Simply to find CUE on the basis that the previous adjudication improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE. Fugo v. Brown, 6. Vet. App. 40, 44 (1993).

In short, it cannot be said that either the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before the adjudicator in July 2023 or that the statutory or regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied. Thus, as the July 2023 rating decision that granted service connection for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension did not contain clear and unmistakable error, the severance of service connection for these disabilities was improper. Consequently, the restoration of service connection for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension is warranted from the effective dates of severance assigned by the AOJ.  These awards shall be reinstated from the effective dates assigned in the July 2023 rating decision as implementation of the Board's allowance.  The Veteran's appealed issues are granted.
