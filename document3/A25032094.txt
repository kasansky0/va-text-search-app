ORDER

The issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's August 2020 notice of disagreement seeking entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome did not identify a Board decision to be reconsidered, any error of law or fact in a prior Board decision, any new and material evidence in the form of relevant records or reports of the service department concerned, or any allegation that an allowance of benefits by the Board had been materially influenced by false or fraudulent evidence submitted by or on behalf of the appellant. 

2. The August 2020 notice of disagreement is not considered to be a motion for reconsideration.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the dismissal of the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from April 1997 to June 2000.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2020 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that in pertinent part effectuated a May 2020 Board decision denying entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome.

In the August 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

A February 2024 Board decision continued to deny a rating in excess of 10 percent for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome.

The Veteran appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In a November 2024 Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) the parties agreed that the Board's decision should be vacated.  In December 2024, the Court vacated the Board's decision and remanded the issue to the Board for action consistent with the JMR.  The claim has been returned to the Board for appellate review. 

1. Reconsideration of the May 2020 Board decision denying entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome is denied.

In December 2024, this matter was remanded to the Board from the Court with instructions to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases regarding whether the Veteran's August 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD) was a motion for reconsideration of a May 2020 Board decision that denied entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome.

In May 2020, the Board issued a decision that denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome and granted an increased rating from 10 percent to 30 percent for left wrist carpal tunnel syndrome.   In a May 2020 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) effectuated the Board's grant of an increased rating for left wrist carpal tunnel syndrome and the denial of an increased rating for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome.  Appellant filed a NOD in August 2020, which challenged the denial of an increased rating for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome.  In the decision on appeal, the Board recognized that the "May 2020 RO decision implemented the Board's decision," and adjudicated the issue of an increased rating for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome on the merits.

An AOJ implementation of a Board decision is not appealable.  See Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194, 201-02 (2023), overruled on other grounds by Kernz v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 372 (2023).   However, when a claimant files a NOD in response to an AOJ decision that effectuates a Board decision within the 120-day period to submit a Notice of Appeal, the Court has held that the Board must address whether the NOD is a motion for reconsideration.  Encarnacion, 36 Vet. App. at 201-02.  

Reconsideration of a final Board decision can be granted at any time by the Board on motion by the appellant or his or her representative or on the Board's own motion based on substantiation of an allegation of obvious error of fact or law, upon discovery of new and material evidence in the form of relevant records or reports of the service department concerned, or upon allegation that an allowance of benefits by the Board has been materially influenced by false or fraudulent evidence submitted by or on behalf of the appellant.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1001.    

A motion for reconsideration must be in writing and must include: (1) the name of the Veteran; (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) the date of the Board's decision to be reconsidered.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1001(a); Kouvaris v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 377 (2009).  The motion for reconsideration must also be filed at the appropriate address for the Board.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1001 and 20.1000.  The motion must set forth clearly and specifically the alleged obvious error, or errors, of fact or law in the applicable decision, or decisions, of the Board or other appropriate basis for requesting reconsideration.  If the applicable Board of Veterans' Appeals decision, or decisions, involved more than one issue on appeal, the motion for reconsideration must identify the specific issue, or issues, to which the motion pertains.  Issues not so identified will not be considered in the disposition of the motion.  Id.

The NOD at issue here does not meet the above requirements as the August 2020 VA Form 10182 identifies the decision the Veteran is seeking to appeal as the May 2020 rating decision that implemented the Board's May 2020 decision, not the Board's decision itself.  More importantly, the Board notes that the Veteran has not clearly and specifically identified an obvious error of fact or law in the May 2020 Board decision, new and material evidence in the form of relevant records or reports of the service department concerned, or evidence that an allowance of benefits by the Board has been materially influenced by false or fraudulent evidence submitted by or on behalf of the appellant.  The Veteran's allegation of error amounts to nothing more than a restatement of the decision itself, to wit, "Evaluation of wrist (right) carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) which is currently 10% disabling is continued."  See 10182 Notice of Disagreement, August 2020.  The Veteran simply disagrees with how the evidence in her claim was weighed and believes VA's assessment of her disability is inconsistent with her own subjective opinion of her condition's severity.  Without more, the Board is left to speculate what errors of fact or law the Veteran may be asserting.  

For the reasons detailed above, the Board finds that the August 2020 VA Form 10182 cannot be considered a motion for reconsideration of the Board's May 2020 decision.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
