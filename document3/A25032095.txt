REMANDED

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including as secondary to service-connected bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Army from May 1971 to May 1974.

This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that denied service connection for a psychiatric disorder, described as insomnia.

In May 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an October 2023 decision. The Veteran was notified of that decision by a letter dated in early November 2023. In August 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR rating decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 decision. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for and acquired psychiatric disorder, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board acknowledges that it is issuing a remand in this appeal before the deadline for requesting an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024); 38 C.F.R.               § 20.202(c)(2) (allowing a claimant to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new Notice of Disagreement (NOD) within one year from the date AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives the NOD, whichever is later; unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303). However, in November 2024, the Veteran's representative submitted a signed waiver of this period, and the Board will therefore proceed with adjudication.

1. Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder, anxiety, and PTSD, including as secondary to service-connected bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that he has a current psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, anxiety, depression, and insomnia, that is related to service. Alternatively, he asserts that his psychiatric disorder is proximately due to or aggravated by his service-connected bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. See his May 2023 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995), May 2023 statement, May 2023 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526EZ), May 2024 correspondence, and August 2024 NOD.

The Board has expanded the scope of the Veteran's claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder as reflected on the title page to include consideration of all disabilities reasonably raised by the record. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (holding that the scope of a disability claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record); Murphy v. Wilkie, 983 F.3d 1313, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (explaining that, to comply with the Clemons lenient-claim-scope rule, "VA must look to all possible diseases or injuries for which the veteran could have reasonably expected to have included in the filing"). 

The issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. The AOJ obtained an August 2023 VA mental disorders examination and medical opinion prior to the rating decision on appeal. However, this medical opinion is inadequate. The examiner provided a negative medical opinion primarily based on the lack of a current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder at the August 2023 VA examination. 

However, the requirement that a Veteran have a current disability before service connection may be awarded is satisfied if the Veteran has a disability at the time the claim for disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). VA outpatient treatment records and prior VA compensation examinations reflect that the Veteran has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, other specified depressive disorder, simple phobia (fear of flying), persistent depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, and anxiety, and has consistently complained of insomnia. See VA outpatient treatment records dated in January 2019, July 2020, and May 2023, January 2019 VA examination, and February 2020 VA examination. The August 2023 VA examiner did not provide an opinion about these diagnosed psychiatric disorders.

Moreover, the August 2023 VA examiner did not provide an opinion as to whether any diagnosed psychiatric disorder was aggravated by the service-connected bilateral hearing loss and/or tinnitus. Therefore, the August 2023 VA medical opinion is inadequate, and remand is required for a supplemental medical opinion.

Although the February 2020 VA examiner diagnosed PTSD and provided a positive nexus opinion, this opinion was based on a non-combat stressor unrelated to the Veteran's military service (the traumatic loss of his older brother while the Veteran was in service). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f). That examiner also diagnosed persistent depressive disorder and alcohol use disorder, but opined that they were related to his PTSD. At the August 2023 VA examination, when the Veteran was asked about the stressors for which the 2020 PTSD diagnosis was made, he denied that those incidents were a stressor for him.  Thus, the February 2020 VA examination report is inadequate.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed psychiatric disorder(s). The examiner must review the claims file.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

(a)	For diagnosed anxiety (see May 2023 VA outpatient treatment record), depressive disorder (see January 2019 VA mental health outpatient note, January 2019 VA examination, and February 2020 VA examination), simple phobia (fear of flying) (see January 2019 VA examination), and reported insomnia, please opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability or nearly 50 percent probability) that each disorder:

(i)	had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service. 

(ii)	was caused by service-connected bilateral hearing loss and/or tinnitus; or   

(iii)	got worse due to service-connected bilateral hearing loss and/or tinnitus.

In providing the requested opinion, consider the Veteran's description of in-service events and symptoms as well as his post-service symptoms. Do the Veteran's reports about his symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?

A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions, citing to specific evidence of record and medical principles, as necessary. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
