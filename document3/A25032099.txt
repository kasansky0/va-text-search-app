ORDER

The appeal of the deferred adjudication in the November 2023 rating decision for entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is dismissed.

An effective date earlier than August 10, 2022 for the award of service connection for the chronic sinusitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A November 2023 rating decision, of which the Veteran was notified in December 2023, deferred adjudication of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis.

2. In August 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) and, in part, identified the November 2023 rating decision as the rating decision with which he disagreed for the sinusitis claim. 

3. The November 2023 deferred rating decision does not constitute the necessary adjudicative determination from which a NOD may be filed.

4. The Veteran first submitted an August 2023 VA Form 21-526, which related to an August 3, 2023 Intent to File, for the service connection claim for sinusitis.

5. The August 3, 2023 Intent to File was received by VA within one year of the effective date of the PACT Act. 

6. No earlier service connection claims, either formal or informal as applicable, for sinusitis were received prior to the August 3, 2023 Intent to File. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The Board lacks adjudicatory domain to review the deferred adjudication of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis in the November 2023 rating decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104(a), 20.105, 20.201.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022 for the award of service connection for sinusitis are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1988 to October 2008.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Appeals (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 13, 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Preliminary Matters

As an initial matter, after the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran submitted a July 2024 supplemental claim with new and relevant evidence as to the rating assigned for the sinusitis.  In response, the RO increased the rating for the sinusitis to 50 percent effective July 10, 2024, the date that VA received the Supplemental Claim form.  Subsequently in July 2024, the Veteran called VA regarding the supplemental claim and asserted that the "effective date" should go back to his "original date of claim."  In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD) and identified the February 2024 rating decision as the decision with which he disagreed.  In the VA Form 10182, he wrote that his area of disagreement was the "effective date."  

Although there is some indication that the Veteran wants the 50 percent rating to be assigned effective earlier than July 10, 2024, the Veteran neither appealed the initial rating assigned in the February 2024 rating decision on appeal or identify the July 2024 rating decision as a decision with which he disagreed in the August 2024 VA Form 10182.  See July 2024 Report of General Information.  

On the face of the VA Form 10182, he clearly appealed the effective date assigned in the February 2024 rating decision for the grant of service connection for sinusitis.  Conversely, there is no indication on the face of the VA Form 10182 that he intended to appeal the initial rating assigned in the February 2024 rating decision on appeal.  See also September 2024 brief.  Thus, the Board must strictly construe the issue before it as written in the August 2024 VA Form 10182 and confirmed by the Veteran's representative's September 2024 brief.  

Without intimating the success of a future appeal, the Veteran is advised that he may still submit any appropriate review option (to include a VA Form 10182) as to the July 2024 rating decision and assert that the 50 percent rating should be assigned earlier than July 10, 2024 based on continuous pursuit.  However, time is of the essence and the deadline to submit a review option is one year from the date of the July 26, 2024 rating decision notification letter that was mailed to the Veteran.

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

1. The appeal of the deferred adjudication in the November 2023 rating decision for entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is dismissed.

The November 30, 2023 rating decision, of which the Veteran was notified on December 1, 2023, deferred adjudication of the service connection claim for sinusitis.  In the August 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), the Veteran sought to appeal the November 2023 rating decision as to the deferred adjudication for sinusitis and chose the Direct docket.

Notably, the November 2023 rating decision deferred adjudication of the service connection claim for sinusitis, and this deferral does not constitute an adjudicative determination from which an appeal may be filed; thus, the Board does not have adjudicatory domain to review that rating decision for this sinusitis claim and the appeal must be dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104(a), 20.105, 20.201; Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011) (concluding that a deferred rating decision does not constitute an appealable adjudicative action).  

Importantly, the Board notes that the AOJ adjudicated entitlement to service connection for sinusitis in the February 2024 rating decision, for which the Veteran appealed to the Board, which is discussed below.  Therefore, there is no prejudice to the Veteran by the dismissal of this particular issue.

Accordingly, the appeal for entitlement to service connection for sinusitis from the November 2023 rating decision that deferred adjudication is dismissed.

2. An effective date earlier than August 10, 2022 for the award of service connection for the chronic sinusitis is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for sinusitis.  See August 2024 VA Form 10182.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have provided contentions to support this assertion or identified what effective date should be awarded.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act was enacted on August 10, 2022. See PACT Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 § 3373, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).  In part, the PACT Act expanded presumptive service connection for certain disabilities, to include chronic sinusitis, based on exposure to environmental toxins, to include burn pits and other toxic exposures from service in identified areas during the Persian Gulf War.

For a grant of service connection based on the PACT Act, claims filed between August 10, 2022 and August 10, 2023, the effective date may go back to August 10, 2022, but no earlier.  38 C.F.R.§§ 3.114, 3.400, 3.2500. 

Procedurally, on August 3, 2023, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File, and within one year, he submitted a completed August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, requesting service connection for sinusitis.  A February 2024 rating decision granted service connection for sinusitis and assigned a noncompensable rating effective August 10, 2022.  The August 10, 2022 effective date was warranted because the claim was received within one year of the enactment of the PACT Act.

The PACT Act does not allow for an effective date prior to its enactment on August 10, 2022.  Moreover, a review of the record indicates there was no formal or informal claim for compensation submitted prior to August 10, 2022 for which service connection on a direct or secondary theory of entitlement could be based.  The Veteran does not assert otherwise.

As such, an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for sinusitis is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114(a), 3.400.

Finally, the Board notes that neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 69-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
