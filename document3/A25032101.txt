REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1959 to October 1979. He served in the Republic of Vietnam and received the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Palm among other awards and decorations. He died in April 2021, and the Appellant is his surviving spouse.

The appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that, in pertinent part, denied entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death. In June 2023, the Appellant submitted VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held before a Veterans Law Judge other than the undersigned in September 2023; a transcript is associated with the record.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

In a January 2024 decision, the Board denied service connection for cause of the Veteran's death. The Appellant subsequently appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In October 2024, the Court issued an order granting the parties' Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) to vacate the January 2024 Board Decision and remanded the case back to the Board for compliance with the JMR.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. Because the Board is remanding the claim seeking entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.

The Board sincerely regrets additional delay, but based on the parties' October 2024 JMR and a reevaluation of the evidence, the Board finds a remand is required to obtain outstanding non-VA treatment records.

In the October 2024 JMR, the parties agreed VA failed to satisfy its duty to assist by not obtaining the records from Baylor Scott and White Hospital - Round Rock because the Veteran's death certificate shows he passed away there while receiving inpatient treatment there.

On remand, such records should be obtained and associated with the record. To expedite this action, the Appellant is encouraged to submit any relevant treatment records in her possession.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

After obtaining all needed authorizations, obtain the Veteran's outstanding the records from Baylor Scott and White Hospital - Round Rock. At least two attempts should made for any identified records if necessary. All records requests must be documented in the claims file. If the AOJ determines that the requested records cannot be obtained, they must note this in the record. 

To expedite this action, the Appellant is encouraged to submit any relevant treatment records in her possession.
