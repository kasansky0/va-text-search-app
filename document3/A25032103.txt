CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. For the period prior to April 11, 2023, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar strain with spasm, degenerative disc disease, intervertebral disc syndrome, disc herniation and L-5, S-1 microdiscectomy have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

2. For the period prior to April 11, 2023, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

3. For the period prior to April 11, 2023, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2010 to January 2016.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decisions in April 2023 and February 2024 of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In response to these decisions, the Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) in February 2024. The Veteran requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Accordingly, the Board will consider the evidence consider the evidence received prior to the rating decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

1. Prior to April 11, 2023, entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar strain with spasm, degenerative disc disease, intervertebral disc syndrome, disc herniation and L-5, S-1 microdiscectomy

2. Prior to April 11, 2023, entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (sciatic nerve)

3. Prior to April 11, 2023, entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve)

The Veteran contends that higher ratings are warranted for his lumbar spine disability and associated radiculopathy throughout the period on appeal. For the period on appeal prior to April 11, 2023, these claims were denied by the above-referenced April 11, 2023, rating decision. 

The Veteran's claims were denied after the Veteran failed to attend scheduled examinations in February 2023. The claims file does not indicate that the Veteran has provided good cause for failing to attend these examinations or requested that they be rescheduled. 

VA regulation 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 provides that when a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with a compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. When the examination was scheduled in conjunction with any other original claim, a reopened claim for a benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim for increase, the claim shall be denied. Upon finding that a claimant has not demonstrated good cause for failing to report for a VA exam scheduled in conjunction with a reopened claim or a claim for increase, the VA must deny the claim in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.655. See Kyhn v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 228 (2010).

Unfortunately, with regard to the April 2023 determinations, the Veteran filed several claims for increase and VA scheduled the Veteran for VA examinations to ascertain the severity of his service-connected connected conditions in February 2023. The Veteran failed to report for these examinations without explanation and the Veteran has not reported good cause for his failure to report for the scheduled examinations in connection with his claims for increase. VA's duty to assist is not always a one-way street. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). The Veteran must cooperate in VA's efforts to obtain evidence needed to adjudicate his claims, including keeping his contact information up to date, attending scheduled VA examinations, and promptly communicating with VA why he cannot attend scheduled VA examinations.

The Veteran has failed to report, without good cause, for his scheduled VA examinations in conjunction with his claims for increased ratings for the period prior to April 11, 2023. Therefore, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (b), the increased rating claims related to the April 2023 rating decision must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.655.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. From April 11, 2023, entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar strain with spasm, degenerative disc disease, intervertebral disc syndrome, disc herniation and L-5, S-1 microdiscectomy is remanded.

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

For the period on appeal from April 11, 2023, the evidence indicates that the Veteran's condition may have significantly changed between the Veteran's December 2023 spine examination and the February 2024 rating decision on appeal. In January 2024, the Veteran submitted private treatment records indicating that he was expected to undergo a "re-do right L5-S1 microdiscectomy" on January 17, 2024. Since surgery to the Veteran's lumbar spine could significantly impact the severity of his condition, the Board finds that the duty to assist required that an additional VA examination be afforded to determine the severity of the Veteran's condition after the January 2024 surgery. As this evidence was associated with the claims file prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Board finds that it was a pre-decisional duty to assist error to not provide an updated examination regarding the severity of his lumbar spine condition. 

2. From April 11, 2023, entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) is remanded.

3. From April 11, 2023, entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) is remanded.

4. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for lumbar scar status post microdiscectomy is remanded.

Since the additional development regarding the Veteran's claim for a higher rating for his service-connected lumbar spine condition could significantly impact a decision on his claims for a higher rating for his right and left lower extremity radiculopathy and the rating assigned for his microdiscectomy scar, these issues are inextricably intertwined and must also be remanded.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of his service-connected lumbar spine condition and associated radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities.

The examiner must review the claims file in conjunction with the examination. All pertinent symptomatology and findings should be reported in detail.
