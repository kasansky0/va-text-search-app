REMANDED

Whether the withholding of VA disability compensation due to concurrent receipt of VA compensation and pension and 63 days of military drill pay for fiscal year 2023 was proper, the appeal is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 2011 until his honorable discharge in November 2021.  See November 2021 DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty).  Subsequently, the Veteran has served in the United States Navy Reserve and has period(s) of inactive duty for training and/or active duty for training.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  See June 2023 Notification Letter.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  See June 2024 VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), Part II.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Whether the withholding of VA disability compensation due to concurrent receipt of VA compensation and pension and 63 days of military drill pay for fiscal year 2023 was proper, the appeal is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that the withholding of 63 days of military drill pay for fiscal year 2023 was not proper.

The Board notes that in May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8951-2 (Notice of Waiver of VA Compensation or Pension to Receive Military Pay and Allowances).  Within the Veteran's May 2023 VA Form 21-8951-2 (Notice of Waiver of VA Compensation or Pension to Receive Military Pay and Allowances), the Veteran reported that for fiscal year 2023 (October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023), the Veteran had 63 training days.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-8951-2 (Notice of Waiver of VA Compensation or Pension to Receive Military Pay and Allowances)), Section II and Section III.  Furthermore, the Board notes that the May 2023 VA Form 21-8951-2 (Notice of Waiver of VA Compensation or Pension to Receive Military Pay and Allowances) was signed by the Veteran and his Unit Commander or Designee (a Lt. Commander).  However, the Board notes that the reported number of training days "received" (past tense) for Fiscal Year 2023, and the fiscal year was not yet complete and the information is inconsistent with the VA/Department of Defense Identity Repository (VADIR) report addressed below.

Furthermore, in June 2023, the AOJ received a report from the VADIR.  The VADIR database is an electronic repository of military personnel's military history, payroll information and their dependents' data provided to VA by the Department of Defense's Manpower Data Center (DMDC) using the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).  The Department of Defense is the owner of all data within VADIR.  The name, birthdate, and social security number match the name, birthdate, and social security number.  The June 2023 VADIR report reflects that for fiscal year 2023, the Veteran had 8 drill days in the United States Navy Reserve.  However, once again, the fiscal year was not yet complete and the information is inconsistent with the above record(s) submitted by the Veteran.

Due to the inconsistencies of the above information, the Board finds that a remand is warranted to obtain accurate information.  The Veteran may wish to submit a corrected VA Form 21-8951-2 (Notice of Waiver of VA Compensation or Pension to Receive Military Pay and Allowances), with a narrative from his Unit Commander explaining the basis of any discrepancies prior to any subsequent decision(s) by the AOJ (a limited period of time that new evidence may be considered).  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the Veteran's complete service personnel records, to include all documents pertaining to service in the United States Navy Reserve.  Verify all active duty for training and inactive duty training dates for service in the United States Navy Reserve for fiscal year 2023 (October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023).

2. A request should be made to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) to verify any and all pay that the Veteran received during fiscal year 2023.

3. Document all requests for information as well as all responses in the claims file.
