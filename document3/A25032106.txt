ORDER

Service connection for migraine headaches is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record is at least approximately balanced regarding whether the Veteran's migraine headaches were caused by his service-connected tinnitus. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for migraine headaches as secondary to service-connected tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 1154(a), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310, 3.317.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Unites States Navy from March 1991 to March 1995, including service in the Persian Gulf. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket and challenged the agency of original jurisdiction's March 2024 rating decision.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the notice of the July 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review (HLR) in a March 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the notice of the July 2022 agency of original jurisdiction decision that was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for a disability which is aggravated by, proximately due to, or the result of a service-connected disease or injury under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310, Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

In order to establish service connection on a secondary basis, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical evidence establishing a link between the service-connected disability and the current disability.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

Additionally, where a Veteran is seeking service connection, due consideration shall be given to the places, types, and circumstances of such Veteran's service as shown by such Veteran's service record, the official history of each organization in which such Veteran served, such Veteran's medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). 

When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board").

The Board is charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence.  Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).  Indeed, in Jefferson v. Principi, 271 F.3d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), citing its decision in Madden, recognized that that Board had inherent fact-finding ability.  Id. at 1076; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) (West 2002).  Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to weigh and assess the evidence.  Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992).  

As a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is satisfactory, the Board may also properly consider internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the Veteran, and the Veteran's demeanor when testifying at a hearing.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  

Determinations as to service connection will be based on review of the entire evidence of record, to include all pertinent medical and lay evidence, with due consideration to VA's policy to administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with the facts in each individual case.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant.

To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

The Veteran contends his tinnitus causes his migraine headaches.  

In support, the Veteran cites medical literature that discusses the relationship between tinnitus and headaches, and a migraine headache log of dates of occurrences.  See January 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ; See May 2022 Correspondence. 

The Board notes the favorable findings in the July 2022 rating decision on appeal include a diagnosis of migraine headaches and acknowledgement that the claimed primary disability (tinnitus) is service connected.  

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of migraine headaches.  See June 2022 VA Examination.  

Further, for the tinnitus, the Board notes that service connection is in effect for the Veteran's tinnitus.  

In light of the foregoing, the first two requirements for secondary service connection are met.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).  All that remains to be resolved is whether the medical evidence of record establishes a link between the Veteran's service-connected disability and his migraines. 

The Veteran was provided with a February 2022 VA examination regarding his hearing loss and tinnitus.  Critically, the examiner opined the Veteran's tinnitus interrupts his sleep and concentration and aggravates his migraine headaches.  See February 2022 VA Examination. 

The Board acknowledges the negative nexus opinion from July 2022 stating that that the Veteran's migraine headaches condition is less likely as not related to tinnitus.  The examiner opined that migraine headaches and tinnitus are separate and distinct medical conditions. 

The Veteran contends that his migraine headaches are triggered and worsened by his service-connected tinnitus.  

The Veteran further asserted that the July 2022 VA opinion was inadequate and that his migraines occur following episodes of tinnitus.  See February 2023 Correspondence. 

The Veteran's representative, American Legion, submitted an Informal Hearing Presentation (IHP) regarding service connection for migraines.  In the IHP the Veteran's representative, The American Legion, maintained he Veteran's migraines were caused by his tinnitus.  See August 2024 IHP. 

In this case, the Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The evaluation of evidence generally involves a 3-step inquiry.  First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source.  The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (Observing that once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible).  The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the proffered evidence in light of the entirety of the record.

The Board also notes that under certain circumstances, lay evidence may be sufficient to establish a nexus.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  Lay evidence has been found to be competent with regard to a disease that has "unique and readily identifiable features" that are "capable of lay observation."  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308-09 (2007); see also Petitti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415, 427-28 (2015) (where the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims found objective evidence of pain need not come from a medical professional; a lay person may provide the requisite confirmation).

The Board has considered the evidence of record.  The Board notes that the VA examiners of record are medical professionals competent to opine as to the etiology of the Veteran's claimed disorder.  

The Board also recognizes that the Veteran is competent to report the onset and increase in severity of his headaches when he suffers from the manifestations of his tinnitus.  In addition, the Board finds the Veteran's account credible as this is capable of lay observation.

Given the evidence discussed above, the Board finds that the evidence of record is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's migraine headaches was proximately due to, or aggravated by, his service-connected tinnitus disability.  The reasonable doubt created by this approximate balance must be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  As such, the third prong of secondary service connection is met.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's migraine headaches is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310. 

Because the Board is grating service connection on the basis that his migraine headaches were caused by his service-connected tinnitus, the Board need not discuss whether service connection is warranted on another basis for the Veteran's migraine headaches.
