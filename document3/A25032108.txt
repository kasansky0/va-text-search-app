REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 2001 to June 2001, from December 2001 to April 2003, from July 2003 to December 2003, from February 2004 to July 2004, from September 2004 to November 2005, from January 2006 to May 2006, from August 2006 to April 2007, and from December 2010 to September 2011. The Veteran is a Persian Gulf War Veteran with service in Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision issued by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Failure to Report -VA Examinations

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a), when entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination, and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination or reexamination, action shall be taken in accordance with either 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b) or (c), as appropriate. When a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

The initial filing of the proper form seeking one or more benefits received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is defined as an original claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(1); 3.160(b). In December 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation, seeking service connection for, among other things, bilateral ankle and knee conditions, low back pain, neck pain, and a left shoulder condition. In January 2023, the Veteran filed another VA Form 526EZ seeking service connection for PTSD. As there are no prior claims for these disabilities, and the claims were filed on the proper form, the Board finds that these claims represent the original compensation claims.

The Veteran was scheduled for VA examinations for all claimed disabilities, except for PTSD, in March 2023. See March 2023 Exam Scheduling Request. On May 5, 2023, the Veteran was notified of the date, time, and location of his scheduled examinations. See May 2023 Appointment Notification Letter. On May 10, 2023, the Veteran was notified that his initial VA examinations had been rescheduled. See May 2023 Notification of Rescheduled Appointment. Documentation from June 2023 indicates that the Veteran did not show for examinations associated with his claimed bilateral knee, bilateral ankle, neck, low back, and left shoulder conditions.

In October 2023, the Veteran was scheduled for VA examinations for his claimed PTSD, and back, neck, and left shoulder conditions. See October 2023 Exam Scheduling request; see also, October 2023 Subsequent Development Letter.  Additionally, the AOJ contacted the Veteran telephonically to inquire why he missed his previously scheduled appointments. See October 2023 Report of General Information. No contact with the Veteran was made; however, a message was left that provided the 800 telephone number. Id. In the event the Veteran called, instructions were provided to inform the Veteran that examinations were being ordered for previously missed exams and that a letter would also be sent regarding examination request details. Id. Documentation from November 2023 indicates that the Veteran did not report for his PTSD, neck, back, or left shoulder examinations.

To date, the Veteran has offered no argument regarding good cause for his failure to appear at the scheduled examinations and there is no indication that he attempted to reschedule the examinations. Additionally, there is no evidence in the record that mail was not received by the Veteran, nor has the Veteran averred such. Moreover, the VA did not received mail addressed to the Veteran that had been returned as undeliverable.

The Board finds that the Veteran filed original claims in December 2022 and January 2023, received proper notice of scheduled examinations, and failed to appear for the scheduled examinations without presenting good cause for doing so. Thus, under these circumstances, the Veteran's claims will be evaluated based on the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in, or aggravated by, active military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Determinations as to service connection will be based on review of the entire evidence of record, to include all pertinent medical and lay evidence, with due consideration to VA's policy to administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with the facts in each individual case. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

In adjudicating these claims, the Board must assess the competence and credibility of the Veteran. Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005). Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology and "may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection." Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 405 (1995).

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition; (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis; or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case by case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).

The Board is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for left ankle condition

2. Entitlement to service connection for right ankle condition

3. Entitlement to service connection for left knee condition (claimed as knee pain)

4. Entitlement to service connection for right knee condition (claimed as knee pain)

5. Entitlement to service connection for low back condition

6. Entitlement to service connection for neck pain

7. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD

The Veteran contends that the aforementioned claimed disabilities were incurred in or are otherwise related to his active military service.

The Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD or a current bilateral ankle, bilateral knee, low back, or neck disability. No medical professional has diagnosed the Veteran with these disabilities during the appeal period. As noted above, the Veteran failed to report for his VA examinations and, as such, evidence which may have been supportive of granting service connection, by showing a current disability for the claimed conditions, was not obtained. See Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 178 (2005) (the claimant is obligated to cooperate in the development of evidence, and failure to do so puts him at risk of an adverse adjudication based on an incomplete and underdeveloped record).

Additionally, there is insufficient medical or lay evidence of record that suggests that the Veteran has a bilateral ankle, bilateral knee, low back, or neck condition, including any symptoms, such as pain, that results in functional impairment. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding that pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability). For a disability to be service connected, it must be present at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during or contemporary to the pendency of the appeal. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).

Although a lack of contemporaneous medical evidence does not automatically constitute substantive negative evidence, the Board may weigh the absence of contemporaneous records when assessing the credibility and weight to be given lay evidence. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011). Competent lay evidence can, in some circumstances, be sufficient to establish the presence of a current disability. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Here, the Veteran has not provided any statements describing his symptomatology or the functional impairment, if any, associated with his claimed PTSD, bilateral ankle, bilateral knee, low back, and neck conditions. Thus, without more, the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ alone does not provide enough evidence for the Board to find he has a current disability. Therefore, the Board assigns minimal probative value to the Veteran's lay statements as they are not supported by the competent and credible evidence of record.

In the absence of a diagnosis or functional loss or impairment, the Veteran does not meet the cornerstone element of service connection, a current disability. Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). As such, an assessment of the remaining elements of service connection is not necessary.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) contain complaints, treatment, and diagnoses of back and neck pain; however, these records are from 2018, and the medical and lay evidence of record does not show, or suggest, that the Veteran has experienced a continuity of back or neck pain in the years since. Additionally, the Veteran failed to report for his VA examinations, which may have provided pertinent information regarding a nexus for his claimed back and neck disabilities. See Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 178 (2005). The Veteran's lack of cooperation here means that evidence which may have been supportive of granting service connection, by showing a nexus for a back and neck disability, was not obtained.

The Board further acknowledges that the Veteran has received mental health treatment between 2019 and 2020; however, the nature and severity of this treatment is unknown. The Veteran identified Dr. B.B. as his treating psychiatrist and authorized release of his medical records to the VA. See January 2023 VA Form 21-4142, Authorization to Disclose Information to the Department of Veterans Affairs; January 2023 VA Form 21-4142a, General Release for Medical Provider Information. The AOJ requested the Veteran's medical records from Dr. B.B; however, the authorizations were rejected due to invalid PHP information. See February 2023 Report of General Information; January 2023 Notification Letter. In response, on two occasions, the AOJ attempted to contact Dr. B.B.'s office to remedy the situation. Id. The record does not contain any response from Dr. B.B. In August 2023, the Veteran was notified that Dr. B.B. had rejected the prior medical authorizations and the reasons therefor. See August 2023 Subsequent Development Letter. The AOJ requested that the Veteran execute new VA Forms 21-4142 and 21-4142a and attached blank copies to the notification letter. Id. The Veteran was also informed that he himself could obtain and submit the records. Id. The Veteran did not submit any records from Dr. B.B., and did not complete new medical authorizations. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the VA's duty to assist has been satisfied with respect to the Veteran's private mental health records from Dr. B.B. The Board emphasizes that the duty to assist is not a one-way street, and in this case, the Veteran failed to cooperate to the full extent in the development of his claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655; Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 406 (1991).

In conclusion, the Board finds that the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claims for service connection for PTSD, a bilateral ankle condition, a bilateral knee condition, a low back condition, and neck pain. As the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs against service connection, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and service connection is not warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, the claims are denied.

8. Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder condition

The Veteran contends that his claimed left shoulder condition was incurred in or is otherwise related to his active military service.

The AOJ found that the Veteran had a current diagnosis of status post (s/p) left shoulder scope Bankart repair. This is a favorable finding by the AOJ and the Board is bound by this favorable finding, absent clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Accordingly, the Board finds that the first element of service connection has been met.

The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's current diagnosis of s/p left shoulder scope Bankart repair was caused when he fell while on vacation and dislocated his left shoulder. See July 2020 Orthopaedic Institute of Ohio (OIO) Treatment Note. Based upon this complaint, and subsequent diagnostic imaging, it was determined that arthroscopic surgery with arthroscopy Bankart repair and superior labral debridement of a SLAP tear was required. See September 2020 OIO Treatment Note. The Veteran underwent arthroscopic surgery in September 2020. Id.

The Board notes that the Veteran's STRs show complaints, treatment, and a diagnosis of left shoulder pain in 2018. Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from injury or disease incurred or aggravated during a period of active duty for training (ADT) or from an injury incurred or aggravated during a period of inactive duty (IDT). 38 U.S.C. § 101(24), 106, 1110, 1131. The Veteran's claims file does not contain specific information about his periods of ADT and IDT. However, given the record before it, the Board need not make, and does not make, a determination regarding whether the Veteran's complaints of left shoulder pain in 2018 occurred during a period of ADT or IDT.

There is no nexus opinion associated with the claims file and the record lacks any probative evidence connecting the current left shoulder disability to his active service. There is no documentation in any of his medical records supporting such a relationship and the Veteran has not provided a medical opinion or any other evidence for this connection. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statement that he was told by his physician that, during surgery, an old tear was found that lent to the current dislocation and additional tear. The Veteran is competent to report on matters of which he has firsthand knowledge, such as being told that an old tear was found during surgery. However, the Veteran is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding whether the old tear was incurred in or is otherwise related to his active military service. Accordingly, the Board finds this statement insufficient to show a connection between the Veteran's current left shoulder disability and his active service and affords it minimal probative value.

As noted above, the Veteran failed to report for his left shoulder VA examination, which may have provided pertinent information regarding a nexus for his left shoulder condition. See Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 178 (2005). The Veteran's lack of cooperation here means that evidence which may have been supportive of granting service connection, by showing a nexus for a left shoulder disability, was not obtained.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for service connection for a left shoulder condition. As the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs against service connection, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and service connection is not warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, the claim is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
