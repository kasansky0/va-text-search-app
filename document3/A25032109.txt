REMANDED

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on February 9, 2021, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The appellant, Aegis Sciences Corporation, is a non-VA healthcare provider who rendered services to the Veteran on February 9, 2021.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 1703(c), (h).   

In the June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The AOJ denied payment for medical services of diagnostic COVID-19 testing furnished by?the appellant?on February 9, 2021, pursuant to?38 U.S.C. § 1703, on the basis that such services had not been authorized by VA as was required for payment.  

The Board finds that a remand is warranted to satisfy a statutory duty under 38 U.S.C. § 5104. 38C.F.R. §20.802(a) (the Board may remand for correction of any error by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim).

In general, non-VA care and medical services that will be paid for by VA through the Veterans Community Care Program must be authorized in advance.  See?38 C.F.R. § 17.4020.  In the absence of such VA authorization, in order to be entitled to payment or reimbursement of medical expenses incurred at a non-VA facility, certain conditions including that the treatment was for a medical emergency must be met.  See?38 U.S.C. §§ 1725, 1728. 

Here, the record reflects that the COVID-19 test was provided by the appellant on February 9, 2021.  The record also contains a report of hospitalization, indicating that the Veteran was admitted to Silver Ridge Health Care Center from February 8, 2021 to March 4, 2021. Notably however, there is no indication as to whether this was an authorized stay or whether this was an emergency hospitalization. It is unclear whether this evidence was available and reviewed by the AOJ in connection with this claim. Due process also requires that the AOJ ensures that the record before it is made available for the Board's review in connection with the appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (requiring the Secretary to consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case).

Therefore, remand is warranted for the VHA to associate with the electronic claims file all relevant records before it at the time it denied the Veteran's claim, including but not limited to the decisions on appeal and all relevant medical records.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Associate all evidence associated with the claim for payment of the cost of medical services of diagnostic COVID-19 testing incurred by the appellant on February 9, 2021. 

The record should include (but is not limited to): the claim for payment and/or records of payment by a third party; any evidence submitted by the Veteran in connection with the claim; VA healthcare enrollment records, records relating to any service-connected conditions and any relevant VA and private medical records obtained or received in connection with the claim; and any other relevant documents received or generated in connection with the claim. 

If any such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the appellant with notice of the unavailability of records.
