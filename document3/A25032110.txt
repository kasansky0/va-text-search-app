ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for panic disorder with secondary insomnia is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's complained of symptoms have been clinically attributed to panic disorder with secondary insomnia which in turn has been clinically linked to an event in his military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for panic disorder with secondary insomnia have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1976 to August 1979. 

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2023 rating decision. In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2023 decision.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023  AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999). Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

The Veteran contends that he has an acquired psychiatric disorder due to an incident in service. He claims that during a field exercise, while he was stationed in Germany in the winter of 1977, he suffered carbon monoxide poisoning while sleeping in a vehicle and almost died. See June 2007 VA Form 21-0781. He provided several statements from fellow servicemembers corroborating this incident. Additionally, he provided an October 2006 private psychiatric treatment record that noted the Veteran's report of "a near death experience" in service due to carbon monoxide poisoning and mentioned that panic attacks and anxiety started five years after this incident. The physician diagnosed panic disorder under Axis I and listed "near death experience" under Axis IV. 

VA treatment records, including dated in February 2015, March 2015, April 2015, August 2015, March 2023, and June 2023, show diagnosis and treatment for a panic disorder with secondary insomnia. The Veteran reported on the "near death experience due to carbon monoxide poisoning when [he] was in Germany." He experienced frequent panic attacks for about 10 years without disclosing his symptoms to anyone because he was concerned that he was "going crazy." He finally sought medical treatment for panic symptoms when he believed that he was having a cardiac problem. He has been prescribed alprazolam. He began experiencing difficulty falling and staying asleep about 10 years ago. He attributed initial sleep disturbance to his history of nocturnal panic attacks, and pattern of "sitting up all night thinking [he is] going to have a panic attack." He is prescribed zolpidem.

The Veteran was not afforded a VA examination for his claimed disability.

As there is medical evidence diagnosing a psychiatric condition, credible lay evidence of an in-service event, and a link, established by medical evidence, between the psychiatric condition and the in-service event, service connection for panic disorder with secondary insomnia is warranted.
