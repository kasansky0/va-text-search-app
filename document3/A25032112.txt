ORDER

Entitlement to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill), to include an extension of the delimiting date beyond April 24, 2017, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was last separated from active-duty service on April 23, 2002, after more than 90 days of continuous active-duty services; her period of eligibility for Chapter 33 education benefits expired on April 24, 2017. 

2. Statutory and regulatory authority permit extensions of the 15-year delimiting date for Chapter 33 benefits only in limited circumstances, none of which are applicable here.

3. The Veteran applied for Chapter 30/Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits and, in October 2011, was informed she was entitled to 36 months of benefits that must be used before April 24, 2012. The record does not indicate that these benefits were used. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill), to include an extension of the delimiting date beyond April 24, 2017, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3031, 3311, 3321; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.9520, 21.9530, 21.9535.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 1989 to April 2002.

In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April and July 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to VA educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill), to include an extension of the delimiting date beyond April 24, 2017, is denied.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to Chapter 33 benefits and argues for an extension of her delimiting date beyond April 24, 2017. She contends that she paid into her educational benefits, served for 13 years, and had been unable to use her educational benefits over the years due to hardship associated with caring for her brother and mother. See December 20, 2022 Correspondence.

An individual is eligible for Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) educational assistance if, among other things, commencing on or after September 11, 2001, he or she serves an aggregate of at least 90 days on active duty in the Armed Forces (excluding entry level and skill training), and continues on active duty or is discharged with an honorable discharge. 38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520.

In this regard, the Veteran's basic eligibility for Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits is not in dispute. Rather, the dispute concerns whether she applied for benefits prior to her delimiting date. The Board finds she did not.

Generally, in the case of a veteran whose last discharge or release from active duty was before January 1, 2013, his or her period of eligibility for Post 9/11 GI Bill educational assistance will terminate effective 15 years from the date of the last discharge or release from active duty of at least 90 continuous days (or 30 continuous days if the veteran is released for a service-connected disability). 38 U.S.C. § 3321; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9530.

The Veteran was released from active duty in April 2002. Thus, she was entitled to Chapter 33 benefits for 15 years after her separation from active-duty service, or until April 2017. Accordingly, April 24, 2017 is her delimiting date under Chapter 33.

The April 2022 AOJ decision on appeal denied the Veteran's claim for Chapter 33 educational benefits because her eligibility period had already ended in April 2017. Thereafter, the Veteran requested an extension of her delimiting date. She argued she paid into the Montgomery GI Bill/Chapter 30 benefits but was later informed the Post-9/11 GI Bill/Chapter 33 benefits were longer than 15 years and better benefits, so she applied for Chapter 33 benefits in April 2022. She felt that her honorable service for 13 years should warrant her ability to use the Chapter 33 benefits. She wrote that she was "healed and ready to use" her GI Bill when two of her family members developed serious health problems. See December 2022 Correspondence.

Notably, VA will extend a veteran's period of eligibility if medical evidence clearly establishes that the veteran was prevented from initiating or completing his/her program of education because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from his/her own willful misconduct, and if the veteran applies for the extension within a specified time limit. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9535 (a). VA will also grant an extension if the veteran was captured and forcibly detained by a foreign government or power and was hospitalized at a military, civilian or medical facility immediately thereafter. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9535 (b). Similarly, the date that the period of eligibility begins to run may be delayed if the veteran's nature of discharge that previously disentitled him/her from benefits had changed or if the veteran was prevented from pursuing a program of education because he/she was acting as the primary provider of personal care services for a veteran. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3031 (b), (d), 3321(b).

The Veteran initially applied for Chapter 30 benefits in September 2011 and received her letter of entitlement for Chapter 30 benefits in October 2011. However, she stated she was unable to use the Chapter 30 benefits because her brother suffered a pulmonary embolism and required medication from 2010 to 2011, her mother was suffering from arthritis, and she began to care for both. The family struggled financially and moved to another state. It appears that this was the reason she did not pursue the degree listed in the initial Chapter 30 education benefits application. She described her mother's health further declined, and she ended up caring for both her brother and mother until their passing in 2020 and 2022, respectively. See November 2023 Education file (containing a June 2022 letter), 32-34. She requested VA provide her an extension to use her benefits due to her need to be a caregiver for her relatives.

Although the period of eligibility for Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits may be extended under certain circumstances, no such exception is applicable in this case. There is no evidence in this case that the Veteran's own mental or physical disability prevented her from initiating or completing her program of education. Furthermore, the Veteran has not claimed that any disabilities prevented her from utilizing her education benefits. Rather, the Veteran asserts hardship related to caring for family members beginning in 2010 as a reason for not initiating or completing her program of education. In June 2022, VA sent a letter to the Veteran which listed the "only" three reasons an extension can be provided and requested that the Veteran provide evidence related to any disability she may be claiming prevented her prior use of Chapter 33 benefits. A July 2022 letter to the Veteran denied her request for an extension because she did not respond to the June 2022 letter. The Veteran stated that she did not receive the July 2022 letter until November 2022. She did not argue she did not receive the June 2022 letter requesting evidence of a disability limiting her from applying for benefits prior to her delimiting date. After notification of the July 2022 letter in November 2022, the Veteran submitted additional argument regarding her request for an extension. It reiterates her appeal that she was a caregiver for her brother and mother for more than a decade, and so was unable to use her educational benefits. 

As noted above, VA is limited in providing extensions for delimiting dates for Chapter 33 benefits. The Veteran has not expressed that she was prevented from initiating or completing her education due to her own physical or mental disability, and after receiving notice of the options for an extension, she did not submit evidence related to one of the exception reasons. The record does not show, and the Veteran does not assert, that she was detained by a foreign government or power after her release from active duty, 38 C.F.R. § 21.9535 (b), or that the nature of her discharge previously disentitled her from benefits, 38 U.S.C. §§ 3031 (b), 3321(b). The record also does not show, and the Veteran does not assert, that she was acting as the primary care provider of personal care services for a veteran. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3031 (d), 3321(b). Although the Veteran reported she was caring for her brother and mother, she did not indicate that either relative was a veteran. 

Accordingly, because none of the limited circumstances allowing for an extension of the 15-year delimiting date are applicable here, the Board is unable to grant the benefits sought in this case. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3031 (b)-(d), 3321; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.9530, 21.9535.

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's position and commends the Veteran on her desire for educational pursuits; however, the applicable law and regulations are clear that except in specific circumstances which are not met here, the Veteran's period of eligibility for use of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits expired on April 24, 2017. As the law and not the evidence is dispositive in this case, the claim must be denied as a matter of law. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

Chapter 30/Montgomery GI Bill and Forever GI Bill

The Board notes that the Veteran has appealed the denial of her request to use Chapter 33/Post-9/11 GI benefits. However, the Veteran has also discussed her Chapter 30/Montgomery GI Bill payments and the Forever GI Bill in her arguments.

As noted above, the Veteran applied to use her Chapter 30 educational benefits in September 2011. In October 2011, VA provided the Veteran with a Certificate of Eligibility, informing her that she had 36 months of education benefits that could be used before April 24, 2012, the date her Chapter 30 benefits would end. The education file contained in the electronic record does not show that any of these education benefits were used. In her arguments, the Veteran has noted that she paid the $1,200.00 towards her Chapter 30 education benefits while she was in service. The Board notes that she may be eligible for a refund of her Chapter 30 contributions pursuant to 38 CFR 21.9645. More information on that can be found here: https://www.va.gov/resources/montgomery-gi-bill-refunds/

The Veteran has also stated that she applied for her Chapter 33 benefits in April 2022 after seeing a commercial related to the Forever GI Bill. The Board recognizes that the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-48, § 112 (enacted Aug. 16, 2017), also known as the Forever GI Bill, eliminated the 15-year delimiting date for Chapter 33 benefits for those veterans who were discharged from service on or after January 1, 2013. See 38 U.S.C. § 3321 (a)(2). Unfortunately, as the Veteran was last discharged from service in 2002, she is not eligible for the Forever GI Bill. Thus, this provision is not applicable in this case.
