DOCKET NO. 230414-340418
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal based on the VA form 10182 received on April 14, 2023 is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

There is no rating decision for which the April 14, 2023 VA Form 10182 can serve as an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal based on the VA Form 10182 received on April 14, 2023 are met.  38 U.S.C. §§7105, 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.   

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

On April 14, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182.  It was not a valid filing.  Accordingly, the appeal based on that April 2023 VA Form 10182 is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).   In the April 14, 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated that he was appealing a December 23, 2022, decision regarding temporary increase in compensation.   However, there is no decision dated as such.

On September 19, 2022, the Veteran filed a claim for a temporary total disability rating for left knee disability due to surgery.  That claim was never adjudicated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  Instead, the Veteran received a letter on December 23, 2022 alerting him to file an appeal on the proper form.  The Board notes that there have been two attempts on December 27, 2022, and January 24, 2023, to reopen the claim.  However, the claim was never adjudicated.  Nonetheless, the Veteran filed an April 14, 2023 10182 in response to the December 23, 2022, letter.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sent the Veteran a letter on January 17, 2025, informing him that his appeal did not meet the necessary procedural requirements and affording him 60 days from the date of the letter to respond with a written statement explaining why he believes his April 14, 2023 VA Form 10182 is a valid appeal.  The Veteran did not respond.  Accordingly, there is no case or controversy to be adjudicated, and the Board lacks jurisdiction to review the matter at this time.  As such, the appeal is dismissed as a matter of law.
