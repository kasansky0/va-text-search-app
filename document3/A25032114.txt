ORDER

The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of service connection for iron deficiency anemia is denied. 

The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of a 30 percent rating for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is denied.

The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of a 50 percent rating for sinusitis is denied.

The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's last claim for service connection for iron deficiency anemia was denied in a March 2018 rating decision.  She filed a notice of disagreement and a statement of the case was issued in February 2020.  She did not appeal that decision and that appeal stream is now closed.  There are no unadjudicated claims for service connection for iron deficiency anemia since the February 2020 statement of the case up until the August 1, 2023, intent to file.  The Veteran's iron deficiency anemia was not granted service connection as a result of a liberalizing law, but as secondary to another service-connected disability.  

2. The record on review does not show that it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran's IBS increased in severity in the year preceding receipt of the August 1, 2023, intent to file.

3. The record on review does not show that it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran's sinusitis increased in severity in the year preceding receipt of the August 1, 2023, intent to file.

4. The Veteran's eligibility for DEA benefits is based upon her 100 percent combined rating, which is effective from August 1, 2023.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of service connection for iron deficiency anemia have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160, 3.303, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of 30 percent for IBS have not been met.  38?U.S.C. §§?1155, 5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.400, 4.1, 4.126, 4.114, DC 7319.

3. The criteria for an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of 50 percent for sinusitis have not been met.  38?U.S.C. §§?1155, 5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.400, 4.1, 4.126, 4.97, DC 6512.

4. The criteria for an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA benefits have not been met.  38?U.S.C. §§?3500, 3501, 5110; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.400, 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1992 to September 2012.

This appeal is from a January 2024 rating decision and a May 2024 HLR (higher level review) rating decision.  The Veteran filed a timely appeal, asking for placement on the direct review docket.

The January 2024 rating decision awarded increased ratings for IBS and sinusitis, and granted eligibility to DEA benefits.  The notification date for this decision is January 4, 2024.  The record closed with respect to DEA benefits on January 4, 2024, and the Board's consideration of the evidence is restricted to that which was of record at that time.

The May 2024 HLR rating decision reviewed the effective dates of the 30 percent rating assigned to IBS and the 50 percent rating assigned to sinusitis in the rating decision issued January 4, 2024.  It also reviewed the effective date of the grant of service connection for iron deficiency anemia assigned in a separate January 2024 rating decision, which had a notification date of January 18, 2024.  Under the provisions governing higher level review, the record closed for those claims on the date of notification of the decisions on review.  Thus, with respect to the IBS and sinusitis appeals, the record closed January 4, 2024, and the Board's consideration of the evidence for these claims is restricted to that which was of record on January 4, 2024.  With respect to anemia, the record closed January 18, 2024, and the Board's consideration of the evidence is restricted to that which was of record on January 18, 2024.    

Effective Dates

1. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of service connection for iron deficiency anemia is denied.

The Veteran has appealed for an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for iron deficiency anemia.  She asserts that it is a presumptive disability and that it was granted pursuant to the PACT Act.  She argues that she filed her claim within a year of the enactment of the PACT Act, and that the effective date should go back to August 10, 2022, the effective date of the PACT Act.  

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of service connection, shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38?U.S.C. §?5110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.400.

Under current regulations, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38?U.S.C. §?5101(a); 38?C.F.R. §?3.151(a).  The term "application" or "claim" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38?C.F.R. §?3.1. 

The effective date for iron deficiency anemia is August 1, 2023, the date of receipt of an intent to file.  

Turning to the evidence, and to directly address the Veteran's argument, an exception to the general effective date provisions is when an award of benefits is based on a liberalizing law, such as the PACT Act.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

Generally, the effective date of an award based on a liberalizing law is assigned in accordance with the facts found but is usually not earlier than the effective date of the liberalizing law.  The effective date of an award can be the effective date of the liberalizing law if: (1) the claim is reviewed on either VA's initiative or at the request of the claimant within one year of the liberalizing law; and, (2) the claimant met all the relevant eligibility criteria as of that date.  Id.

Here, the record shows the Veteran's iron deficiency anemia was not granted service connection under a liberalizing law.  Rather, the record shows it was granted secondary to service-connected PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), which she alleged on her claim form. 

However, she asserted during the pendency of her claim that it should be considered under the PACT Act.  The Board has considered the effect of the PACT Act on this claim and whether the PACT Act is a liberalizing law with respect to this claim. 

A legal provision that creates "a presumption that, when certain conditions are met, a crucial element of a service-connection case is presumed proved" is a liberalizing law.  Ortiz v. McDonough, 6 F.4th 1267, 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  This is so when the new presumption "eliminate[s] a crucial, concrete component of what [is] required for the veteran's affirmative case to establish entitlement."  Id. at 1280.  A liberalizing law is "one [that brings] about a substantive change in the law creating a new and different entitlement to a benefit."  Spencer v. Brown, 17 F.3d 368, 372 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Spencer II), aff'ing 4 Vet. App. 283 (1993).

Here, the Board does not find that the PACT Act is a liberalizing law with respect to this claim.  Iron deficiency anemia is not listed among the disabilities that are presumed to be related to exposure to burn pits and other toxins.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120.

The Board acknowledges that it is liberalizing to a certain degree in that she is now presumed to have various toxic exposures by virtue of her service in the Persian Gulf.  But she is not claiming anything that is presumed to be related to those exposures.  

The expansion and codification of the presumed exposures in the PACT Act did not create a new and different entitlement to service connection for iron deficiency anemia, she still needs a positive nexus attributing anemia to those exposures.  That is, these newly presumed exposures did not make any real difference to her claim apart from being a different theory of entitlement; they did not prove a crucial component that had been lacking in her claim.  

As noted, the Veteran raised the issue that her anemia was due to exposures from her service in the Persian Gulf.  This issue was not developed by the AOJ, and a VA examination opinion was not obtained.  The Board does not find that was an error in the duty to assist.  The PACT Act did not create a presumption of service connection for anemia.  Rather, the PACT Act set forth that there is a presumption of certain exposures, which are known to cause other conditions that she is not claiming.  The PACT Act also set forth a duty to obtain specific medical opinions when exposures are alleged to be the cause of a claimed disability, but these newer laws pertaining to the way a claim is developed did not create a presumption of service connection or eliminate the need to prove any of the elements of service connection.  

Accordingly, although she had previously claimed service connection for anemia and sought review of it within a year of the enactment of the PACT Act, as required by the regulations pertaining to liberalizing laws (38 C.F.R. § 3.114), the PACT Act has not created a new and different entitlement to service connection for iron deficiency anemia, thus there is no relevant eligibility criteria to apply prior to receipt of the claim.  Id.  In sum, the enactment date of the PACT Act is not available as an effective date in this appeal.

The Board has not identified any other basis for an earlier effective date.  The Veteran's last claim for service connection for iron deficiency anemia was denied in a February 2020 statement of the case.  She did not appeal that decision to the Board, and it is final.  Since then, no claims for anemia were received and left unadjudicated.

Accordingly, the earliest available date for service connection for iron deficiency anemia is August 1, 2023, the date of receipt of her intent to file.  This claim must be denied.

2. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of a 30 percent rating for IBS is denied.

3. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of a 50 percent rating for sinusitis is denied.

The Veteran has appealed for an earlier effective date for the grant of 30 percent for her IBS and the grant of 50 percent for sinusitis.  She asserts that each should be assigned from August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the PACT Act.

The Veteran's IBS and sinusitis have been service connected since October 1, 2012, and service connection was in effect when her claim for a higher rating was filed, via an intent to file, on August 1, 2023.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument pertaining to the PACT Act, but the provisions of the PACT Act do not pertain to the assignment of disability ratings.

Rather, the effective date of an increased rating is established as the date of the claim or the date entitlement arose.  If service connection is already established, as here, the effective date of an increased rating may be assigned earlier if it is factually ascertainable that the increase occurred in the year preceding the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

Thus, as the Veteran's intent to file was received on August 1, 2023, the Board reviewed the evidence in the year preceding the intent to file, back to August 1, 2022.  After review, the Board does not find a basis to assign either increased rating in the year preceding August 1, 2023.  The record does not show that her IBS symptoms met the criteria for a 30 percent rating, or that her sinusitis symptoms met the criteria for a 50 percent rating, until the November 2023 VA examination.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.97, 4.114, DCs 6512, 7319. 

The Board finds these claims have been adequately developed, and there is no suggestion that there are outstanding records not obtained for review.  The Veteran is advised that if she has knowledge or possession of evidence showing an increase in severity of IBS and/or sinusitis in the year preceding receipt of her August 1, 2023, claim, she should find it along with a supplemental claim within a year of this decision.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that the effective date of August 1, 2023, for the grant of 30 percent for IBS and 50 percent for sinusitis, is the earliest available effective date available.  These appeals are denied.

4. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA is denied.

The Veteran has appealed for an effective date earlier than August 1, 2023, for the grant of eligibility to DEA benefits.  

DEA benefits are payable to the child or surviving spouse of a Veteran, who will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) The Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran had a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability.  38?U.S.C. §?3510; 38?C.F.R. §?3.807(a). 

The current effective date has been assigned based on the Veteran's combined rating totalling 100 percent, and being found to have permanent and total service-connected disability.  Prior to August 1, 2023, her combined rating is 90 percent, not 100 percent. 

In this decision, the Board denied assigning earlier effective dates for the grant of service connection for anemia, or for higher ratings for IBS or sinusitis.  Thus, her rating prior to August 1, 2023, remains less than total.  There is no other basis to assign an earlier effective date for DEA benefits.  Accordingly, this claim must be denied.
