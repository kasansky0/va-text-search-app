ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the medical evidence of record shows a current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, which is presumed to be associated with his exposure to herbicide agents.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for diabetes mellitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1116, 1137, 5017; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1970 to December 1971.

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus as a result of his military service in the Republic of Vietnam.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In addition, certain diseases, to include diabetes mellitus, type II, shall be service-connected if the Veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active service even though there is no record of such disease during service, provided that the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d) are satisfied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

Initially, the Board notes that the January 2024 rating decision on appeal noted that the Veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam, and that his exposure to herbicide agents was conceded.

The Board also notes that, in April 2025, the Veteran submitted a January 2023 private treatment record showing a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.  

As the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents, and diabetes mellitus is listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e) as a disease associated with exposure to herbicide agents, service connection is presumed.  Thus, entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus is granted.
