ORDER

New and relevant evidence not having been submitted, the application to readjudicate the claim as to hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Evidence received since the January 2024 rating decision is not new and relevant to the issue of hearing loss.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudicating the claim as to hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5108, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1978 to March 1981.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As a final preliminary matter, the Board is cognizant that an attorney-representative was appointed by the Veteran in February 2025. The attorney-representative withdrew in March 2025.  As the attorney-representative did not act on the Veteran's behalf before the Board in any way in the instant appeal, the Board finds the Veteran is pro se in this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.6.

Whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted regarding the claim as to bilateral hearing loss.

In order to readjudicate a previously disallowed claim, new and relevant evidence must be received. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

VA regulations provide that a claimant who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim any time after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending or has become finally adjudicated. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.  If new and relevant evidence is not presented or secured, the AOJ will issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim.  In determining whether new and relevant evidence is presented or secured, VA will consider any evidence received after VA issued notice of a decision on the claim and while the evidentiary record was closed.  Id. 

New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.  Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  For VA to readjudicate the claim, the evidentiary record must include new and relevant evidence that was not of record as of the date of notice of the prior decision.  Upon receipt of a substantially complete supplemental claim, VA's duty to assist in the gathering of evidence under § 3.159 of this part is triggered and includes any such assistance that may help secure new and relevant evidence as defined in paragraph (a) of 38 C.F.R. 

§ 3.2501 to complete the supplemental claim application.  Id.  

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim from which this appeal arises.

As relevant to this appeal, service connection for bilateral hearing loss was granted in an August 2023 rating decision. Subsequently, in an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ finalized severance of service connection for this disability. The Veteran filed subsequent requests for review of this decision. In relevant part, the AOJ issued a January 2024 HLR rating decision on this issue. Thereafter, the Veteran filed the Supplemental Claim on a VA Form 20-0995 that resulted in the March 2024 rating decision that is subject of this appeal. Although service connection was previously in effect for hearing loss, the current question before the Board is whether new and relevant evidence was submitted between the January 2024 rating decision and the Supplemental Rating Decision issued in March 2024. 

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal found that new and relevant evidence had not been submitted since a prior January 20024 decision to readjudicate the claim.  

Between the January 2024 decision and the March 2024 decision, VA did not receive any new evidence not cumulative of that previously of record. There were not lay contentions added to the record that were not previously of file nor new relevant medical evidence submitted. VA treatment records were added, but these records did not contain audiological records or treatment of hearing loss. The was no new evidence that tended to prove or disprove a matter at issue - here, whether service connection was warranted or that there was error in the finding of severance of service connection.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has not been received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1).  Accordingly, the request to readjudicate the matter is denied.
