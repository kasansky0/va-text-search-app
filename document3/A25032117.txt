ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability evaluation in excess of 20 percent for left hip arthritis and tendinopathy (based on impairment of thigh motion) is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability evaluation for left hip arthritis and tendinopathy (based on limitation of extension) is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability evaluation for left hip arthritis and tendinopathy (based on limitation of flexion) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran cannot cross his legs, and at worst, experiences loss of abduction in his left hip of 10 degrees (during a flare-up). 

2. The Veteran's left hip extension, at worst, is 20 degrees (during a flare-up).

3. The Veteran's left hip flexion, at worst, is 70 degrees (during a flare-up).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial disability evaluation in excess of 20 percent, for left hip arthritis and tendinopathy (based on impairment of thigh motion), have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.14, 4.59, 4.71, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable disability evaluation for left hip arthritis and tendinopathy (based on limitation of extension), have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.14, 4.59, 4.71, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5251.

3. criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable disability evaluation for left hip arthritis and tendinopathy (based on limitation of flexion), have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.14, 4.59, 4.71, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1973 until his honorable discharge in May 1994.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Increased Rating

1. Entitlement to an initial disability evaluation in excess of 20 percent for left hip arthritis and tendinopathy (based on impairment of thigh motion) is denied.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability evaluation for left hip arthritis and tendinopathy (based on limitation of extension) is denied.

3. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability evaluation for left hip arthritis and tendinopathy (based on limitation of flexion) is denied.

The Veteran disagrees with the initial evaluations assigned for his left hip disability in the May 2024 initial rating decision, on account of "daily pain and discomfort associated with this condition." See May 2024 VA Form 10182.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

A Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). Where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). Staged ratings are appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance. Functional loss may be due to the absence or deformity of structures or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior in undertaking the motion. Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled. 38 C.F.R. § 4.40. In Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011), the Court held that, although pain may cause a functional loss, "pain itself does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by VA regulations applicable to the musculoskeletal system." Rather, pain may result in functional loss, but only if it limits the ability "to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, or endurance." Id., quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40.

With respect to joints, in particular, the factors of disability reside in reductions of normal excursion of movements in different planes. Inquiry will be directed to more or less than normal movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, deformity or atrophy of disuse. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45.

The intent of the Rating Schedule is to recognize actually painful, unstable or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. In Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011), the Court found that, when 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record, even in non-arthritis contexts, the Board should address its applicability.

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5250 to 5255, provide the criteria for rating hip and thigh disabilities. Normal range of motion for the hip is to 125 degrees of flexion, to zero degrees of extension, and to 45 degrees of abduction. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

In evaluating the Veteran's level of disability, the Board will consider all applicable Diagnostic Codes.

Under Diagnostic Code 5250, for ankylosis of the hip, a 60 percent rating is assigned for favorable ankylosis, in flexion at an angle between 20 degrees and 40 degrees, and slight adduction or abduction; a 70 percent rating is assigned for intermediate ankylosis; and a 90 percent rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis, extremely unfavorable ankylosis, with the foot not reaching the ground, and crutches necessitated. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5250.

Under Diagnostic Code 5251, for limitation of extension of the thigh, a 10 percent rating is assigned where extension is limited to 5 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5251.

Under Diagnostic Code 5252, for limitation of flexion of the thigh, where flexion is limited to 45 degrees, a 10 percent evaluation is assigned; where flexion is limited to 30 degrees, a 20 percent evaluation is assigned; where flexion is limited to 20 degrees, a 30 percent evaluation is assigned; and where flexion is limited to 10 degrees, a 40 percent evaluation is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252.

Under Diagnostic Code 5253, for impairment of the thigh, when rotation is limited, such that one cannot toe-out more than 15 degrees, or adduction limited, such that one cannot cross her legs, a 10 percent evaluation is assigned. When abduction is limited beyond 10 degrees, a 20 percent evaluation is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.

If the hip has become a flail joint, the rating is 80 percent under Diagnostic Code 5254. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. Diagnostic Code 5254.

Under Diagnostic Code 5255, a fracture of the femur with nonunion or false joint may be rated at 60 or 80 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. Diagnostic Code 5255.

The Veteran's left hip disability is rated under Diagnostic Codes 5024-5251, 5024-5252, and 5024-5253. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the specific basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown as a hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Here, the Veteran is rated under Diagnostic Code 5024, for tendinopathy, which directs that the disability be evaluated as degenerative arthritis, based on limitation of motion of the affected joint, which, in the present case, is the left hip, as evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 5251 (limitation of extension), 5252 (limitation of flexion), and 5253 (impairment of thigh motion). 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

In connection with his claim, the Veteran underwent a VA contract examination in March 2024. The examiner noted the Veteran's diagnoses for bilateral hip osteoarthritis, left hip post-traumatic arthritis, and left hip tendinopathy (tendinitis). The examiner took a medical history from the Veteran. The Veteran reported that his condition began in December 1981 as a result of rappelling over a waterfall at night (the Veteran landed awkwardly on his backside). His symptoms initially included pain and soreness. The Veteran's treatment included ibuprofen. The Veteran reported that his condition worsened in April 1982 while parachuting (he began to oscillate after switching to a different type of parachute for this landing); at this time, he felt a pop in his left hip area but continued despite this sensation. He reported that his condition again worsened in 2016, beginning with weakness in his left leg, then dull pain. He was treated with physical therapy and Celebrex for pain management. His current symptoms include dull pain, which increases in severity when going up stairs or getting up from a sitting position. He cannot sleep on his left side. Pressure on his left hip increases the pain ("like a trigger pressure point"). He experiences continuous awakenings at night on account of his hip. When he walks, sometimes, his leg drops. The Veteran reported falling several years ago while running because his leg did not hold up. His left hip disability affects the way he walks. He experiences tenderness when the bony part of his outside hip is touched. His pain is worse in the morning, and he has to walk around a while to warm it up. His disability limits his hiking and yard activities, and he is careful not to overuse his hip or overextend his gait. He used to run but is limited by pain and has not really been able to run since 2017. He is unable to jump and experiences limitations with certain exercises including bending, squatting, going up and down stairs, getting in and out of a car, getting in and out of bed, getting up from a seating position; he also experiences limitations with prolonged walking, standing, and sitting; his sleep quality is affected by his disability. The Veteran experiences moderate flare-ups of the left hip, which occur one to two times a week and are precipitated by stop-and-go activities, "sometimes normal use," hiking, lifting weights, or bending over to lift weights. The left hip flare-ups are alleviated by Celebrex, rest, and activity modification. The Veteran experiences functional loss with repeated use over time, as described previously. See supra. The Veteran's range of motion initially was measured as: flexion - 90 degrees; extension - 30 degrees; abduction - 25 degrees; adduction - 15 degrees; external rotation - 30 degrees; internal rotation - 20 degrees. The Veteran experienced pain with flexion, abduction, adduction, external rotation, and internal rotation. The examiner indicated that a limitation in adduction prevented the Veteran from crossing his legs. Passive range of motion testing yielded identical results as active range of motion testing. There was not objective evidence of crepitus, but there was objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation (location is anterior-lateral hip; severity is mild to moderate; this is related to osteoarthritis). The Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing with at least three repetitions but there was not additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions. The Veteran was not being examined immediately after repeated use over time, but the procured evidence suggested that pain, weakness, and lack of endurance would result in additional functional loss, expressed in terms of range of motion as follows: flexion - 80 degrees; extension - 25 degrees; abduction - 15 degrees; adduction - 10 degrees; external rotation - 20 degrees; internal rotation - 15 degrees. The Veteran was not being examined during a flare-up, but the procured evidence suggested that pain, weakness, and lack of endurance would result in additional functional loss, expressed in terms of range of motion as follows: flexion - 70 degrees; extension - 20 degrees; abduction - 10 degrees; adduction - 5 degrees; external rotation - 15 degrees; internal rotation - 10 degrees. The examiner reported there were no additional contributing factors of disability. The examiner indicated the Veteran did not have muscle atrophy. The examiner indicated there was no ankylosis of the hip or thigh. The examiner indicated that the veteran did not have malunion or non-union of the femur, a flail hip joint, or a leg length discrepancy. The examiner indicated that the Veteran had not undergone surgery in connection with his left hip disability. The examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs or symptoms related to his condition. The Veteran did not use any assistive devices as a normal mode of locomotion (i.e., a brace, a wheelchair, crutches, canes, or a walker). The examiner indicated that functioning was not so diminished that amputation with prosthesis would equally serve the Veteran. Imaging studies were not performed in connection with this examination, but the examiner reviewed bilateral hip x-rays from December 2022 and March 2024. While the March 2024 x-rays were negative, the December 2024 x-rays reported mild osteoarthritis bilaterally and a calcification, which may be where a tendon tore off the bone in a past, old injury. The examiner noted that "osteoarthritis is a progressive disease and not likely to improve or go away."

The Veteran's VA treatment records note complaints related to left hip pain in March 2011. When the Veteran's x-rays were reviewed by VA in December 2022, his physician advised him to keep taking his Celebrex and to take additional Tylenol as needed for pain.

The Board has reviewed the available evidence and finds that initial increased ratings in excess of those which have already been assigned are not for application. In this regard, the Veteran cannot cross his legs, and at worst (during a flare-up) does not experience loss of abduction beyond 10 degrees (the Veteran's abduction, instead, is estimated at precisely 10 degrees, during a flare-up). His flexion at worst (during a flare-up) is estimated as 70 degrees, which is noncompensable (flexion must be limited to 45 degrees or worse for a compensable rating). At worst, his extension is limited to 20 degrees (during a flare-up), which is also deemed noncompensable (extension must be limited to 5 degrees or worse for a compensable rating). The Veteran does not experience a flail joint, ankylosis (favorable or unfavorable), malunion or non-union of the femur. The Board has considered the ameliorative effects of medication but notes that the Veteran reported taking medication precisely to alleviate flare-ups, thereby establishing that his disability is at its worst during a flare-up, prior to the administration of medication. Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims, No. 23-1798 (Mar. 12, 2025) (holding that the Board must discount the beneficial effects of medication used to treat a service-connected disability when the relevant diagnostic code does not specifically contemplate medication use).

In sum, the Board does not find that increased initial ratings beyond those which have already been assigned are for application. In reaching this decision the Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim, the doctrine is not for application, and the claim is, therefore, denied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
