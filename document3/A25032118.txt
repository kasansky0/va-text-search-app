ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right knee disability is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for left knee disability is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for lumbar spine disability, to include degenerative disc disease (DDD), is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The appellant's current right knee disability is not etiologically related to his military service.

2. The appellant's current left knee disability is not etiologically related to his military service.

3. The appellant's lumbar spine disability, to include DDD, did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; and the disability is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right knee disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left knee disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for lumbar spine disability, to include DDD are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant had active service in the United States Air Force from March 2004 to April 2007.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) of a March 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ)), which denied service connection for right knee disability, left knee disability, and back disability.   In October 2023, the appellant submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD (via VA Form 10182)), appealing the August 2023 HLR rating decision to the Board, and requesting Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  

Evidentiary Window

As the appellant selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Service Connection

Generally, to establish a direct service connection claim a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1164, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right knee disability is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left knee disability is denied.

The appellant contends that his current right and left knee disabilities are related to an injury he sustained during his military service. See Statement in Support of Claim (VA Form 21-4138), February 20, 2023.

Analysis

In the March 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found the appellant to have current diagnoses of right and left knee strain. Favorable findings made by the AOJ are generally binding on the Board, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c); 20.801(a). Such evidence is not present in this case. Accordingly, the first element required under Shedden is met. See Shedden, supra.

Regarding the second element, in-service incurrence, although the appellant asserts that he injured both knees and was seen by a medic multiple times in service, the appellant's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for complaints of or treatment for a knee disability during service. See VA Form 21-4138, February 20, 2023. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the appellant was diagnosed with or treated for a right or left knee disability within one year of discharge. Therefore, the second element required by Shedden, in-service disease or injury, is not satisfied.  See Shedden, supra.

A thorough review of post-service VA and private treatment records reveal that the first and only instance of report of knee symptomatology was during a January 2017 VA primary care appointment, at which time the appellant reported occasional pain in his knees. See VA Treatment Record, January 9, 2017.

In March 2023, the appellant was afforded a VA examination and medical opinion obtained. See VA Knee and Lower Leg Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), March 3, 2023; VA Medical Opinion DBQ, March 3, 2023. During the examination, the appellant reported that his bilateral knee disability started around 2008 and progressed over the years. See VA Knee and Lower Leg DBQ, March 3, 2023. The appellant was diagnosed with bilateral knee strain. Id. The clinician opined that it was less likely that the appellant's right and left knee strain were caused by knee issues during service because of the "long gap of silence in medical record for about 10 years since the initial knee pain report." See VA Medical Opinion DBQ, March 3, 2023. 

While a VA examiner may not rely on the lack of evidence alone to assess nexus, it can be weighed against the appellant's claims of continuity of symptomatology.  The Board does find that the VA clinician reviewed the appellant's STRs and treatment records, noted such review; and considered the appellant's lay statements. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). While the Board acknowledges the appellant's statement that he was seen multiple times in service with complaints of pain, weakness, and popping in his knees, there is no medical evidence of record to substantiate these claims.  See VA Form 21-4138, February 20, 2023.  Further, there is no evidence of medical treatment for knee disabilities after service, nor is there any other medical evidence in support of his claims.  As such, the Board finds the VA examiner's opinion to be of some probative value.

The persuasive evidence of record does not support a finding that the appellant's current right and left knee disabilities are etiologically related to his military service. Furthermore, the opinion of the VA clinician is not contradicted by any other medical evidence of record. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991) (VA may only consider independent medical evidence to support its findings and is not permitted to base decisions on its own unsubstantiated medical conclusions). Neither the appellant nor his representative have introduced into the record or identified any evidence of record which provides a link between his military service and his bilateral knee sprains.

While the appellant is competent to report having experienced symptoms of knee pain, he is not competent to provide a nexus opinion in this case. The issue is medically complex, and the evidence does not reflect that the appellant has the requisite medical expertise to provide a complex medical opinion. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Additionally, as noted above, the appellant's statements are not supported by the evidence of record. 

As there is no evidence which supports a finding that there is a causal relationship between the appellant's right and left knee strains and his military service, the third element of Shedden, is not satisfied. See Shedden, supra. As there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve, service connection for a right and left knee disabilities are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102.

3. Entitlement to service connection for lumbar spine disability, to include DDD, is denied.

The appellant contends that his current lumbar spine disability is related to military service. See VA Form 21-4138, February 20, 2023. Specifically, he asserts that he was seen several times during his active duty service for lower back pain. Id. 

Analysis

In the March 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found the appellant to have a current diagnosis of lumbosacral strain. Favorable findings made by the AOJ are generally binding on the Board, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c); 20.801(a). Such evidence is not present in this case. Accordingly, the first element required under Shedden is met.  See Shedden, supra.

Regarding the second element, in-service incurrence, although the appellant asserts that he was seen multiple times for lower back pain, the appellant's STRs are silent for complaints of or treatment for a back disability during service. See VA Form 21-4138, February 20, 2023. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the appellant was diagnosed with or treated for a back disability within one year of discharge. Therefore, the second element required by Shedden, in-service disease or injury, is not satisfied. See Shedden, supra.

A thorough review of post-service VA and private treatment records reveal that the first instance of report of knee symptomatology was during a January 2017 VA primary care appointment, at which time the appellant reported occasional lower back pain. See VA Treatment Record, January 9, 2017. During a March 2020 VA appointment, the appellant reported severe lower back and tail bone pain. See VA Treatment Record, March 12, 2020. In August 2021, the appellant was in a motor vehicle accident and reported lower back pain. See VA Treatment Record, August 30, 2021.  An August 2021 VA x-ray of the lumbar spine revealed DDD at L5-S1. See VA Treatment Record, August 30, 2021. The credible evidence relating to the current disability weighs against a finding that the appellant's lumbar spine DDD has been productive of symptoms continuously since service. As such, service connection is not warranted on a presumptive basis. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 5017; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.307, 3.309.

As to whether the appellant's lumbar spine disability is otherwise related to service, in March 2023, the appellant was afforded a VA examination, and a medical opinion was obtained. See VA Back DBQ, March 3, 2023. The appellant reported his back pain started around 2008 and has progressed over the years. See VA Back DBQ, March 3, 2023. The appellant was diagnosed with lumbosacral strain. Id. The clinician opined that it was less likely that the appellant's back pain was caused by back issues during service because of the "long gap of silence in medical record for about 14 years since the initial back pain report." See VA Medical Opinion DBQ, March 3, 2023.

Again, while a VA examiner may not rely on the lack of evidence alone to assess nexus, it can be weighed against the appellant's claims of continuity of symptomatology.  The Board does find that the VA clinician reviewed the appellant's STRs and treatment records, noted such review; and considered the appellant's lay statements. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). While the Board acknowledges the appellant's statement that he was seen multiple times in service with complaints of low back pain, there is no medical evidence of record to substantiate this claim.  See VA Form 21-4138, February 20, 2023.  Further, there is no evidence of medical treatment for a back disability after service, nor is there any other medical evidence in support of his claim.  As such, the Board finds the VA examiner's opinion to be of some probative value.

While the appellant is competent to report having experienced symptoms of his lumbar spine disorder, he is not competent to provide a nexus opinion in this case. The issue is medically complex, and the evidence does not reflect that the appellant has the requisite medical expertise to provide a complex medical opinion.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Additionally, as noted above, the appellant's statements are not supported by the evidence of record. 

As there is no evidence which supports a finding that there is a causal relationship between the appellant's lumbar spine disability and his military service, the third element of Shedden, is not satisfied. See Shedden, supra. As there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve, service connection for lumbar spine disability, to include DDD is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102.
