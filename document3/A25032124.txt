ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for Raynaud's Syndrome is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for insomnia is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other specified trauma and stressor related disorder is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. An October 2014 rating decision denied reopening of the Veteran's claim for service connection for Raynaud's disease as no new and material evidence was submitted at that time.  VA received the Veteran's NOD regarding service connection for Raynaud's disease more than one year after notification of the October 2014 rating decision was mailed.

2. A January 2020 rating decision denied service connection for insomnia.  VA received the Veteran's NOD regarding service connection for insomnia more than one year after notification of the January 2020 rating decision was mailed.

3. A January 2020 rating decision denied service connection for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder.  VA received the Veteran's NOD regarding service connection for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder more than one year after notification of the January 2020 rating decision was mailed.

4. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his diagnosed PTSD and other specified trauma and stressor related disorder is related to an in-service stressor that has been supported by credible supporting evidence.

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for Raynaud's Syndrome have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, 20.203.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for insomnia have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, 20.203.

3. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, 20.203.

4. The criteria for service connection for PTSD and other specified trauma and stressor related disorder have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1980 to November 1984.

An October 2014 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for the Veteran's Raynaud's Syndrome.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision.

A January 2020 rating decision denied service connection for the Veteran's claims for service connection for insomnia and other specified trauma and stressor related disorder.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision.

A November 2022 rating decision denied service connection for the Veteran's claim for PTSD.  The Veteran subsequently filed a VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim for PTSD in January 2023.  The AOJ again denied service connection for PTSD in the September 2023 rating decision on appeal.

The Veteran timely appealed the September 2023 decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in his April 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) and selected the Direct Review option.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

3. Entitlement to service connection for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder

In a substantive appeal, a claimant or his representative must file an NOD with a determination of the AOJ within one year from the date that the AOJ mailed notice of the determination.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If an NOD is not filed within the prescribed period, the AOJ decision becomes final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.200, 20.201, 20.302, 20.1103 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c).  The Board may waive the issue of the timeliness of a substantive appeal.  An untimely filed NOD violates the mandatory claims-processing rule that bars appellate consideration.  See Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 41 (2009).  "[T]he one-year deadline in section 7105(b) for filing an NOD is not jurisdictional and that the Board is not categorically precluded from considering matters contained in an NOD received outside that timeframe."  Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (U.S. 2024)

This doesn't mean, however, that the one-year deadline is irrelevant.  It is an "important and mandatory" component of section 7105(b)'s claim-processing rule. Henderson, 562 U.S. at 435.  Such a claim-processing rule would be subject to waiver or forfeiture, but if the "mandatory claim-processing rule" is properly invoked, it "must be enforced."  Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs., 583 U.S. 17, 20, 138 S. Ct. 13, 199 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2017).  Hence, VA need not accept an NOD filed outside that one-year period unless a claimant establishes an adequate excuse for the NOD's untimeliness.  Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (U.S. 2024).

Here, the Veteran included "Raynaud's Syndrome," "insomnia," and "other specified trauma or stressor related disorder" on the April 2024 NOD.  The Veteran noted the appeal for Raynaud's Syndrome stemmed from an October 2014 rating decision.  The Veteran noted the appeals for insomnia and other specified trauma or stressor related disorder stemmed from a January 2020 rating decision.

The Board notes the Veteran's most recent Codesheet, from December 2024, reflects that Raynaud's syndrome, insomnia, and other specified trauma and stressor related disorder are not service connected.

First, the Board addresses the appeal for Raynaud's Syndrome.  The most recent in time adjudication of service connection for arthritis occurred in the October 2014 rating decision.  As noted previously, the Veteran did not appeal this decision. Thus, the October 2014 rating decision became final.  Therefore, the April 2024 NOD is untimely as to the appeal for service connection for Raynaud's Syndrome.

Next, the Board addresses the appeals for insomnia and other specified trauma or stressor related disorder.  The most recent in time adjudication for service connection for these claims occurred in the January 2020 rating decision.  As noted previously, the Veteran did not appeal this decision.  Therefore, the Veteran's April 2024 NOD is untimely as to the appeal for service connection for insomnia and other specified trauma or stressor related disorder.

The Board notes the dismissal of this appeal in no way affects the Veteran's September 2024 VA 21-526EZ Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits or the Veteran's right to appeal.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  Inasmuch as the issues before the Board are untimely, the appeals for service connection for Raynaud's Syndrome, insomnia, and other specified trauma or stressor related disorder are dismissed.

4. Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other specified trauma and stressor related disorder is granted.

The Veteran contends his PTSD is related to his service.  Specifically, when stationed in Germany, the Veteran asserts he was on "hot status" at the same time as another soldier who died by electrocution after touching something on the high voltage supply with a jewel screwdriver.  See January 2023 Correspondence (stating he will "never forget that day" in 1982); see also April 2022 VA Form 21-0781 (explaining his shock after the electrocution of a fellow soldier while working on the same project at the same time).

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: 1) a present disability; 2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and 3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  In the absence of a currently diagnosed disorder, symptoms may also reach the level of a disability is they caused impairment of earning capacity.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

In addition to the above requirements, there are particular requirements in 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) for establishing PTSD.  See Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010) ("Simply put, while section 3.303 mandates that there be a link between a current disability and military service, section 3.304(f) sets forth the evidence necessary, in the context of claims for PTSD disability compensation, to establish that link.").  Entitlement to service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304(f), 4.125 (requiring PTSD diagnoses to conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5).  When the Veteran's claimed stressors are not related to combat or fear of hostile or terrorist activity, he must introduce corroborative evidence of his claimed in-service stressors.  See Fossie v. West, 12 Vet. App. 1, 6 (1998).  A veteran's testimony, by itself, cannot, as a matter of law, establish the occurrence of a noncombat stressor. See Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163 (1996).

Initially, the Board notes the AOJ conceded the Veteran's current PTSD diagnosis in the rating decision on appeal.  The Board is bound by favorable findings identified by the AOJ; thus, the first element of service connection for a disability, namely, a current disability has been met.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104; see also Shedden, 381 F.3d 1167. 

Further, the Veteran's diagnosis has changed, overtime, from other specified stressor related disorder to PTSD.  Generally, the scope of a claim for a mental health disability includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim.  See generally, Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  Here, the Board will expand the Veteran's claim to encompass his various psychiatric diagnoses and proceed with the Veteran's claim for PTSD and other specified trauma and stressor related disorder.  See January 2020 VA Mental Disorders Examination, Section I: Diagnosis (other specified trauma and stressor related disorder); see also September 2022 VA Mental Disorders Examination, Section I: Diagnosis (PTSD); see also July 2023 VA Mental Disorders Examination, Section I: Diagnosis (PTSD).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's psychiatric disorder is causally linked to an in-service stressor.

In this regard the Board notes, in partial corroboration of the Veteran's claimed in-service stressor, that the Veteran was stationed in Germany in 1982 with an MOS of Nike Test Equipment Repair.  See generally Military Personnel Record.  The Veteran held a Secret Security Clearance and was a Good Conduct Medal recipient.  The Veteran's leadership generally praised his abilities and even noted he "displays good leadership potential." See Enlisted Evaluation Report for the period of December 1983 to July 1984.  

In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted multiple statements describing the death of a fellow soldier in Germany while working on the same project as noted above.  The Veteran reported that the soldier was working in the RC Van and crossed a 5000-volt power supply which burned off his fingers before he could free himself; the soldier died of his injuries.  See April 2022 VA Form 21-0781.  

The Veteran also submitted what appears to be a public social media post asking if anyone remembers a soldier being electrocuted while working on a radar in 1982.  One person responded they were at the DSB (Defense Science Board) at the time and did not hear of the incident.  Another person, L.P. responded affirmatively that he 1) remembered the incident, 2) named the deceased soldier, 3) noted the RC van and the soldier's fingers.  See January 2022 Correspondence (conversation recorded December 15, 2021).  The Veteran further submitted what appears to be a continuation of the social media conversation in a direct message between him and L.P. in which the Veteran sent a message stating the Department of Defense had no record of the electrocution incident after which L.P. answered that he was on site and physically witnessed the event.  See January 2023 Correspondence (conversation recorded (November 28, 2022). 

In the rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim indicating the VA Records Research Center Response indicated VA was unable to verify the in-service stressor.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's claimed stressor has not been officially corroborated; however, the Board finds that the professional researcher's attempts to corroborate the Veteran's stressor were conducted by searching an incorrect name.  The October 2022 Records Research Center Response shows the professional researcher from the Veteran's Benefits Administration, Office of Field Operations Service, Military Records Research Center completed a comprehensive search on the Veteran's claimed stressor for the death of a fellow soldier, B.H.  The B.H. searched is different from the B.H. named by the Veteran.  Further, the researcher did not report searching any other probable iterations of the name B.H.  The Board further notes VA did not research the Veteran's helicopter crash stressor as reported to VA examiners during his mental health evaluations.  Therefore, while the Board finds the VA researchers to be credible, this evidence is not persuasive and is afforded limited probative value as the wrong name was researched and the helicopter incident was not addressed.  

Additionally, the Board has reviewed the multiple VA examination reports of record in the development of this claim and finds that not a single examiner has called into question the veracity of the Veteran's stressor related stories.  The Board further finds that the Veteran has remained consistent in his reporting of the events surrounding the electrocution of a fellow soldier and the helicopter crash. See January 2020 VA Mental Disorders Examination (noting the Veteran reported a friend was electrocuted while working on radar equipment and witnessing a Black Hawk helicopter crash in Germany); see also September 2022 VA Mental Disorders Examination (noting the Veteran reported his friend attempted to work alone and was electrocuted and died); see also July 2023 VA Mental Disorders Examination (noting the Veteran reported 2 stressors: first, his friend's death by electrocution  while working in the RC Van, and second, witnessing a helicopter crash during an air show that came down approximately 75 yards from his position).  Notably, the September 2022 and July 2023 examiners attributed his current PTSD diagnosis to his stressor- the death of his friend in service.  The July 2023 examiner further attributed his current diagnosis to the helicopter incident as well.

The Board finds the statements made by the Veteran to VA examiners are consistent with duties and events that could reasonably occur given the Veteran's MOS and duty stations. See generally Military Personnel Record (showing DD214 and service in Germany in 1982).  The Board's review of the record reveals no reason to doubt the credibility of the Veteran's reported symptoms and his statements as to their onset, which have been attributed to DSM diagnoses of PTSD.  See, Martinez-Boden v. Wilkie, 28 F.4th 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2022).

To summarize, the Veteran's diagnosis of PTSD has been conceded.  His statements discussed above are competent, credible, and consistent within the record showing an in-service injury occurred.  The VA examiners found that the Veteran had PTSD and other specified trauma and stressor related disorder and the Veteran's in-service stressors contributed to his diagnosis.  Therefore, the criteria for service connection have been met.

For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran has PTSD and other specified trauma and stressor related disorder that is related to an in-service stressor event.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The appeal is granted.
