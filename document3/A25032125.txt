DOCKET NO. 211123-199679
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 23, 2020, for the award of a 100 percent disability rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In June 2023, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from January 1969 to March 1970. This matter is on appeal from an April 2021 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

Unfortunately, the Veteran died in June 2023 during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim at this time and must dismiss this appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

Here, the Veteran's surviving spouse filed an application for dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) in June 2023 which was therefore within one year of the Veteran's death. See September 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative. Additionally, in September 2023, the AOJ granted service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death. See June 2023 VA 21-534EZ Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation or Death Pension by a Surviving Spouse or Child. However, in a September 2023 letter to the Veteran's surviving spouse, the AOJ informed her that at the time of the Veteran's death he had claims that were "not yet final" for which the Veteran's surviving spouse "may be considered an eligible substitute claimant." September 2023 Notification Letter (e.g. VA 20-8993, VA 21-0290, PCGL).

The Board acknowledges that the June 2023 DIC application acts as a substitution request; however, the AOJ must decide all requests for substitution in the first instance. See 38?C.F.R. §?3.1010(e)(1). To date, the AOJ has not ruled the June 2023 request and has only established the Veteran's surviving spouse as an individual who "may be considered an eligible substitute claimant." September 2023 Notification Letter (e.g. VA 20-8993, VA 21-0290, PCGL). Therefore, the Board must dismiss the Veteran's pending appeal for lack of jurisdiction. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a). If the request for substitution is granted, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket. Id.
