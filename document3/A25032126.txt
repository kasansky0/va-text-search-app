ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, his erectile dysfunction is secondary to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for erectile dysfunction as secondary to service-connected obstructive sleep apnea are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1985 to November 1985, and from February 2003 to September 2003.

By way of background, in March 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of his claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction, most recently addressed in a May 2019 rating decision.

In March 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received, and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 20-0995 and requested readjudication of his claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction, most recently addressed in the March 2022 supplemental claim decision.

In October 2023, the AOJ issued another supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received, and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the October 2023 rating decision.  In March 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 decision.  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

The Veteran contends that his erectile dysfunction is secondary to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea. See November 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.

Initially, the Board notes that the March 2024 rating decision on appeal made the favorable finding that the Veteran had a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted a December 2019 opinion from C.M.B., who noted that the Veteran had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea with symptoms such as interrupted sleep, paused beathing with associated hypoxia, and daytime sleepiness with fatigue.  C.M.B then noted that medical literature noted that those with obstructive sleep apnea experienced a loss in sexual interest and arousal, and that they experienced an overall interference in intimacy with associated erectile dysfunction and orgasm incapability related to both somatic symptoms and documented hormonal changes. Ultimately, C.M.B. concluded that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was secondary to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea.

Although the AOJ obtained opinions in May 2016, May 2019, January 2022, and December 2023 addressing whether the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was secondary to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea, none of these opinions are adequate, as they do not address whether the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is aggravated by his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea. When VA undertakes to either provide an examination or to obtain an opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). Accordingly, the Board finds the VA medical opinions are insufficient to decide the claim. These opinions are afforded little, if any, probative weight. 

The Board also noted that the May 2019 opinion was supportive of relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and the development of erectile dysfunction, noting that obstructive sleep apnea was a risk factor of erectile dysfunction, independent of other confounders, and that men who present with sleep disorders should also be questioned about the presence of erectile dysfunction.

In contrast, the Board affords the private medical opinion by C.M.B. highly probative. The private medical opinion provided a review and assessment of the Veteran's symptoms and pertinent medical evidence discussing the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and sexual dysfunction. In addition, C.M.B. provided an opinion supported by a clear rationale. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). Accordingly, this opinion is afforded high probative weight. 

In sum, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, and the only probative opinion of record is in support of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection. Moreover, there is no sufficient basis for the Board to reject this supportive opinion and to further develop the claim. Cf. Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).

Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for erectile dysfunction is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
