ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided on January 18, 2017, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment of the cost of medical care provided to the Veteran on January 18, 2017.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided on January 18, 2017, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished services to the Veteran. The appellant billed VA $2,782.00 for the services provided.

In March 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal from the appellant electing the evidence submission docket to review a decision issued by a VA AOJ.  

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on January 18, 2017, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending. The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and entitlement to payment was approved for the January 18, 2017, episode of care. A May 2021 explanation of payment (EOP) sent to the appellant states that the claim was paid at that time in the amount of $1,761.00. In a January 2022 letter, VA informed the appellant that the claim was paid on May 24, 2021.

The Board acknowledges that the payment is less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care. If the amount paid for the January 18, 2017, episode of care is disagreeable to the appellant, they may file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the January 18, 2017, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the denial of payment and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal. No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
