ORDER

The appeal pertaining to the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee instability is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a final decision issued in February 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) granted a separate 10 percent rating, but no higher, for left knee instability.

2. In a March 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) implemented the Board's February 2024 award, and the Veteran did not file a timely appeal of the Board's decision or submit a timely Supplemental Claim to continuously pursue the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The February 2024 Board Decision that granted a separate 10 percent rating for left knee instability is final.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7103, 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.

2. As the claim on appeal had already been finally decided by the Board, there is no justiciable case or controversy as to the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee instability, and the criteria for dismissal of the appeal of that issue have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5108, 7266; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1100, 20.1105.

REASON AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1982 to March 1988.  

This matter comes to the Board on appeal from a rating decision issued in July 2024 under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  

In July 2024, the Veteran's attorney submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, and requested the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In a February 2024 Decision, the Board awarded a separate 10 percent rating for the Veteran's left knee instability.  Such decision is final on the day that it was mailed, subject to certain procedural exceptions.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7103, 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.  In this regard, a Board decision may be challenged by appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) within 120 days, or a motion to the Board for reconsideration, vacatur, or revision or reversal based on clear and unmistakable error.  38 U.S.C. § 7266.  Additionally, the AMA provides the additional option for a claimant to file a Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) with the AOJ within one year following the issuance of a Board decision so as to continuously pursue the matter at issue.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1105.  

However, in the instant case, the Veteran did not appeal the February 2024 Board Decision to the Court, has not filed a motion for reconsideration, vacatur, or revision or reversal based on clear and unmistakable error, and did not file a Supplemental Claim within one year of such decision; as such, the Board Decision is final.

Thereafter, a March 2024 rating decision implemented the Board's award of a separate 10 percent rating for left knee instability.  In such rating decision, the Veteran was advised that the Board decided his appeal on February 29, 2024, and the instant rating decision implemented such decision.  Nevertheless, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review request with the March 2024 rating decision, and as a result, the AOJ issued the spurious July 2024 rating decision on appeal.  

Based on this procedural history, such issue is not properly before the Board.  The Veteran cannot challenge the merits of the Board's February 2024 decision by expressing disagreement in the form of a Higher-Level Review request with the AOJ's implementing decision.  Harris v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 345, 348 (2005); Smith v. Brown, 35 F.3d 1516, 1526 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (construction of regulation to permit review by RO of a Board decision to be avoided); Donovan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 404, 409 (1997) ("an [AOJ] must not be placed in the anomalous position of reviewing the decision of the [Board], a superior tribunal").

In sum, in February 2024, the Board issued a decision addressing the issue of entitlement to a separate rating for left knee instability, which became final on the date it was mailed and no exceptions to finality apply.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 5108, 7103, 7104, 7266; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1100, 20.1105.  When the AOJ implemented the Board's decision in the March 2024 rating decision, the issue was already final and not subject to review by the AOJ absent the filing of a timely Supplemental Claim.

Therefore, there is no justiciable case or controversy as to the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee instability.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the appeal must be dismissed to the extent that the Veteran initially was attempting to appeal the March 2024 AOJ implementing decision.
