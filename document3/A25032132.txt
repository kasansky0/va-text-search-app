ORDER

The appeal of the discontinuance of a separate 50 percent rating for insomnia disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9413, effective as of June 25, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Service connection has been established for persistent depressive disorder with insomnia and alcohol use disorder rated as 50 percent disabling from July 14, 2010 to March 27, 2024 and 70 percent disabling from March 28, 2024 under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9433.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

A 50 percent rating from July 14, 2010, to March 27, 2024, and a 70 percent rating from March 28, 2024, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9433 for persistent depressive disorder with insomnia and alcohol use disorder has been assigned; no specific error of fact or law remains.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from February 1984 to June 1993.  He served in Saudi Arabia.

In May 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction proposed to discontinue the separate 50 percent rating for insomnia disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9413.  In February 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction discontinued the separate 50 percent rating for insomnia disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9413; effectuated the discontinuance of the separate rating as of June 25, 2020; and recharacterized the service-connected right knee disability as "right knee strain with degenerative joint disease, tendinitis, and insomnia."  In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review Docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 3.301, 20.801.

Dismissal

The Veteran asserts that the discontinuance of the separate 50 percent rating for insomnia disorder was improper.

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided.  Both the use of manifestations not resulting from service-connected disease or injury in establishing the service-connected evaluation, and the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses are to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Separate compensable ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).

In May 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction established service connection for insomnia disorder; assigned a 50 percent rating for that disability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9413; and effectuated the award as of June 24, 2020.  In June 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction found a clear and unmistakable error when it assigned the effective date of June 24, 2020 for the 50 percent rating for insomnia disorder and assigned an appropriate effective date of June 25, 2020.

In May 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction proposed to discontinue the separate 50 percent rating for insomnia disorder.  It was stated that "VA regulations state that when insomnia is adequately identified as a symptom of another underlying disability, service connection should be established for that diagnosis rather than for insomnia."  In February 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction discontinued the separate 50 percent rating for insomnia disorder; effectuated the discontinuance of the separate rating as of June 25, 2020; and rated insomnia with the service-connected right knee disability as "right knee strain with degenerative joint disease, tendinitis, and insomnia."  The February 2024 Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision stated that the basis for the discontinuance of the separate rating for insomnia disorder was "VA regulations state that a separate evaluation is not warranted for insomnia that is considered secondary to, or a symptom of, another disability.  A separate service-connected evaluation for a diagnosis of insomnia disorder is only warranted if all other potential causes are ruled out and service connection can be established on a direct basis."

In February 2025, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction established service connection for persistent depressive disorder with insomnia and alcohol use disorder; assigned a 50 percent rating from July 14, 2010 to March 27, 2024 and a 70 percent rating from March 28, 2024 under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9433.  It was stated that "insomnia was rated with your service-connected right knee strain with degenerative joint disease with tendinitis, however, since insomnia was noted on mental health exams, insomnia will now be rated with your persistent depressive disorder and alcohol use disorder."  Notably, the February 2025 Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted a greater benefit to the Veteran by establishing service connection for persistent depressive disorder with insomnia and alcohol use disorder and assigning a 50 percent rating effective as of July 14, 2010 to March 27, 2024.  See Johnson v. Collins, No. 23-7589, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 383 (Vet. App. March 26, 2025) (a pending appeal is not rendered moot by a subsequent award of service connection based on a liberalizing law).

The Veteran seeks to have restored a separate 50 percent rating for insomnia disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9413, effective as of June 25, 2020.  However, the service-connected persistent depressive disorder with insomnia and alcohol use disorder is now rated 50 percent disabling from July 14, 2010, to March 27, 2024, and 70 percent disabling from March 28, 2024, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9433.  The restoration of a separate rating for insomnia disorder would constitute impermissible pyramiding because the insomnia disability would be evaluated under two different diagnostic codes.  This is prohibited under 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  There is no case or controversy over which the Board could issue a decision.  Therefore, the Board concludes that no allegation of fact or law remains as to this issue, and the appeal must be dismissed.
