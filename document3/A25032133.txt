ORDER

From December 9, 2014 to January 25, 2015, entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for a gastrointestinal disability is denied.

From January 26, 2015 to June 28, 2018, entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for a gastrointestinal disability is denied.

From June 29, 2018, entitlement to a rating in excess of 60 percent for a gastrointestinal disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. From December 9, 2014 to January 25, 2015, the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability did not result in a moderate gastric ulcer with recurring episodes of severe symptoms two to three times per year averaging 10 days in duration; or with continuous moderate manifestations; or persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.

2. From January 26, 2015 to June 28, 2018, the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability did not result in moderately severe symptoms; less than severe symptoms but with impairment of health manifested by anemia and weight loss; or recurrent incapacitating episodes averaging 10 days or more in duration at least four or more times a year; or symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

3. From June 29, 2018, the Veteran is in receipt of the highest schedular rating, and neither the Veteran nor his representative have contended, nor does the evidence reflect, that he has experienced symptoms outside of those contemplated by the rating criteria.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. From December 9, 2014 to January 25, 2015, the criteria for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for a gastrointestinal disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7399-7346.

2. From January 26, 2015 to June 28, 2018, the criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for a gastrointestinal disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7399-7346.

3. From June 29, 2018, entitlement to a rating in excess of 60 percent for a gastrointestinal disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7399-7304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1990 to March 1993.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2021 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating Criteria

Ratings under diagnostic codes 7301 to 7329, inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348 inclusive will not be combined with each other.  A single evaluation will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114.

The Veteran's gastrointestinal conditions are under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Codes (DC) 7399-7304 for gastric ulcer and 7399-7346 for hiatal hernia.  The Board has also considered whether a higher rating is warranted under DC 7307 for gastritis as the Veteran has also been diagnosed with this condition.

Under Diagnostic Code 7304, a 10 percent rating is warranted for gastric ulcer that is mild, with recurring symptoms once or twice yearly.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7304.  A 20 percent evaluation is warranted for moderate; recurring episodes of severe symptoms two to three times per year averaging 10 days in duration; or with continuous moderate manifestations.  Id.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for moderately severe; less than severe but with impairment of health manifested by anemia and weight loss; or recurrent incapacitating episodes averaging 10 days or more in duration at least four or more times a year.  Id.  A schedular maximum 60 percent rating is warranted for severe; pain only partially relieved by standard ulcer therapy, periodic vomiting, recurrent hematemesis or melena, with manifestations of anemia and weight loss productive of definite impairment of health.  

The terms "mild," "moderate," and "severe" are not defined in the schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. The use of terminology such as "moderate" or "severe" by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue.  All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Pursuant to DC 7307, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for chronic gastritis with small nodular lesions, and symptoms; a 30 percent evaluation is warranted for chronic gastritis with multiple small eroded or ulcerated areas, and symptoms; and the maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for chronic gastritis with severe hemorrhages, or large ulcerated or eroded areas.

Pursuant to DC 7346, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity; a 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health; and the maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

The terms "severe impairment of health," "persistently recurring" and "considerable impairment of health" are not defined in the rating schedule; rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  However, the Board shall apply the ordinary meanings of the words.  "Considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree."  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267 (11th ed. 2012).  "Persistently recurring" is defined as "continuing to exist despite interference or treatment."  "Recurrent" is defined as "returning or happening time after time."  "Severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful."  Id.  at 1140.

1. From December 9, 2014 to January 25, 2015, entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for a gastrointestinal disability

The Veteran contends that from December 9, 2014 to January 25, 2015, he is entitled to an initial 60 percent rating for his gastrointestinal disability.  See August 2021 Supplemental Claim.  

VA treatment records note the Veteran had gastritis without a hemorrhage.  His GERD was noted to be asymptomatic.  The Veteran was also noted to have a small sliding hiatal hernia.

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record from December 9, 2014 to January 25, 2015 and finds an initial rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted.

A higher initial rating is not warranted as the evidence does not show that from December 9, 2014 to January 25, 2015, the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability resulted in a moderate gastric ulcer with recurring episodes of severe symptoms two to three times per year averaging 10 days in duration; chronic gastritis with multiple small eroded or ulcerated areas or with continuous moderate manifestations; or persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.

Therefore, entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent from December 9, 2014 to January 25, 2015, for a gastrointestinal disability is denied. 

2. From January 26, 2015 to June 28, 2018, entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for a gastrointestinal disability

The Veteran contends that from January 26, 2015 to June 28, 2018, he is entitled to a 60 percent rating for his gastrointestinal disability.  See August 2021 Supplemental Claim.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2015 for esophageal conditions.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran had persistent recurrent epigastric distress; pyrosis; reflux; regurgitation; pain in the substernal, arm, and shoulder; and sleep disturbances caused by esophageal reflux. The examiner indicated the frequency of the Veteran's symptoms was four or more times per year but that the duration of the episodes was less than a day.  

The Veteran also underwent a VA examination in January 2015 for gastrointestinal and duodenal conditions.  The Veteran reported recurrent heartburn, dyspepsia, epigastric burning pain, abdominal discomfort, acid reflux, regurgitation of acids from gastrointestinal, sore throat, and nausea.  He reported these symptoms occurred several times per week.  He also reported that the symptoms are precipitated by certain irritants in meals, and due to the medications he used.  The symptoms were mildly alleviated by taking antacids. The Veteran denied vomiting. The VA examiner noted the Veteran suffered from recurring episodes of symptoms that were not severe.  The symptoms occurred four or more times per year but lasted less than a day.   The Veteran also experienced reoccurring episodes of severe symptoms that occurred four or more times per year and lasted less than a day.  Abdominal pain occurred at least monthly that was pronounced.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination for esophageal conditions in April 2015.  The Veteran reported recurrent episodes of heartburn, dyspnea, epigastric pain and burning sensation, nausea, acid reflux, and episodes of vomiting. The Veteran also reported he took anti-acids with partial relief, and he had modified his diet to avoid irritants.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran had persistently recurrent epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, pain in the substernal, arm, and shoulder, sleep disturbances caused by esophageal reflux that occurred four or more times a year, but lasted less than a day, nausea that occurred four or more times per year, but lasted less than a day, and vomiting that occurred more than four times per year, but lasted less than a day.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination for esophageal conditions in September 2015.  The Veteran reported that his gastrointestinal condition and acid reflux had become progressively worst despite medical treatment.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran had symptoms of persistently recurrent epigastric distress; pyrosis; reflux; regurgitation; substernal pain; sleep disturbance caused by esophageal reflux; nausea; and vomiting.  The frequency of these symptoms was four or more times per year that lasted less than a day. 

A July 2016 VA treatment record noted no anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or blood in the stool. 

A September 2016 VA treatment record noted the Veteran's gastritis was mild and non-erosive. 

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record and finds that from January 26, 2015 to June 28, 2018, a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted.

A higher rating is not warranted as the evidence of record does not show that from January 26, 2015 to June 28, 2018, the Veteran had moderately severe symptoms; less than severe symptoms but with impairment of health manifested by anemia and weight loss; or recurrent incapacitating episodes averaging 10 days or more in duration at least four or more times a year.  The evidence also did not show from January 26, 2015 to June 28, 2018, symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

Therefore, from January 26, 2015 to June 28, 2018, entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for a gastrointestinal disability is denied.

3. From June 29, 2018, entitlement to a rating in excess of 60 percent for a gastrointestinal disability

The Veteran contends that from June 29, 2018, he is entitled to a rating in excess of 60 percent for his gastrointestinal disability.  See August 2021 Supplemental Claim.  

Under DC 7304 for gastric ulcer; 7307 for gastritis; and 7346 for hiatal hernia, the highest rating is 60 percent.  Accordingly, there is no legal basis upon which to award an evaluation in excess of 60 percent under this diagnostic code.  

Concerning referral for an extraschedular rating, neither the Veteran nor his representative have contended, nor does the evidence persuasively reflect, that he has experienced symptoms outside of those contemplated by the rating criteria. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (the Board is not obligated to analyze whether remand for referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted if "§ 3.321(b)(1) [is] neither specifically sought by [the claimant] nor reasonably raised by the facts found by the Board" (quoting Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 499 (2006), aff'd, 226 Fed. Appx. 1004 (Fed. Cir. 2007)).

The Board has considered other applicable rating criteria.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 (which stipulates that disability ratings under Diagnostic Codes 7301 to 7329 inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348 inclusive will not be combined with each other).  However, there is no basis for an additional separate rating. 

Therefore, from June 29, 2018, entitlement to a rating in excess of 60 percent for a gastrointestinal disability is denied.
