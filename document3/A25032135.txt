DATE: April 8, 2025

REMANDED

The issue of whether the character of the Appellant's discharge from service constitutes a bar to the receipt of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Appellant served on active duty with the United States Navy from September 1990 to April 1996; the character of this service is the subject of this appeal.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 higher level review issued by a VA Regional Office (RO) that determined the Appellant's military service does not entitle him to VA benefits.

In February 2024, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  

38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The issue of whether the character of the Appellant's discharge from service constitutes a bar to the receipt of VA benefits is remanded.

The Appellant essentially seeks "veteran" status.  

In this case, the service personnel records associated with the claims file are incomplete, as the AOJ requested only records pertaining to the facts and circumstances of the Appellant's discharge and separation documents.  

The Board additionally notes that the records that have been associated with the record are for the most part illegible and pertain only to service from September 1990 to April 1996 despite December 2022 and January 2023 VA Memorandums indicating service from August 1, 1991, to September 10, 2001, to include in the Southwest Asia theatre of operations.  But see January 2023 Discharge/Retirement or ETS Record (noting only service from 1990 to 1996).  

Failure to obtain the complete service record prior to the promulgation of the decision on appeal constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  Accordingly, a remand is necessary to obtain the entire personnel file, as the Appellant's discharge was the result of sentence by court martial, and any records documenting the misconduct that led to separation are not present in the claims file for the Board's review.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Attempt to obtain any service personnel and treatment records that are not already of record from the appropriate repositories and associate those documents with the claims file.

In doing so, the AOJ should attempt to verify the appellant's service dates.

The AOJ should also attempt to obtain all relevant service records pertaining to the appellant's discharge proceedings, to include any investigations, charge sheets, and trial records.

All such attempts should be documented in the claims file.  If the above-described records are unavailable, the Appellant's file must be documented clearly to that effect and the Appellant notified in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e).
