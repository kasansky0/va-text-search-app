REMANDED

The issue of whether the withholding of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation to recoup disability severance pay in the after-tax amount of $12,343.10 was proper is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from July 1993 to February 1999.  

In May 2023, VA informed the Veteran that, as she received disability severance pay in the amount of $17,143.20 for post-phlebitic syndrome in February 1999, VA was required to withhold from her VA disability compensation as recoupment of the disability severance pay.  In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review: Higher-Level Review, VA Form 20-0996.  On April 2, 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction determined that the withholding of the Veteran's VA disability compensation to recoup disability severance pay in the pre tax amount of $17,143.20 and the after-tax amount of $12,343.10 was proper.  On April 3, 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review Docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction on appeal, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, as the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The issue of whether the withholding of VA disability compensation to recoup disability severance pay in the after-tax amount of $12,343.10 was proper is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that the disability severance pay in the after-tax amount of $12,343.10 that she received in February 1999 has been recouped.

Where the disability or disabilities found to be service connected are the same as those upon which disability severance pay is granted, or where entitlement to disability compensation was established on or after September 15, 1981, an award of compensation will be made subject to recoupment of the disability severance pay.  Where entitlement to disability compensation was established on or after September 15, 1981, a veteran may receive disability compensation for disability incurred or aggravated by service prior to the date of receipt of the severance pay, but VA must recoup from that disability compensation an amount equal to the severance pay.  Where payment of severance pay was made after September 30, 1996, VA will recoup from disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of the severance pay less the amount of Federal income tax withheld from such pay.  38 C.F.R. § 3.700(a)(3).

In December 1998, the Physical Evaluation Board found that the Veteran's "post phlebitic syndrome right lower extremity with edema 2+ from ankle to knee" prevented satisfactory performance of duty in her grade and primary military occupational specialty.  It was noted that the Veteran's disability was neither incurred in line of duty in a combat zone nor incurred during performance of duty in combat-related operations.  The Physical Evaluation Board concluded the "proper disposition to be separation with severance pay."

The February 1999 Report of Separation from the Armed Forces, DD Form 214, states that the Veteran was discharged due to "disability, severance pay."  In February 1999, the Veteran received disability severance pay in the amount of $17,143.20.

On July 7, 1999, VA granted service connection for right leg post phlebitic syndrome; assigned a 20 percent rating for that disability; and effectuated the award as of February 22, 1999.  On July 12, 1999, VA informed the Veteran that "you have received disability severance pay of $17,143.20, of which the after-tax portion of $12,343.10 must be recouped, for your post phlebitic syndrome, right leg" and "we must withhold benefit payments until we recover that full amount."

In May 2023, the Veteran requested an audit.  An October 2023 audit shows a total amount of $3,090.64 recouped from March 1, 1999 to September 8, 1999 and from April 1, 2023 to October 1, 2023.  The audit does not show whether any amount was recouped between September 9, 1999 to March 31, 2023.  That is a pre decisional error.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Conduct a paid and due audit of the Veteran's VA disability compensation benefits for the period from March 1, 1999, to the present.
