ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for seborrheic dermatitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The persuasive weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis was first incurred in service, within a year of service, or was otherwise caused by an in-service event, injury or disease, to include a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a skin disability, to include seborrheic dermatitis, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2000 to September 2005.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO), which was subsequently subject to an October 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR).  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Preliminary Matters

The Board notes that in a February 2025 letter, the Veteran's attorney informed VA that he had withdrawn as the Veteran's legal representative.  However, under 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304 (a), the claimant or his representative has a period of 90 days following receipt of the notice of disagreement, or up to and including the date the appellate decision is promulgated by the Board, whichever comes first, during which they may submit a request for a change in representation.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304 (b), after the expiration of the 90-day period, the Board will not accept a request for a change in representation unless the claimant demonstrates on motion that there was good cause for the delay.

In the instant case, notification was sent to the Veteran on July 25, 2024, that his appeal had been docketed on the Direct review docket.  This July 2024 notice letter advised him of the right to change representation in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304 (a).  The Veteran's attorney did not submit a withdrawal of representation until February 2025, which is after the expiration of the 90-day period.  Therefore, the Board does not recognize the attorney's untimely withdrawal for the skin disability claim on appeal.  In this regard, the Board finds that the untimely February 2025 withdrawal of representation, without an expressed reason for the change, does not constitute good cause.  No correspondence has been received by VA to indicate a reason for the change, thus the attorney's withdrawal from representation is denied and he remains the attorney of record for this docketed appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304 (b).

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

SERVICE CONNECTION

Generally, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

On August 10, 2022, the President signed the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), which therein expanded VA's duty to consider and provide examinations to ascertain connections between disabilities and claimants' participation in known or conceded TERAs unless an exception applies.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1168.

In this case, given the circumstances of his service, it has been determined that the Veteran participated in a non-deployment "garrison" toxic exposure risk activity during active military service in light of his military occupation of "Global Command and Control Systems Common Operational Picture / Maritime Operator" during active military service as reflected by a June 2023 memorandum.  As will be outlined below, in the Veteran's specific case, he indicates he was exposed to firefighting foam in the context of his duties.

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether discussed in detail.  See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal).  To the extent the evidence is found in "approximate balance," the Board will afford the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed, Cir. 2021) (holding that exact equipoise is not required for the benefit of the doubt to be applied, but rather the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal").

Entitlement to service connection for seborrheic dermatitis is denied.

It is not reasonably in dispute that the Veteran has a diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis and that he participated in a TERA. 

The Veteran's service treatment records do not reflect treatment for or complaints of a skin disease or symptoms of a skin disease, and his May 2005 medical assessment upon separation from service is normal with the exception of PRK surgery.

Again, the Veteran's DD-214 indicates that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was as a Global Command and Control System, Common Operational Picture/Maritime Operator and, therefore, VA conceded his general exposure to TERA and, in particular, that he would have come into contact with firefighting foam. Even so, there is nothing in his military records, however, to suggest he ever had a skin related reaction during service to any such TERA. 

June 2022 post-treatment records, over fifteen years after service, private treatment records indicate that the Veteran was treated for seborrheic dermatitis on his ears, while July 2022 records reflect cellulitis of the scalp and a left posterior scalp rash with onset 2 weeks prior.

In an August 2023 disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) the examining physician assistant (PA) opined that the Veteran's skin disease was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the Veteran's TERA.  The PA noted that the Veteran reported exposure to firefighting foam (AFFF) and that while he has a diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis, there is insufficient literature connecting AFFF to seborrheic dermatitis, therefore a nexus cannot be formed.  The DBQ indicated that there were no visible characteristic lesions of seborrheic dermatitis, and that the Veteran reported noticing red, painful bumps on his scalp in 2021 which he managed on his own until 2022.  He sought treatment as the condition worsened and was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis which progressed to his ears.  He denied symptoms at the time of the examination.

Based on the entirety of the evidentiary record, the Board finds the persuasive weight of the evidence is against a finding of entitlement to service connection for seborrheic dermatitis.  There is no persuasive indication that the condition began in service or for many years after service nor has the condition been persuasively linked to any incident in service, to include his known participation in a TERA.  Indeed, there is persuasive evidence to the contrary. The August 2023 PA opined that the Veteran's skin disease was less likely than not related to service.  The PA provided a thorough rationale to support her opinion based on an accurate characterization of the evidence of record, including consideration of the Veteran's medical history and all pertinent findings, such that the Board is able to make a fully informed decision.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).  The August 2023 DBQ is thus considered adequate for adjudication of the Veteran's service connection claim and is afforded significant probative value.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  There are no contrary medical opinions in the evidence of record as to the etiology of the Veteran's skin disease.

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any treatment for skin disease or symptoms of a skin disease, and his May 2005 discharge medical assessment does not reflect any skin diseases.  There is no evidence of skin disability issues for several years following service as noted in the June 2022 post-service treatment records wherein the Veteran indicated that he developed a rash 2 weeks prior to treatment.  The Board finds as a fact in this case that the medical evidence of record is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran suffered from a skin disease in service that continues to the present.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that his skin disability is due to an in-service event, namely exposure to AFFF.  While the Veteran is competent to provide testimony or statements relating to symptoms or facts of events that he has observed and are within the realm of his personal knowledge, he is not competent to establish that which would require specialized knowledge or training, such as medical expertise.  The record does not show, nor does the Veteran contend, that he has specialized education, training, or experience that would qualify him to render a diagnosis or render a medical opinion on this matter.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), the issue in this case is outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person because it involves a complex medical issue that goes beyond a simple and immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n. 4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Thus, the Veteran's statements in this regard are not competent and are afforded no probative weight.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so regarding whether service connection for a skin disability is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against service connection for skin disability.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
