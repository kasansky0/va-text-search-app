ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, her back disability is at least as likely as not related to service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a back disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1999 to January 2009 with additional years of Reserve service. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in March 2024.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability.

The Veteran contends her current back disability is due to active service.  

Specifically, she contends the marches and hospital work for many years injured her back.  See February 2021 Fully Developed Claim.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.  VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.  Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1395 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Initially, under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  In the March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ found the following favorable findings: 

"	The Veteran has been diagnosed with a current back disability.  She has been diagnosed with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease of the spine with medical records noting treatment for back pain since 2018. 

"	There are credible lay statements of record that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of military duties as a medical technician. 

"	The claimed disability of arthritis is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to military service. 

"	The Veteran has sufficient service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309. 

Therefore, the Board will not overturn these favorable findings of fact.  

The Veteran was provided with a VA medical opinion for her back in May 2022.  The examiner opined the claimed back disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the daily job in the military, carrying heavy loads, working on the feet for 12 or more hours, working EMS, and lifting heavy patients during service.  A review of the claims file shows the Veteran was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and degenerative arthritis of the spine in April 2022.  However, further review of the claims file is relatively silent for documented, chronic complaints of low back conditions causing pain or limited range of motion while on active duty.  The examiner also noted the Veteran's yearly physicals from 1999, 2008, and 2017 are negative for reports of low back pain or injury.

The May 2022 VA examination opinion largely relies on the lack of documented or chronic complaints of a low back condition causing pain or limited range of motion while on active duty.  The opinion states the claims file is relatively silent but that does not mean there are no symptoms.  It implies the symptoms might be less noticeable or less severe.  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current back disability is related to service.  With a current back disability and credible lay statements of record that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had onset during service, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that service connection for a back disability is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
