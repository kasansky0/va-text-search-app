ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for service connection for rhinitis is denied.

The freestanding claim for an earlier effective date prior to August 5, 2021 for service connection for sinusitis is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was awarded service connection for rhinitis on a presumptive basis under the PACT act.

2. The Veteran was not diagnosed with rhinitis within 10 years of qualifying service.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that rhinitis began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease, including Gulf War environmental exposure.

4. The Veteran's appeal for an effective date prior to August 5, 2021 for the award of service connection for sinusitis constitutes an impermissible freestanding claim for an earlier effective date.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for service connection for rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.114, 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 5, 2021 for service connection for sinusitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105, 19.55, 20.203; see also Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from December 1990 to May 1991, and from January 1996 to June 1997. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of the April 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 RO decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with regard to the duty to notify or duty to assist as they pertain to the issues considered in this decision. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361  (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The analysis in this decision focuses on the most relevant evidence and on what the evidence shows or does not show with respect to the issues denied in this decision. The Veteran should not assume that evidence that is not explicitly discussed in this decision has been overlooked. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (noting that the law requires only that reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant be addressed).

EFFECTIVE DATES

The effective date based on the submission of new and material evidence received after a final disallowance is the date of the receipt of the new claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.40(q)(2) (previously 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(1)(ii)), 3.400(r). The effective date for the grant of service connection following a final decision is the date of the reopened claim. See Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 248 (2002) (holding that 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) "is clear on its face with respect to granting an effective date for an award of VA periodic monetary benefits no earlier than the date that the claim for reopening was filed").

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) explained that the statutory framework does not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits based on a reopened claim. Id. (holding that the term "new claim," as it appeared in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q), means a claim to reopen a previously and finally decided claim).

Regulations that were in effect prior to March 24, 2015, required that an informal claim "must identify the benefit sought." See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160. The regulations also provided that a claim may be either a formal or informal written communication "requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). The regulations in effect since March 24, 2015, do not allow for informal claims that are not submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160. The Board will apply the regulations in effect prior to March 24, 2015, for all communications received prior to March 24, 2015.	

Thus, the essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009). VA must look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as applications or claims, formal and informal, for benefits and is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits. Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992). However, VA is not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155). The amendments apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

A specific claim in the form prescribed by VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a) (previously 38 U.S.C. § 3001(a)); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application, therefore. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) (previously 38 U.S.C. § 3010(a)). The effective date for an award of service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date is the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement to service connection arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Further, under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). For decisions rendered after a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182. Id. For supplemental claims received more than one year after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

A claimant may withdraw a supplemental claim or a request for a higher-level review at any time before VA renders a decision on the issue. A claimant must submit in writing or through electronic submission in a manner prescribed by the Secretary any notice of withdrawal of an issue under the selected review option to the agency of original jurisdiction. The withdrawal will be effective the date VA receives it. A claimant may withdraw an appeal to the Board of Veteran's Appeals as prescribed in § 20.205. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(d)

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must be against the claim. Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for service connection for rhinitis 

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 5, 2021 for service connection for sinusitis 

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for his service-connected rhinitis. He seeks an effective date in 2000, when he filed for disabilities. See April 2024 Notice of Disagreement. The Veteran is appealing an October 2018 rating decision that denied service connection for sinusitis. Id. The Veteran asserts that he should receive an effective dated back to 2000, when he originally filed for disability. Id.

In April 2017, the Veteran filed a claim for sinusitis, and rhinitis. In the August 2017 rating decision, the Veteran's claim for sinusitis (claimed as rhinitis) was denied, as it was determined that the condition was not directly related to service. In April 2018, the Veteran filed another claim for sinusitis (claimed as rhinitis). In the October 2018 rating decision, the Veteran's claim continued to be denied, as the condition as the condition was not related to or aggravated by service. In July 2019, the Veteran filed a claim for rhinitis and a claim for sinusitis. 

In August 2021, the Veteran filed an intent to file form. In August 2021, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim for chronic sinusitis and rhinitis. In August 2021, the Veteran submitted a statement in support of claim that he has had chronic sinusitis, deviated septum, and allergic rhinitis with polyps since service, and wanted to file his claim under the presumption of exposure to fine particular matter. 

In October 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination that noted that the Veteran had a diagnosis of sinusitis (2008) and rhinitis (2009). In the October 2021 rating decision, the Veteran's claims for entitlement to service connection for sinusitis and rhinitis continued to be denied. The Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for rhinitis and sinusitis were denied because the Veteran was not diagnosed with sinusitis until 2008 and rhinitis until 2009, which was more than 10 years since he separated from service. In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a correspondence indicating that he was diagnosed within 10 years of his retirement in 2015. In March 2022, the Veteran filed a higher-level review form for sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. In the higher-level review, the Veteran claimed that he was diagnosed with the conditions in 1998, which is within 10 years of service. 

In the April 2022 rating decision, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for sinusitis was granted with an effective date of August 5, 2021, as he was granted service connection based on presumption for exposure to particulate matter. The RO found the prior denial was clearly and unmistakably erroneous, as the Veteran was treated for sinusitis in 1996, and was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis in June 2007 and November 2008. The RO explained that an effective date of August 5, 2021 was assigned for the granting of service connection for sinusitis, date of change in law which allows for presumptive service connection for sinusitis as being due to exposure to particulate matter, as the Veteran's Intent to File and supplemental claim was received within 1 year of the law change and he met all eligibility criteria from the date of the change in law. The Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for rhinitis continued to be denied because he was not diagnosed with rhinitis within 10 years of qualifying service. The first treatment noted for rhinitis occurred in October 2009.

In June 2022, the Veteran submitted a claim for rhinitis. In June 2022, the Veteran submitted a correspondence that discussed his sinusitis, and noted his sinusitis worsened, and created blockages of his nasal passages and sinus cavities due to inflammation of polyps. In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim form, and a copy of the prior correspondence. In the February 2023 rating decision, the Veteran's claim for entitlement for service-connected continued to be denied. In February 2023 the Veteran submitted a request for a higher-level review, and noted that the Pact Act should have been awarded for his rhinitis. In March 2023, the Veteran submitted another request for a higher-level review, and noted that the PACT Act should have been awarded, and his condition has worsened, and now requires him to seek care. In the June 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for rhinitis with an effective date of August 10, 2022. 

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a new claim for an increased disability rating for sinusitis. In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim for an increased disability rating for rhinitis. In the March 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was granted an increased disability rating of 10 percent for his sinusitis and rhinitis, effective November 15, 2023. In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement appealing the effective date of service connection for rhinitis from the April 2024 rating decision, and the effective date of service connection from the October 2018 rating decision.

Rhinitis

Legal Criteria for Presumptions

Effective August 5, 2021, VA amended its regulations to permit service connection on a presumptive basis for asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis, to include rhinosinusitis, due to presumed exposure to fine, particulate matter even though there is no evidence of such a disease during service provided that the disease manifests to any degree (including to a non-compensable degree) within 10 years from the date of separate from service that includes a qualifying period of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320; see also 86 Fed. Reg. 42724 (Aug. 5, 2021). However, these disabilities may not be seasonal or an acute allergic manifestation in nature. 86 Fed. Reg. 42724 (Aug. 5, 2021); 38 C.F.R. § 3.380.

The phrase "qualifying period of service" means active service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, to include the Red Sea, during the Persian Gulf War as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2(i). 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(4). A veteran with a qualifying period of service shall be presumed to have been exposed to fine, particulate matter during such service absent affirmative evidence establishing that they were not exposed to fine, particulate matter during that service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(3).

Thereafter, the PACT Act established chronic rhinitis as a presumptive disease associated with exposure to burn pits and other toxins diagnosed after service without the need for the manifestation of the disorder within 10 years after service, as had been provided in the earlier law. See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No.117-168, § 406(b) (2022). See 38 USCS § 1120. However, grants of presumptive service connection under the PACT Act may not be effective prior August 10, 2022, the date the PACT Act was signed into law. See Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. at 1759 (Aug. 10, 2022); Decision Memorandum: Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) of 2022 Implementation Elimination of Phased-In Applicability Dates (approved Sept. 30, 2022).

The Board finds that a disability rating prior to August 10, 2022 for entitlement to service connection for rhinitis is not warranted. In the June 2023 rating decision, the Veteran's rhinitis was granted service connection, effective August 10, 2022, based on the PACT Act. As noted, grants of presumptive service connection under the PACT Act may not be effective prior August 10, 2022, the date the PACT Act was signed into law.

Prior to the PACT Act, effective August 5, 2021, VA amended its regulations to permit service connection on a presumptive basis for asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis, to include rhinosinusitis, due to presumed exposure to fine, particulate matter even though there is no evidence of such a disease during service provided that the disease manifests to any degree (including to a non-compensable degree) within 10 years from the date of separate from service that includes a qualifying period of service. Here, the Veteran's rhinitis was not diagnosed with rhinitis until October 2009, which is more than 10 years after the Veteran's qualifying service. The Veteran contends that he retired in 2015, and that he meets the 10-year criteria. The Board notes that in order for the service to be qualifying means active service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, to include the Red Sea, during the Persian Gulf War. The Veteran may have worked as a contractor in Iraq subsequent to service, but his last qualifying service (active duty) occurred in June 1997. Thus, the Veteran was not diagnosed within 10 years of qualifying service, and does not meet the criteria under presumption for fine particular matter.

Lastly, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for rhinitis could not be awarded on a direct basis. Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The Veteran's service treatment records were silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of rhinitis. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran had complaints of sinusitis, but not rhinitis during service.

In August 2017, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for sinusitis, rhinitis and other conditions of the nose, throat, larynx, and pharynx conditions. The examiner noted that the Veteran has a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, since at least 2010. The examiner opined that the Veteran's rhinitis was less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) related to his active military service. As to the rationale, the examiner explained that allergic rhinitis is triggered by seasonal plants, trees, grass and less likely than not (less than 50% probability) incurred by or caused by or hastened or worsened by Gulf War environmental exposure. The examiner also noted that the Veteran's sinus diseases were more likely caused by the narrowing of the ostiomeatal complex unit, bacterial/viral infection, allergies, deviated nasal septum, & history of tobacco use. 

The Board finds that service connection is not warranted on a direct basis because the Veteran's service treatment records were absent of a rhinitis disability during the Veteran's active military service. In addition, the Veteran was not diagnosed with rhinitis until October 2009, which demonstrates that the Veteran has not had chronicity of rhinitis symptoms since service. Finally, the August 2017 VA examiner determined that the Veteran's rhinitis was less likely than not related to his active military service including Gulf War environmental exposure. The Board finds the August 2017 to be the most probative evidence as it includes clear conclusions and supporting data with a reasoned analysis connecting the data and conclusions. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

The Board finds that an earlier effective date prior to August 10, 2022 is not warranted. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran contends that he should have been granted an earlier effective date of when he filed his claim. However, the probative evidence is against finding that the Veteran's rhinitis was directly related to his active military service. The Board also considered whether the Veteran could be granted an earlier effective date as of August 5, 2021 under the presumption of fine particular matter, however the Veteran was not diagnosed with rhinitis within 10 years of qualifying service (active duty). Thus, the Board finds that an effective date of August 5, 2021, under the PACT Act presumptions, is the earliest possible effective date for an award of service connection for rhinitis. 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal in the veteran's favor, the claim must be denied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

In this case, the Board does not find that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, as the Veteran was awarded service connection for rhinitis on a presumptive basis under the PACT act. The Veteran was not diagnosed with rhinitis within 10 years of qualifying service. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that rhinitis began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease, including Gulf War environmental exposure.

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 5, 2021 for service connection for sinusitis 

The Veteran is appealing an October 2018 rating decision that denied service connection for sinusitis. The Veteran asserts that he should receive an effective dated back to 2000, when he originally filed for disability. See April 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

Freestanding Claims for Earlier Effective Dates

A rating decision granting service connection and assigning an effective date becomes final if the Veteran does not timely perfect an appeal of the decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. Previous determinations that are final and binding, including decisions of service connection, degree of disability, age, marriage, relationship, service, dependency, line of duty, and other issues will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.

In Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299-300 (2006), it was held that once a rating decision that establishes an effective date for a grant of service connection becomes final, the only way that such a decision can be revised is if it contains CUE. The Court noted that any other result would vitiate the rule of finality. In other words, the Court found that there is no valid freestanding claim for an earlier effective date. The Court held that if a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date is raised, an appeal in the matter should be dismissed.

To find CUE in a prior adjudication, it must be determined (1) that either the correct facts known at the time or constructively known at the time were not before the adjudicator or the law then in effect was incorrectly applied, (2) that an error occurred based on the record and the law that existed at the time the prior decision was made, and (3) had the error not been made, the outcome would have been manifestly different. Bouton v. Peake, 23 Vet. App. 70, 71 (2008); Grover v. West, 12 Vet. App. 109, 112 (1999).

In the April 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for sinusitis, and assigned a 0 percent disability rating, effective August 5, 2021. The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement or submit new and relevant evidence within one year of issuance of the April 2022 rating decision. The rating decision therefore became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 20.302, 20.1103.

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that there can be no freestanding claim for an earlier effective date, and that once an effective date has become final (by way of an AOJ or Board decision), a claimant's only recourse is to have the final decision revised on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error. See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006); 38 U.S.C. § 7111; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1400 to 1404. When such a freestanding claim is raised, such an appeal must be dismissed. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299-300.

This issue does not come before the Board as a motion to revise the prior final April 2022 rating decision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error. The Board also notes that the only rating decision regarding sinusitis, that is within a year of the April 2024 Notice of Disagreement, is the March 2024 rating decision that granted an increased disability rating of 10 percent for the service-connected sinusitis disability, effective November 15, 2023. The Veteran did not appeal the increased disability rating, but instead appealed the effective date of service connection, within the April 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

As noted above, the Veteran is appealing an October 2018 rating decision which denied the Veteran service connection for sinusitis, in the April 2024 Notice of Disagreement. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.203, 

A claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. The date of mailing the letter of notification of the decision will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed.

Here, the Veteran appealed the October 2018 rating decision which is more than a year prior to the April 2024 rating decision, which is impermissible. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that he should receive an effective date, back to the 2000's. 

However, the Veteran did not appeal the April 2022 rating decision that granted service connection for sinusitis or submit new and relevant evidence within one year of issuance of the April 2022 rating decision, and thus the decision became final. As such, the issue constitutes an impermissible freestanding claim for an earlier effective date. Therefore, the Veteran's appeal for an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for the service-connected sinusitis must be dismissed. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299-300; 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
