CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a low back disability, to include degenerative disc disease, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1985 to October 1989.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issues of entitlement to service connection for a low back disability, service connection for hypertension, and service connection for diabetes mellitus, most recently addressed in November 2022 rating decisions.  In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

With respect to the service connection claim for hypertension and service connection for diabetes mellitus type II, the Board observes that the Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim in February 2025 seeking readjudication of these issues.  In this case, the Veteran did not withdraw the June 2024 VA Form 10182 from which the current appeal stems.  Accordingly, the February 2025 Supplemental Claim constitutes a concurrent election that is prohibited under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for hypertension and service connection for diabetes mellitus, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).       

Low Back Disability

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.   As it pertains to this appeal, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a period of war or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities are presumed to have been incurred in service if manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  When a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing a continuity of symptomatology after service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  The use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited only to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In relevant part, the Veteran reported that his current low back condition is related to airborne operations and the physical requirements of military activities.  See September 2008 VA Form 21-4138.  Additionally, the Veteran reported that he sought treatment for an in-service back injury in 1989.  He indicated that he continued to experience low back symptoms, but was unable to afford private treatment for his back condition following separation from service.

Here, service personnel records document that the Veteran's military operation specialty was Aviation Operation Specialist.  See DD Form 214.  In addition, service personnel records confirm that he completed airborne training and earned a Parachute Badge.  Regarding the Veteran's report of injuring his back in 1989, service treatment records show that he sought treatment for low back pain for one week in August 1989.  The Veteran reported that he started experiencing low back pain immediately after lifting heavy equipment.  A September 1989 Wellness Check associated with service treatment records noted that the Veteran continued to experience back pains.  

In an October 2008 VA joints examination. the Veteran reported that he continued to experience back pain following his separation from service, which he treated with over-the-counter medications.  See also February 2022 VA back examination (Veteran reported that symptoms of his current back condition had onset in service).  Diagnostic imaging of the Veteran's back revealed degenerative changes involving the thoracic and lumbar spine.  See also February 2022 VA back examination (noting that diagnostic imaging revealed degenerative disc disease); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.309.   While not pertaining specifically to the Veteran's service connection claim for a back disability, a VA medical opinion obtained in September 2016 stated that medical literature supports the occurrence of back injuries during parachuting activities.

In this particular case, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran in finding that entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is warranted.  The Veteran is competent to report facts and circumstances that can be observed and described by a lay person.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  Here, service treatment records reflect the Veteran sought treatment for low back pain in service, and the Board finds that the Veteran's report of continued back symptoms after separation from service to be credible.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (while the lack of contemporaneous medical records may be considered and weighed against lay evidence, the lack of such records does not, in and of itself, render lay evidence not credible).  The Veteran indicated that he self-treated his continued low back symptoms with over-the-counter medication.  See Walker, 708 F.3d at 1339-40.  In reaching the decision herein, the Board assigns weight to the September 2016 medical opinion to the extent that the examiner cited to medical literature supporting the occurrence of back injuries due to parachuting activities.  

Accordingly, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran in finding that entitlement to service connection for a low back disability, to include degenerative disc disease, is warranted, and the appeal is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus 

In this case, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hypertension that appears to have been first diagnosed in 2007.  See February 2022 VA hypertension examination.  Additionally, he has a current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type II that appears to have been first diagnosed in 2015.  See January 2015 VA note.  The Veteran asserts that his current diagnoses of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II are a result of obesity caused by his inability to maintain an exercise routine due to service-connected disabilities, including his right ankle disability and his bilateral knee disability.  See November 2021 VA Form 20-0995 with associated correspondence.

While obesity is not a disability for which compensation may be awarded, obesity can constitute an "intermediate step" in demonstrating service connection on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) for another condition.  See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury is service connected.  The following issues must be resolved in determining whether obesity can qualify as an intermediate step for secondary service connection: (1) whether the service-connected disability caused the veteran to become obese; (2) if so, whether the obesity as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing the claimed secondary disability; and (3) whether the claimed secondary disability would not have occurred but for obesity caused by the service-connected disability.  See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 303-4 (2020).  

In Walsh, the Court determined that obesity may also be an "intermediate step" in a secondary-service-connection analysis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) when service-connected disability aggravates obesity.  See Walsh, 32 Vet. App. at 306-7.  Under this inquiry, the following issues must be resolved in determining whether obesity can qualify as an intermediate step for secondary service connection: (1) whether the service-connected disability aggravated the veteran's obesity; (2) if so, whether the aggravation of obesity as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing the claimed secondary disability; and (3) whether the claimed secondary disability would not have occurred but for obesity aggravated by the service-connected disability.

In August 2022, the Veteran submitted private medical opinion(s) from Physician Assistant M.B. regarding service connection for hypertension and diabetes.  Additionally, in February 2023, the Veteran submitted private medical opinion(s) from Registered Nurse P.D. regarding service connection for hypertension and diabetes.  Both M.B. and P.D. opined that the Veteran's diagnosis of hypertension and his diagnosis of diabetes was "secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by" his service-connected disabilities with associated weight gain.  While the private medical opinions cited to medical literature, the studies discuss generalized associations between obesity and hypertension, and obesity and diabetes.  The Board finds that the private medical opinions are not supported with a well-reasoned medical explanation specific to the Veteran in this appeal.  See May 2023 VA medical opinion (noting that obesity is one of many risk factors that cause hypertension and/or diabetes); see also Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (the probative value of a medical opinion comes from when it is factually accurate, fully articulated, and sound reasoning for the conclusion).   

The AOJ obtained VA medical opinions in May 2023 to address whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities caused hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus type II, with obesity as an intermediate step.  The examiner stated that, while physical activities play a role in becoming obese, obesity is primarily due to dietary habits and consumption of extra calories.  However, the examiner did not address whether the Veteran's obesity may be an "intermediate step" in a secondary-service-connection analysis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) when service-connected disability aggravates obesity.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (once VA undertakes providing a claimant with a medical examination, it has a duty to ensure the examination is adequate).   

In light of the above, the Board finds that the medical evidence of record prior to issuing the August 2023 decision on appeal is not adequate for adjudicating the Veteran's service connection claims for hypertension and diabetes mellitus.  The Board finds that remand is required to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a medical opinion addressing the Veteran's service connection claim for hypertension and his service connection claim for diabetes mellitus type II.  If an opinion cannot be provided without a VA examination, the Veteran should be schedule for a new examination. Following a review of the record, and if necessary, a new VA examination, the examiner is asked to respond to the following:

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that (1) the service-connected disability or disabilities caused the veteran to become obese; (2) if so, was the obesity as a result of the service-connected disability or disabilities a substantial factor in causing hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus type II; and (3) would hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus type II not have occurred but for obesity caused by the service-connected disability or disabilities?

A complete medical rationale for all opinions expressed must be provided.

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that (1) the service-connected disability or disabilities aggravated the veteran's obesity; (2) if so, was the aggravation of obesity as a result of the service-connected disability or disabilities a substantial factor in causing hypertension and/or diabetes; and (3) would hypertension and/or diabetes not have occurred but for obesity aggravated by the service-connected disability or disabilities?

A complete medical rationale for all opinions expressed must be provided.
