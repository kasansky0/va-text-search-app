ORDER

Entitlement to a rating greater than 20 percent for left knee instability is denied.

Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for left knee limitation of flexion is denied.

Entitlement to a separate 10 percent rating for a left knee meniscal condition is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left knee has not been manifested by severe instability, an unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear, or a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex.

2. The Veteran's left knee has not been manifested by flexion limited to 30 degrees or extension limited to 10 degrees.

3. The Veteran's meniscal condition has resulted in symptoms distinct from limited motion and instability. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a rating greater than 20 percent for left knee instability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a Diagnostic Code 5257.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for left knee limitation of flexion have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a Diagnostic Code 5260-61.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a separate 10 percent rating for a left knee meniscal condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a Diagnostic Codes 5258-59.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1997 to September 2005.  He appeals an April 2023 rating decision denying increased ratings for left knee limitation of motion and instability.  He opted for direct review of the evidence by this Board. 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations.  See generally, Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991); 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection is required.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 199, 125-26 (1999).  Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Further, "[w]here there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned."  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

A disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance. Functional loss may be due to the absence or deformity of structures or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior in undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.40.  With respect to joints, the factors of disability reside in reductions of normal excursion of movements in different planes.  Inquiry will be directed to more or less than normal movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, deformity or atrophy of disuse.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45.  Although pain may cause functional loss, pain itself does not constitute functional loss.  Rather, pain must affect some aspect of "the normal working movements of the body," such as "excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," in order to constitute functional loss.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 38-43 (2011) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40); see also DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206-207 (1995).

Specifically, consideration must be given to the impact on range of motion from flare-ups and pain on both active and passive motion in weight-bearing and non-weight bearing.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011), Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), and Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).

During the course of this appeal, the schedular criteria for evaluating the knee have been amended.  Relevant to this case, the criteria pertaining to knee instability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5257, was amended effective February 7, 2021.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (November 30, 2020).  Ratings based on limitation of motion and semilunar cartilage dysfunction remained unchanged.

Where a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a claim for increased rating, the Board should first determine whether application of the revised version would produce retroactive results.  In particular, a new rule may not extinguish any rights or benefits the claimant had prior to enactment of the new rule. VAOPGCPREC 07-03 (November 19, 2003).

However, if the revised version is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308, 313 (1991), overruled in part, Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  As the Veteran's claim was received prior to the effective date of the regulation changes, the Board must consider the Veteran's right knee disability under both the old and the revised rating criteria and must apply the old rating criteria if the result is more favorable to the Veteran.  Id.

1. Entitlement to a rating greater than 20 percent for left knee instability.

2. Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for left knee limitation of flexion.

The Veteran seeks a separate rating for a left knee meniscal condition.  After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that a separate rating is not warranted.

From the outset, the Board acknowledges that separate ratings may be assigned for limitation of flexion, extension, instability, and a meniscal disability of the same knee under Diagnostic Codes 5260, 5261, 5257, 5258 or 5259.  See VAOPGCPRECs 9-04, 9-98, 23-97; Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017).  Review of the medical evidence does not reveal ankylosis, impairment of the tibia or fibula, or genu recurvatum at any time during the period on appeal.  Thus, disability ratings are not available under Diagnostic Codes 5256, or 5262-63.

Here, the Veteran is already in receipt of a 10 percent rating for left knee limitation of flexion and a 20 percent rating for left knee instability.  He does not argue, nor does the evidence show, that higher ratings are warranted for these two conditions.  

Limitation of motion

To warrant increased ratings under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, the evidence must show: 

"	Flexion limited to 30 degrees (20 percent); or

"	Extension limited to 10 degrees (10 percent). 

Normal range of motion of the knee is from zero degrees of extension to 140 degrees of flexion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.  For VA compensation purposes, ankylosis is described as a condition in which the entire joint is fixed in flexion or extension.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, note 5. 

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran was afforded VA examinations in August and November 2021.  At each examination, the Veteran's left knee range of motion measured at least 100 degrees flexion with full extension under all test conditions.  His reported symptoms were limited to pain and "locking".  Frequent effusion was not noted and no additional factors contributing to disability were found.  

Notably, the Veteran's statements have been limited to a separate rating for a meniscal condition.  He has not made statements indicating his left knee limitation of motion is worse than the rating he currently receives.  Thus, based on the medical and lay evidence, a higher rating is not warranted for left knee limitation of motion.

Instability

To warrant a higher rating than 20 percent under the amended criteria, the evidence must show: recurrent subluxation or instability manifested by unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation (30 percent); or patellar instability manifested by a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker (30 percent).  Under the pre-amended criteria, instability of the knee was based on undefined levels of instability evaluated as 30 percent for "severe"; 20 percent for "moderate"; and 10 percent for "slight".  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257 (prior to Feb. 7, 2021).

In essence, the undefined terms are used to provide a general description of the intensity or degree of the rated condition.  Because the terms severe, "slight", "moderate", and "severe", are undefined in the rating schedule, rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are equitable and just.  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  A more precise method of evaluating the conditions is unavailable and not contemplated by the applicable rating criteria.

At his August 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported weekly flare-ups of pain that that decreased his ability to stand or walk for prolonged periods.  He also reported a history of giving way/buckling of the left knee.  A history of recurrent subluxation or instability was noted, though a history of frequent "locking" and effusion was not.  Unfortunately, the examiner did not properly account for the effects of the Veteran's meniscal condition when completing the examination report, necessitating another VA examination.

In November 2021, the Veteran reported at a subsequent VA examination that he was informed by a private provider that he had a loose ligament in his left knee.  Overtime, his left knee continued to give out and one day the knee buckled on him, and he tore his meniscus.  The Veteran reported continued achy left knee pain for which he wears a brace.  He has to wear the brace most of the time otherwise the left knee will buckle and give out.  The examiner denied the existence recurrent patellar instability but noted recurrent subluxation or peristent instability due to partial ligament tear.  Although frequent episodes of joint pain and "locking" was noted, frequent episodes of effusion was again denied.

Overall, the evidence does not show that a higher rating is warranted for left knee instability.  For the brief period on appeal prior to February 2021, the evidence does not show severe instability.  For example, the Veteran has not reported chronic falling and indicates that his knee does not always give out without a brace.  In addition, a patellar condition has not been identified and the presence of frequent episodes of effusion has been consistently denied.  Accordingly, the next higher 30 percent rating is not warranted.

Semilunar Cartilage (Meniscus)

The Veteran's argument is confined to a separate rating for a meniscal condition.  In support of his claim, he points to VA's acknowledgement in the April 2023 rating decision that he would meet the criteria for DC 5259, except the issue is rated analogous to a disability in which not only the functions affected, but anatomical localization and symptoms, are closely related (38 CFR § 4.20, DC 5257).  The Veteran correctly notes that 38 CFR § 4.20 applies to analogous ratings for "unlisted conditions".  That is not the case here, as the Veteran's meniscal condition is contemplated by the Rating Schedule.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a DCs 5258-59.  However, 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 does apply.  

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as "pyramiding", is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  The critical element is that none of the symptomatology for a condition is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of another condition.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261 (1994).  In this case, a separate rating for the Veteran's left meniscus condition is available only if it does not result in impermissible pyramiding.  As his rating under DC 5260 compensates for limited motion due to pain, and his rating under DC 5257 compensates for instability due to locking and giving way, the record must show evidence of symptoms distinct from those already compensated.  

The Veteran reported during a September 2017 surgery consult that his left knee swelled "on occasion".  The Board finds this does not meet the requirement of frequent episodes of effusion into the joint under DC 5258.  Indeed, a history of frequent effusion of the joint was not found by the November 2021 VA examiner.  Also of note, the Veteran's argument is limited to a separate rating under DC 5259, with no mention to entitlement under DC 5228.  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a separate 20 percent rating for a left knee meniscal condition is not warranted.  

The Veteran also points to other occasions where he reported swelling of the knee, showing a continuity of symptoms over time.  The Board finds that the effusion into the joint is, to a large extent, separate and distinct from the painful motion and instability that forms the basis for the Veteran's other compensable ratings for the left knee.  Therefore, an additional compensable rating under DC 5259 is allowable without pyramiding.  

In reaching its decision, the Board has considered the Veteran's statements that his left knee meniscal condition warrants a separate rating.  In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).

Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  While the Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses, such as pain and stiffness, he is not competent to identify a specific level of disability according to the appropriate diagnostic codes.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  On the other hand, such competent evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's left knee disability have been provided by the medical examiners who examined him during the current appeal.

In conclusion, while higher ratings are not warranted for left knee limitation of motion or instability, a separate 10 percent rating for a meniscal condition is warranted.  To that extent, the claim is granted.
