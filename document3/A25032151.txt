CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for right lower extremity shin splints, claimed as due to Anthrax/Ciprofloxacin treatment are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for left lower extremity shin splints, claimed as due to Anthrax/Ciprofloxacin treatment are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis, claimed as secondary to pes planus are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States from April 1996 to March 2000.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In an April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal. The Veteran included the issue of the right pinky toe in the VA Form 10182. However, the March 2024 rating decision deferred the issue for further development and a decision was not rendered in this rating decision. As such, this issue is not properly before the Board for adjudication.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider in this decision, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision.

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this Decision, there is no requirement that every piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail. Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim. See Gonzales v. West,?218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81?(Fed. Cir. 2000); Timberlake v. Gober,?14?Vet. App.?122, 128-130?(2000). 

Legal Criteria 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

Analysis - Shin Splints

The Veteran asserts that entitlement to service connection for shin splints of the lower extremities is warranted because the claimed disabilities are due to service. More specifically, the Veteran contends the claimed disabilities are related to an in-service anthrax vaccine.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of shin splints of the left lower extremity nor the right lower extremity and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The May 2023 VA examination indicated that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of shin splints. There is no medical evidence of record documenting a diagnosis of shin splints.

While the Veteran sincerely believes there is a current diagnosis of shin splints of the left lower extremity and right lower extremity, in the Board's view, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. Because the condition requires interpretation of diagnostic testing and an understanding of body systems, which requires specialized medical education and training, the Board believes the issue is medically complex. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 & n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence. The appeal is denied.

Analysis - Plantar Fasciitis

The Veteran asserts that service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis is warranted because the claimed disability is the result of pes planus.  

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral plantar fasciitis and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The March 2024 VA examination noted that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. There is no medical evidence of record documenting a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis.

While the Veteran sincerely believes there is a current diagnosis of bilateral plantar fasciitis, in the Board's view, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. Because the condition requires interpretation of diagnostic testing and an understanding of body systems, which requires specialized medical education and training, the Board believes the issue is medically complex. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 & n.4. Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence. The appeal is denied.
