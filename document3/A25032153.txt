ORDER

Service connection for fibromyalgia is denied. 

A compensable disability rating for allergic rhinitis is denied. 

A disability rating higher than 10 percent for a residual scar over the left inner thigh for an excised cyst is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The weight of the probative evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed fibromyalgia associated with any aspect of the Veteran's service, to include his service in Southwest Theater of Operations during the Persian Gulf War. 

2. The evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran's service-connected allergic?rhinitis?has been shown to result in greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side and nasal polyps. 

3. The Veteran has not submitted evidence of good cause for his failure to report for a September 2023 VA examination to evaluate his service connected residual scar over the left inner thigh for an excised cyst.? 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for fibromyalgia have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.? 

2. The criteria for a?compensable?rating for allergic?rhinitis?have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code?6522. 

3. The criteria a disability rating higher than 10 percent for a residual scar over the left inner thigh for an excised cyst have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code?7804. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in active duty in the U.S. Air Force from August 1987 to May 1996.  The Veteran then served active duty in the U.S. Army National Guard from January 2010 to January 2011; March 2013 to February 2014; from February 2014 to February 2015; from March 2015 to October 2015; and from March 2016 to July 2022.  The service treatment records show additional service in the Army National Guard. 

This appeal comes from an April 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision.  See VA Form 10182 AMA Notice of Disagreement (Direct Review Lane) received April 2024.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AMA decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Beyond the above, it is valuable to note that the Veteran has been granted a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), and is receiving a 100 percent disability since August 1, 2022, the entire period on appeal, in addition to special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) (requiring one disability rated at 100 percent, and others combining to 60 percent).

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.??38?U.S.C. § 1131;?38?C.F.R. §?3.303.? Service connection means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service, or if preexisting service, was aggravated therein.??38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).??????? 

To establish service connection for a disability, there must be competent evidence of the following: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or "nexus" between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.? Horn v.? Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?231, 236 (2010);?Shedden?v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004);?Gutierrez v.?Principi, 19?Vet. App.?1, 5 (2004) (citing Hickson v.?West, 12?Vet. App.?247, 253 (1999)).? In many cases, medical evidence is required to meet the requirement that the evidence be "competent."? However, when a disability may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature" and is capable of lay observation.? Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 309 (2007).??????? 

Service connection for certain chronic diseases?may be presumed to have been incurred in service by showing that the disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1112;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).? Such a chronic disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even though there is no evidence of that disease during the period of service.??38?C.F.R. §§?3.307(a).??????? 

When a chronic disease is shown in service, sufficient to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.??38?C.F.R. §?3.303 (b).? To be "shown in service," the disease identity must be established, and the diagnosis must not be subject to legitimate question.??Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2013);?see also 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b).? There is no "nexus" requirement for compensation for a chronic disease which was shown in service, so long as there is an absence of intercurrent causes to explain post-service manifestations of the chronic disease. Walker, 708 F.3d at 1336.??????? 

Service connection also is available under certain circumstances for undiagnosed illnesses.  In order to obtain a grant of service connection pursuant to?38 U.S.C. § 1117 and C.F.R. § 3.317, a veteran needs to present some evidence (1) that he or she is a Persian Gulf Veteran; (2) who exhibits objective indications of chronic disability resulting from an illness or combination of illnesses manifested by one or more signs or symptoms such as those listed in paragraph (b) of?38 C.F.R. § 3.317; (3) which became manifest either during active military, naval or air service in the?Southwest?Asia?theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 31, 2026; and (4) that such symptomatology by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis.?38 C.F.R. § 3.317?(a); see Neumann v. West,?14?Vet. App.?12, 22?(2000), vacated on other grounds,?14?Vet. App.?304 (2001) (per curiam order); Gutierrez v. Principi,?19?Vet. App.?1?(2004). 

For purposes of?38 C.F.R. § 3.317, there are three types of qualifying chronic disabilities: (1) an undiagnosed illness; (2) a medically unexplained chronic multi symptom illness; and (3) a diagnosed illness that the Secretary determines in regulations prescribed under?38 U.S.C. § 1117?(d) warrants a presumption of service-connection. 

An undiagnosed illness is defined as a condition that by history, physical examination and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to a known clinical diagnosis.  In the case of claims based on undiagnosed illness under?38 U.S.C. § 1117;?38 C.F.R. § 3.117, unlike those for "direct service connection," there is no requirement that there be competent evidence of a nexus between the claimed illness and service.  Gutierrez v. Principi,?19?Vet. App.?1, 8-9?(2004).  Further, lay persons are competent to report objective signs of illness.?Id.? 

Medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illnesses are defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms, and are currently limited to chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural gastrointestinal diseases), as the Secretary has not determined that any other conditions meet the criteria for a medically unexplained chronic multi symptom illness.  Chronic multisymptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology will not be considered medically unexplained.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.317?(a)(2);?75 Fed. Reg. 61995-97?(Oct. 7, 2010) (adding diabetes and multiple sclerosis as examples of chronic multi-symptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology). 

38 C.F.R. § 3.317?also allows for service connection on a presumptive basis for certain enumerated infectious diseases.  See?75 Fed. Reg. 59968-72?(Sept. 29, 2010) (amending?38 C.F.R. § 3.317?(c) to allow for presumptive service connection for nine infectious diseases.)  As none of the enumerated diseases are at issue in this case, the Board has omitted listing the diseases or discussing them. 

Section 3.317 explicitly acknowledges that a claimant's "signs or symptoms" need not be shown by medical evidence; however, the regulation does specifically require some "objective indications" of disability.  See?38 C.F.R. § 3.317?(a). "Objective indications of chronic disability" include both "signs," in the medical sense of objective evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical indicators that are capable of independent verification.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(3).  Signs or symptoms that may be manifestations of undiagnosed illness include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) fatigue; (2) signs or symptoms involving skin; (3) headache; (4) muscle pain; (5) joint pain; (6) neurologic signs or symptoms; (7) neuropsychological signs or symptoms; (8) signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower); (9) sleep disturbances; (10) gastrointestinal signs or symptoms; (11) cardiovascular signs or symptoms; (12) abnormal weight loss; and (13) menstrual disorders.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b). 

For purposes of section 3.317, disabilities that have existed for six months or more and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of improvement and worsening over a six-month period will be considered chronic.  The six-month period of chronicity will be measured from the earliest date on which the pertinent evidence establishes that the signs or symptoms of the disability first became manifest. ?38 C.F.R. § 3.317?(a)(4). 

Lastly, compensation shall not be paid under section 3.317 if there is affirmative evidence that an undiagnosed illness was not incurred during active military service in the?Southwest?Asia?theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War; if there is affirmative evidence that an undiagnosed illness was caused by a supervening condition or event that occurred between the veteran's most recent departure from active duty in the?Southwest?Asia?theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War and the onset of the illness; or if there is affirmative evidence that the illness is the result of the Veteran's own willful misconduct or the abuse of alcohol or drugs.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.317?(c). 

A Persian Gulf Veteran is a veteran who served on active military, naval, or air service in the?Southwest?Asia?Theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.317?(d);?75 Fed. Reg. 59968-72?(Sept. 29, 2010) (reordering this part of the regulation to?38 C.F.R. § 3.317?(e)).  

The Veteran's military records document that he served in?Southwest?Asia?during the pertinent time period.  Therefore, the above-described provisions possibly apply to his case. 

During the pendency of this appeal, the?PACT?Act created a statutory duty for VA to provide a Toxic Exposure Risk Assessment (TERA) examination to any Veteran determined to have been exposed to toxic substances, when there is not sufficient evidence to establish service connection without such an examination.? 38 U.S.C. § 1168?(a).  When providing the Secretary with a?TERA?opinion, the health care provider must consider (1) the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran; and (2) the?synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran.? 38 U.S.C. § 1168?(a)(2)(A-B).  This requirement shall not apply if the Secretary determines there is no indication of an association between the disability claimed by the veteran and the toxic exposure risk activity for which the veteran submitted evidence. ?38 U.S.C. § 1168?(b). 

Here May 2023 and December 2023 VA memorandums verified that the Veteran had presumed toxic exposure pursuant to?38 U.S.C. § 1119, due to his service in the?Southwest Asia theater of operations during the relevant time period and participated in a?TERA?based on an Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER).  As such, the Veteran participated in a?TERA. 

The sub-regulatory guidance defines four exceptions to the requirement to obtain a?TERA?examination and medical opinion: physical trauma, mental disorders, disabilities that have not been shown to have any positive association with herbicide agents exposure, and disabilities that manifested during service or with a clear etiology that is not associated with toxic exposure (to include due to post-service events).  VBA Letter 20-22-10, 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the?PACT?Act,?87 Fed. Reg. 78,543?(Dec. 22, 2022).  As will be discussed in greater detail below, the claimed disabilities denied herein is denied for no current disability. 

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.? VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.? Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.? 38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection fibromyalgia as due to an undiagnosed illness. 

The service treatment records contain no complaints, history or findings consistent with fibromyalgia.  

After service, while VA treatment records show that the Veteran reported having fibromyalgia and requested a referral to pain management, treatment records fail to document a diagnosis or treatment for fibromyalgia.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2023 to evaluate his complaints of widespread episodic joint pain.  The examiner noted the Veteran's Southwest Asia service.  The Veteran reported onset of symptoms, which he attributed to fibromyalgia, in 2015.  

While he had never been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, he reported joint pain in his fingers, arms, hands and leg.  The Veteran described pain throughout his body that felt like he is being stung or pinched, even while at rest.  He did not require medication to treat his symptoms nor was he under any treatment.  

Examination failed to show any tender points or any other underlying pathology.  The examiner noted that although the Veteran presented with subjective complaints, the medical record was silent for the claimed diagnosis of fibromyalgia, treatment or medication, and examination failed to disclose objective findings to support a diagnosis.  

The examiner opined that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, therefore, the claimed fibromyalgia was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran, because a diagnosis of fibromyalgia was not indicated.  

Moreover, fibromyalgia was not a TERA disease therefore, a nexus could not be established.

Review of the evidentiary record shows that there is no competent or probative evidence showing that the Veteran currently has fibromyalgia. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) ("Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability," and held that "[i]n the absence of proof of a present disability[,] there can be no valid claim."); see also Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997) (38U.S.C. §§1131 requires existence of present disability for VA compensation purposes).

The Board notes the Veteran's statements regarding his symptoms which he is competent to report.  However, the Veteran's lay statements must be weighed against the other evidence of record.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

To the extent the Veteran asserts that he has fibromyalgia associated with his service in Southwest Asia, the Board notes that the diagnosis of fibromyalgia requires clinical testing and medical expertise and cannot simply be diagnosed by lay observation alone.  The Board notes that the Veteran has not provided a medical opinion nor supported his contentions with any examination reports or findings that he has any of the claimed disability due to service.  

Simply stated, the Veteran cannot diagnosis himself with a disability and then provide a medical opinion associating it with service many years ago.  He is not qualified.

In any event, compared to the VA medical examination and opinion reports of record, the VA examiner reviewed the claims file, examined the Veteran, and provided an etiological opinion with rationale.  Here the Veteran has only provided bare assertions which are outweighed by the medical examinations of record, as well as the service and post service treatment notes, including the August 2023 Gulf War registry examination findings.  The Board finds that the objective medical evidence is more probative than the lay statements of record.

To the extent the Veteran complains of pain, symptoms alone, the Board has considered whether the Veteran's claimed symptoms are of such severity that these would be considered a "disability" as used in 38U.S.C. §1110.  While functional loss caused by pain is akin to functional loss caused by physical disability, in this case, the Veteran has not demonstrated evidence of a disability.  Cf. Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).  Simply stated, the best evidence in this case provides evidence against the existence of a current "disability."

It is important for the Veteran to understand that the filing of claims in which the Board cannot find even the existence of the problem undermines his credibility with the VA regarding all claims, even issues not before the Board at this time.  Such facts must be considered, particularly in light of the fact that the Veteran's service connected disabilities have a subjective nature to the problems. 

As a diagnosis of fibromyalgia has not been shown at any time during the period on appeal, the Board concludes that the most probative evidence is against the claims, and service connection is denied; the benefit of the doubt rule is not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 1 Vet. App. at 55-56.

Increased Ratings

Ratings for service-connected disabilities are determined by comparing the Veteran's symptoms with criteria listed in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based, as far as practically can be determined, on average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  When rating a service-connected disability, the entire history must be borne in mind.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589 (1991).  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to?compensate?for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal. Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2009). 

The assignment of a particular diagnostic code to evaluate a disability is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case."  See Butts v. Brown, 5?Vet. App.?532, 538 (1993).  One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology. 

2. Entitlement to an initial?compensable?rating for allergic?rhinitis.

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is assigned a noncompensable (0 percent) rating under Diagnostic Code?6522.  Diagnostic Code 6522 provides for a 10 percent rating for allergic rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for rhinitis with polyps.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code?6522. 

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent rating for a diagnostic code, a zero percent rating will be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31. 

After considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to a compensable evaluation at any point during the appeal period. 

On VA examination in January 2024, the Veteran described experiencing pressure with nasal congestion.  He took daily medications.  Examination showed traumatic no evidence of greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  No granulomatous conditions were present.  There were no nasal polyps.  Imaging studies showed no significant mucosal thickening.  The Veteran's?sinusitis did not impact the Veteran occupationally. Allergic rhinitis claimed as sinusitis

The Board notes that during the period on appeal, the Veteran's VA treatment records reflect findings consistent with the VA examination report, and nothing in these records show adverse symptomatology to be worse than what was reported by the above VA examiner. 

As noted above, a?compensable?rating for?rhinitis, under Diagnostic Code 6522 requires a 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or a complete obstruction on one side.  While the VA examination report noted the Veteran's reports of nasal congestion and pressure, the report specifically determined that no obstruction was present and that there were no polyps on examination.  The Board has not overlooked the Veteran's lay statements concerning his?rhinitis, specifically, that he has suffered from persistent nasal congestion.  He is competent to report on factual matters of which he had firsthand knowledge; and the Board finds that his reports concerning his symptoms have been credible.  Washington v. Nicholson, 19?Vet. App.?362, 368?(2005).  There is no basis, however, for concluding that a layperson such as the Veteran is competent to discern the nature, extent, and severity of his?rhinitis?in the absence of specialized medical training, which in this case he has not established.? 38 U.S.C. § 1153?(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303?(a), 3.159(a); Cf. Jandreau,?492 F.3d at 1377; Buchanan,?451 F.3d at 1336-37.  Thus, even affording the Veteran full competence and credibility, the evidence simply does not show entitlement to a?compensable?rating under applicable diagnostic code. 

As such, entitlement to a?compensable?rating is not warranted for the Veteran's allergic?rhinitis?at any time during the appeal period for this claim.  The VA examination and lay reports of record demonstrate a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis with no additional symptoms of polyps or nasal passage obstruction.  No additional available evidence refutes these findings.  Moreover, there is no evidence of record to suggest that the Veteran's symptoms are more appropriately rated under another diagnostic code or that his symptoms are outside the norm such that they are not contemplated by the rating schedule.  The Veteran has not presented argument or evidence otherwise. 

Nothing above should be interpreted as a finding that the Veteran is not having a problem with this disability.  The only question is the degree based on the evidence.  Simply stated, the Veteran does not meet the requirements for a compensable evaluation. 

Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for a?compensable?disability rating for allergic rhinitis?must be denied, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application. See?38 U.S.C. § 5107;?38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, supra.  

3. Entitlement to a disability rating higher than 10 percent for a residual scar over the left inner thigh for an excised cyst.

Under?38?C.F.R. §?3.655?(a), when entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without?a current VA?examination?or reexamination, and a claimant,?without good cause, fails?to?report?for such?examination?or reexamination, action shall be taken in accordance with?38?C.F.R. §?3.655?(b) or (c) as appropriate.? Examples of?good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant, and death of an immediate family member.? See?38?C.F.R. §?3.655.? 

38?C.F.R. §?3.655(b) provides that when a claimant?fails?to?report?for an examination scheduled in conjunction with a claim for increase, "the claim shall be?denied."? A claim for a higher?initial?rating is an "original compensation claim" and not a "claim for increase" for purposes of?38?C.F.R. §?3.655?(b).? See?Turk?v. Peake,?21?Vet. App.?565, 570?(2008).?? 

In August 2023 the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) sent the Veteran letter informing the Veteran that an examination had been requested in order to determine the current level of his residual scar.  The AOJ received notification that the Veteran failed to report to the examination scheduled for September 2023.? There is no documentation in the claims file that the Veteran contacted VA regarding the missed examination.? 

The current claim for increased rating for a disability rating higher than 10 percent for a residual scar over the left inner thigh for an excised cyst is not an original compensation claim but is, instead, a claim for increase.? With respect to the increased rating claim, the September 2023 VA examination was necessary to evaluate the Veteran's assertion that a higher disability rating was warranted and to determine the current level of severity of the service-connected residual scar.? The Veteran failed to report, without good cause, for the scheduled VA examination in conjunction with the increased rating claim.? 

(Continued on the next page)

?

As such, the criteria for a denial based on the application of 38?C.F.R. §?3.655 have been met regarding the claim for an increased evaluation for the service-connected residual scar over the left inner thigh for an excised cyst.? The use?of?the word "shall" in?38?C.F.R. §?3.655?(b) leaves no discretion in this matter.? Based?on the foregoing, the claim for?an increased rating for a residual scar over the left inner thigh for an excised cyst must be denied.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.655;?Sabonis?v. Brown, 6?Vet. App. 426, 430?(1994).? Therefore, the appeal for entitlement to a disability rating higher than 10 percent for a residual scar over the left inner thigh for an excised cyst is denied.

Attorney for the Board	Azizi, T.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
