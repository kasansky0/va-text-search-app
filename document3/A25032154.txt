REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army from December 1983 to September 1992 and from January 1994 to August 2009.  

A July 26, 2022, rating decision denied earlier effective dates and continued the ratings for kidney stones, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral lower extremity neuropathy (sciatic nerves), bilateral lower extremity neuropathy (saphenous nerves), and continued ratings for left shoulder strain, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and denied entitlement to TDIU and an earlier effective date for DEA. The Veteran requested higher-level review in December 2022. A March 6, 2023, rating decision continued the ratings and denials. The Veteran timely appealed the March 2023 rating decision to the Board and requested the Board's Direct Review docket in a February 2024 VA Form 10182 and appealed only the above issues. 

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review docket, the Board may consider the evidence of record as of July 26, 2022-the date of the rating decision which prompted the higher-level review requested. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 3.2601(f). If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after July 26, 2022, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. 

Lastly, the Veteran, through his authorized attorney-representative, waived any additional VA notice, assistance, or any errors that were of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal. Specifically, the attorney representative waived any errors and/or Board development multiple times in the submitted brief. See 2/23/2024, VA Form 10182. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The percentages are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. 

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, the Board must also consider staged ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007). 

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided; however, separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994); 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. 

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by his senses. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a).

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for a left shoulder strain

The Veteran asserts entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for a left shoulder strain. He is rated under diagnostic code 5201. 

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a[or 4.73] criteria.").

However, a veteran may be entitled to a higher disability evaluation than that supported by mechanical application of the rating schedule where there is evidence that his or her disability causes "additional functional loss i.e., 'the inability...to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination[,] and endurance' including as due to pain and/or other factors" or "reduction of a joint's normal excursion of movement in different planes, including changes in the joint's range of movement, strength, fatigability, or coordination." Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107, 117-18 (2017) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.45); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 36-37 (2011); DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 205-07 (1995).

The intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint and periarticular pathology as productive of disability. It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or maligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

Disabilities of the shoulder and arm are evaluated under rating criteria that contemplate ankylosis of scapulohumeral articulation (Diagnostic Codes 5200), limitation of motion of the arm (Diagnostic Code 5201), other impairment of the humerus (Diagnostic Code 5202) or the impairment of the clavicle or scapula, to include dislocation (Diagnostic Code 5203).

Normal range of motion of the shoulder is as follows: forward elevation (flexion) to 180 degrees; abduction to 180 degrees; internal rotation to 90 degrees; and external rotation to 90 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate I.

Where arm limitation of motion is limited to 25 degrees from the side, a 40 percent evaluation is assigned for the major side under diagnostic code 5201 (30 percent for minor side). Limitation of motion midway between the side and shoulder level contemplates a 30 percent evaluation for the major side (20 percent for minor side), and limitation of motion at shoulder level contemplates a 20 percent evaluation for the major side. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5201.

Under Diagnostic Code 5202, for impairment of the humerus, a 20 percent rating is granted when there is malunion, with moderate deformity, for the major arm; a 30 percent rating is warranted when there is marked deformity of the major arm. Also, under Diagnostic Code 5202, for recurrent dislocations of the major arm at the scapulohumeral joint, a 20 percent rating is granted with infrequent episodes, and guarding of movement only at shoulder level; a 30 percent rating is granted for the major arm when there are frequent episodes and guarding of all arm movements. For fibrous union of the major arm a 50 percent rating is assigned for the major arm. A 60 percent rating is warranted for nonunion (false flail joint) of the major arm. An 80 percent rating is warranted for loss of head of (flail shoulder) for the major arm. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5202.

Further, under Diagnostic Code 5203, for impairment of the clavicle or scapula in the major arm, a 10 percent rating is granted for malunion or nonunion without loose movement and a 20 percent rating is granted for nonunion with loose movement or for dislocation.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended DCs 5201 and 5202 to clarify that loss of motion includes flexion or abduction under DC 5201. Additionally, specific range of motion measurements were established. For a 20 percent rating, at shoulder level, flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees. For a 30 percent rating (20 percent minor side), midway between side and shoulder level, flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees. For a 40 percent rating (30 percent for minor side), flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from side. Under DC 5202, impairment of the humerus, movement only at shoulder level is defined as flexion and/or abduction at 90 degrees. Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5201, 5202.

Prior to February 7, 2021, the Board will apply the prior rating criteria. From February 7, 2021, onward, the Board applies the criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran.

The Veteran is right hand dominant as noted in the October 2019 examination. 

The Veteran underwent an examination for his left shoulder disorder in October 2019. See 10/14/2019, C&P Exam. He reported progressive shoulder pain and had flare-ups where he had stiffness and limited motion. He also had functional loss with limited motion. His flexion and abduction were limited to 170 degrees, external rotation to 90 degrees, and internal rotation was 70 degrees. He had pain on flexion, abduction, and internal rotation. Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion. He did not have evidence of pain on non-weight bearing. 

Additionally, he had mild pain on palpation and had crepitus. The Veteran was able to perform three times repetitive use testing with no additional loss of function or range of motion. The examination was medically consistent with the Veteran's statements describing functional loss with repetitive use over time and during flare-ups. Pain caused reduced range of motion. His flexion was 165 degrees and external rotation was 80 degrees after repetitive use and during flare-ups. Shoulder strength was normal (5/5), and he did not have muscle atrophy or ankylosis. No rotator cuff condition was suspected, nor was shoulder instability, dislocation, or labral pathology. No clavicle, scapula, acromioclavicular joint, or sternoclavicular joint condition was noted. The Veteran did not have loss of head, nonunion, or fibrous union of the humerus and did not have malunion of the humerus with moderate or marked deformity. 

In April 2022, the Veteran participated in an additional shoulder examination. See 4/6/2022, C&P Exam. He reported pain if he lifted objects over his head. He had intermittent pain, and decreased range of motion. At the time, he denied flare-ups. Functional loss was noted with difficulty with overhead lifting and carrying heavy objects for extended periods of time.  His flexion was limited to 145 degrees, abduction of 105 degrees, and external/internal rotation to 90 degrees. He had pain on abduction and external rotation. Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion. The Veteran had pain on flexion and abduction. 

The Veteran had pain on active motion, did not have crepitus, and had dull localized tenderness on palpation that was mild. The Veteran was able to perform three times repetitive use testing with no additional loss of function or range of motion. Pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination did not significantly limit functional ability with repeated use over time. He did not have muscle atrophy or ankylosis. No rotator cuff condition was noted. He did not have shoulder instability, dislocation, or labral pathology. No clavicle, scapula, acromioclavicular joint, or sternoclavicular joint condition was noted. The Veteran did not have loss of head, nonunion, or fibrous union of the humerus and did not have malunion of the humerus with moderate or marked deformity.

After review of the competent and probative evidence, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 20 percent for the left shoulder disability is not warranted under DC 5201. The minimum compensable rating for limitation of the shoulder joint is 20 percent. Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472, 482 (2016); see 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5201. The Court indicated that the minimum rating for the shoulder joint, as opposed to any diagnostic code for a shoulder disability, would be assigned under DC 5201 rather than DC 5203 when applying § 4.59. Id. As the evidence demonstrates painful motion of the shoulder, the Veteran is entitled to the minimum rating of 20 percent for the entirety of the appeal under DC 5201.

A rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted. The relevant competent evidence does not tend to show that the Veteran's left shoulder disability was more nearly approximated as flexion/abduction limited to 25 degrees. In this regard, his range of motion testing has been normal or greater than 105 degrees for flexion and abduction as reported in the above examinations. Considering the Veteran's statements regarding his functional loss and impairment, he has indicated, for example, that he has difficulty with overhead motions as indicated in the 2022 examination. Based on the evidence of record, to include the Veteran's competent lay statements, there is no indication that his shoulder is more nearly approximated by flexion/abduction of 25 degrees even when accounting for functional loss.

The Board also acknowledges his statements regarding his flare-ups at the 2019 examination. However, his statements do not indicate that he had range of motion more nearly approximated by flexion/abduction of 25 degrees.

For the periods he has had flare-ups, he reported pain which the Board finds would be more nearly approximated by midway between the side and shoulder level. He has stated that he had difficulty with overhead movement which the Board finds that even when resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran is more nearly approximated by flexion/abduction of 45 degrees. 

The Veteran does not have ankylosis as shown in the above competent medical reports. In this regard, the above examinations show that while the Veteran has pain, functional impairment, and the Veteran has reported that he has limited motion, he is able to perform some range of motion which demonstrates that he does not have ankylosis. The Veteran is able to perform activities of daily living although with difficulty. This evidence tends to show the Veteran's shoulder does retain some motion, so this evidence does not support the functional equivalent of ankylosis. See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021) (holding that the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine contemplates the functional equivalent of ankylosis).

Concerning Diagnostic Code 5202, recurrent dislocation at the scapulohumeral joint, fibrous union of the humerus, and malunion of the humerus are not shown. Indeed, the competent and probative examinations, as noted above, consistently note the absence of any of these disabilities. Additionally, ankylosis or the functional equivalent of it has not been shown, thus a rating is not warranted per Diagnostic Code 5200. Additionally, a separate rating under DC 5203 is not warranted. The above examinations, to include in 2019 and 2022, and his treatment records do not show clavicle or scapula impairment. The Veteran did not assert that he has dislocations.

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent. As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with cirrhosis

The Veteran asserts entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with cirrhosis which is currently rated at 20 percent under Diagnostic Code 7312-7345 (Chronic liver disease without cirrhosis). 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 (Schedule of ratings digestive system).

Under Diagnostic Code 7312 for cirrhosis of the liver. Under the pre-amendment code, a 30 percent is assigned for portal hypertension and splenomegaly, with weakness, anorexia, abdominal pain, malaise, and at least minor weight loss. A 50 percent is assigned for history of one episode of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or hemorrhage from varices or portal gastropathy (erosive gastritis). A 70 percent is assigned for history of two or more episodes of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or hemorrhage from varices or portal gastropathy (erosive gastritis), but with periods of remission between attacks. A total rating is assigned for generalized weakness, substantial weight loss, and persistent jaundice, or with one of the following refractories to treatment: ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hemorrhage from varices or portal gastropathy (erosive gastritis).

Under DC 7345, chronic liver disease without cirrhosis, A noncompensable rating is warranted when hepatitis is non symptomatic. A 10 percent rating is warranted for intermittent fatigue, malaise, and anorexia, or incapacitating episodes (with symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, arthralgia, and right upper quadrant pain) having a total duration of at least one week, but less than two weeks, during the past 12-month period.

A 20 percent rating is warranted when there is daily fatigue, malaise, and anorexia (without weight loss or hepatomegaly), requiring dietary restriction or continuous medication, or; incapacitating episodes (with symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, arthralgia, and right upper quadrant pain) having a total duration of at least two weeks, but less than four weeks, during the past 12-month period.

A 40 percent rating is warranted when there is daily fatigue, malaise, and anorexia, with minor weight loss and hepatomegaly, or; incapacitating episodes (with symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, arthralgia, and right upper quadrant pain) having a total duration of at least four weeks, but less than six weeks, during the past 12-month period.

A 60 percent rating is warranted when there is daily fatigue, malaise, and anorexia, with substantial weight loss (or other indication of malnutrition), and hepatomegaly, or; incapacitating episodes (with symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, arthralgia, and right upper quadrant pain) having a total duration of at least six weeks during the past 12-month period, but not occurring constantly.

A 100 percent rating is warranted when there are near-constant debilitating symptoms (such as fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, arthralgia, and right upper quadrant pain). 38 C.F.R. § 4.114.

The Board notes that effective May 19, 2024, VA amended the rating criteria for the digestive system. However, the Board may not apply an amended regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). 

Under the new criteria for DC 7312, a 10 percent rating is warranted for liver disease with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score greater than 6 but less than 10; or with evidence of either anorexia, weakness, abdominal pain or malaise. A 30 percent rating is warranted for liver disease with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of 10 or 11; or with signs of portal hypertension such as splenomegaly or ascites (fluid in the abdomen) and either weakness, anorexia, abdominal pain, or malaise. A 60 percent rating is warranted for liver disease with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score greater than 11 but less than 15; or with daily fatigue and at least one episode in the last year of either (1) variceal hemorrhage, or (2) portal gastropathy or hepatic encephalopathy. A 100 percent rating is warranted for liver disease with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score greater than or equal to 15; or with continuous daily debilitating symptoms, generalized weakness and at least one of the following: (1) ascites (fluid in the abdomen), or (2) a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or (3) hepatic encephalopathy, or (4) variceal hemorrhage, or (5) coagulopathy, or (6) portal gastropathy, or (7) hepatopulmonary or hepatorenal syndrome.

Under DC 7345, chronic liver disease without cirrhosis, a 0 percent rating is warranted if the condition is asymptomatic. A 20 percent rating is warranted for chronic liver disease with at least one of the following: (1) intermittent fatigue, (2) malaise, (3) anorexia, (4) hepatomegaly, or (5) pruritus. A 40 percent rating is warranted for progressive chronic liver disease requiring continuous medication and causing minor weight loss and at least two of the following: (1) daily fatigue, (2) malaise, (3) anorexia, (4) hepatomegaly, (5) pruritus, and (6) arthralgia. A 60 percent rating is warranted for progressive chronic liver disease requiring continuous medication and causing substantial weight loss and at least two of the following: (1) daily fatigue, (2) malaise, (3) anorexia, (4) hepatomegaly, (5) pruritus, and (6) arthralgia. A 100 percent rating is warranted for Progressive chronic liver disease requiring use of both parenteral antiviral therapy (direct antiviral agents), and parenteral immunomodulatory therapy (interferon and other); and for six months following discontinuance of treatment.

The Veteran participated in a liver examination in December 2018. See 12/26/2018, C&P Exam. The Veteran reported bloating and dull pain. Continuous medication (Vitamin E, phenofibrate, cyanocobalamin, and Cholecalciferol) was reported. He had intermittent fatigue and daily right upper quadrant pain. Daily abdominal pain was noted for his cirrhosis. He had severe steatosis and liver stiffness. His AST was 54 and his ALT was 65.

In October 2019, an additional VA examination was performed. See 10/14/2019, C&P Exam. He had pain in his right upper abdomen and took Lipitor and Gemfibrozil. The examiner noted intermittent fatigue and right upper pain as symptoms of hepatitis.

The Veteran's most recent examination for his liver is from April 2022. See 4/6/2022, C&P Exam. The Veteran reported that his liver levels had increased. He would occasionally have tenderness in his stomach around his liver. He took Rifaxamin PO BID. 

After review of the competent and probative evidence, the Board finds a rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted under the prior rating criteria for DC 7312 or 7345. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's daily fatigue, as well as his right upper quadrant pain. For an increased rating under DC 7312, the Veteran has not had portal hypertension and splenomegaly, with weakness, anorexia, abdominal pain, malaise, and at least minor weight loss. Additionally, for an increased rating under DC 7345, he has not had minor weight loss and hepatomegaly, or; incapacitating episodes (with symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, arthralgia, and right upper quadrant pain) having a total duration of at least four weeks, but less than six weeks, during the past 12-month period.

Additionally, an increased rating under the revised criteria under DC 7312 is not warranted. In this regard, the Veteran does not have liver disease with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of 10 or 11; or with signs of portal hypertension such as splenomegaly or ascites (fluid in the abdomen) and either weakness, anorexia, abdominal pain, or malaise as shown in the 2018, 2019, and 2022 VA examinations. Nor is a rating under revised DC 7345 warranted. The Veteran's liver disorder has not caused minor weight loss with daily fatigue, malaise, anorexia, hepatomegaly, pruritus, and/or arthralgia.

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent. As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

3. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity neuropathy prior to September 5, 2019

4. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity neuropathy prior to September 5, 2019

5. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity neuropathy from September 5, 2019, onward

6. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity neuropathy from September 5, 2019, onward.

7. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right lower extremity neuropathy (saphenous nerve)

8. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left lower extremity neuropathy (saphenous nerve)

The Veteran receives initial 10 percent ratings for bilateral lower extremity neuropathy (external popliteal nerve) prior to September 5, 2019, and 20 percent ratings thereafter for the (sciatic nerve). He also receives noncompensable ratings for bilateral lower extremity neuropathy involving the saphenous nerves effective September 17, 2018. 

Initially, the Board recognizes the issues on appeal are initial increased ratings for bilateral lower extremity neuropathy. In this regard, the Veteran's claims were granted in an October 2012 rating decision. See 10/11/2012, Rating - Under Review. His claims were continued in an August 2013 rating decision. See 8/22/2013, Rating Decision - Narrative. The Veteran requested higher ratings in May 2014. See 5/8/2014, Correspondence. The ratings were continued in March and June 2015 (following a request for reconsideration). See 3/14/20215, Rating Decision - Narrative; 6/29/2015, Rating Decision. The Veteran filed a claim in October 2015, and his ratings were continued in December 2015. See 12/31/2015, Rating Decision - Narrative. The Veteran opted into RAMP in April 2018, and in an October 2018 rating decision, he was granted noncompensable ratings for the saphenous nerve. See 10/29/2018, Rating Decision - Narrative. A supplemental claim was filed in September 2019. See 9/5/2019, VA Form 20-0995. Then, the RO granted 20 percent ratings for the sciatic nerve in a December 2019 rating decision. See 12/19/2019, Rating Decision - Narrative. 

Paralysis of the internal saphenous nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8527. (Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 8627 and 8727). Under these criteria, mild to moderate paralysis is rated as noncompensable. Severe to complete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R § 4.124a.

Under DC 8721, applicable to neuralgia of the external popliteal nerve (common peroneal), a 10 percent rating is warranted for incomplete paralysis that is mild. A 20 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis. A 30 percent rating is assigned for severe incomplete paralysis. Finally, a maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520.

Complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve exists when the foot dangles and drops, there is no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, and flexion of the knee is weakened or (very rarely) lost. This is evaluated as 80 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy is evaluated as 60 percent disabling. Moderately severe paralysis is evaluated as 40 percent disabling. Moderate paralysis is evaluated as 20 percent disabling, and mild paralysis is 10 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Code 8520. The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for "complete paralysis" given for each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating for incomplete paralysis should be for the mild, or, at most, the moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves, Note [to the prior rating schedule].

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various diagnostic codes are not defined in the VA Rating Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence, to the end that its decisions are equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. In the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning. Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015) (citations omitted). Absent an express definition, it is presumed that VA regulations employ words using their ordinary dictionary meanings at the time the regulations were promulgated. See Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 805-06 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (stating that when terms are not defined, it is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that they are deemed to have their ordinary meaning).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) does not "carry the force of law." DAV v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 859 F.3d 1072, 1077 (2017). It is "an internal manual used to convey guidance to VA adjudicators. It is not intended to establish substantive rules beyond those contained in statute and regulation." Id. (quoting 72 Fed. Reg. 66,218, 66,219 (Nov. 27, 2007)).

The M-21 provisions do not go through the regular rulemaking procedures and is little more than evidence as to how VBA applies law and regulation in practices; it is not binding on the Board as it is not a regulation, instruction of the Secretary, or OGC opinion. Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c). The regulations further clarify that the Board "is not bound by Department manuals, circulars, or similar administrative issues." 38 C.F.R. § 20.105.

In Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018), however, the CAVC held that the Board is required to discuss "any relevant provisions contained in the [M-21] as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases, but because it is not bound by those provisions, it must make its own determination before it chooses to rely on an [M-21] provision as a factor to support its decision." The CAVC has stated, on at least two prior occasions, that, where the rating applicable rating criteria contains terms that are undefined, the Board must define those terms as it applies them to the veteran at hand in order to satisfy its obligation to provide adequate reasons or bases. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 254-55 (2018); Spellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 211, 219-20 (2018).

VA's M21-1 provides benchmarks for evaluating the severity of peripheral nerve conditions. See M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.c. The Manual indicates with regard to "mild" as follows: As this is the lowest level of evaluation for each nerve this is the default assigned based on the symptoms, however slight, as long as they were sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment for service connection purposes. In general, look for a disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area. A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.

The Manual indicates with regard to "moderate:" Symptoms will likely be described by the claimants and medically graded as significantly disabling. In such cases a larger area in the nerve distribution may be affected by sensory symptoms. Other sign/symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate.

For moderately severe incomplete paralysis, it is described as follows: the?moderately severe evaluation level is only applicable for involvement of the sciatic nerve. This is the maximum rating for sciatic nerve neuritis not characterized by the organic changes specified in?38 CFR 4.123. Motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at?a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected. Atrophy may be present. However, for marked muscular atrophy see the criteria for a severe evaluation under?38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520. 

Finally, the Manual indicates with regard to "severe:" In general, expect motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases. Even though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve. Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve.

Although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, those standards are "'relevant guidance promulgated for the purpose of facilitating the efficient and proper resolution of claims,' which the Board must consider and address as part of its duty to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision." Chavis, 34 Vet. App.at 18 (quoting Healey v. McDonough, 33 Vet. App. 312, 321 (2021)).

VA has recognized that moderate incomplete paralysis will likely be described by the Veteran and medically graded as significantly disabling and may be demonstrated by combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. In Miller v. Shulkin, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that "[a]lthough the note preceding § 4.124a directs the claims adjudicator to award no more than a 20% disability rating for incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve where the condition is productive of wholly sensory manifestations, it does not logically follow that any claimant who also exhibits non-sensory manifestations must necessarily be rated at a higher level." 28 Vet. App. 376, 380 (2017).

Recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Affairs held that the assignment of ratings based on paralysis does not preclude separate ratings for neuritis or neuralgia of the same nerve. Banschbach v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 422, 429 (2024). The Court explained that each nerve has a diagnostic code and rating scale for paralysis, as well as additional diagnostic codes (but no ratings) for "neuritis" and "neuralgia." Id. at 426. The Court acknowledged that adjudicators must avoid pyramiding, i.e., evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses. However, the Court noted that the rating schedule provides that separate conditions or manifestations of the same condition are to be rated separately, unless otherwise provided by the rating schedule. Id. at 428; see 38 C.F.R. § 4.25(b). Moreover, the Court concluded that the Board must exhaust all schedular alternative for rating a disability. See Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162, 168 (2019). The Court further noted that paralysis, neuritis, and neuralgia are uniquely defined, indicating that each may present separately ratable manifestations. Id.

Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, at times excruciating, is to be rated on the scale provided for injury of the nerve involved, with a maximum equal to severe incomplete paralysis. The maximum rating which may be assigned for neuritis not characterized by such organic changes will be that for moderate, or with sciatic nerve involvement, for moderately severe, incomplete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.123.

Neuralgia, cranial or peripheral, characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain, of typical distribution so as to identify the nerve, is to be rated on the same scale, with a maximum equal to moderate incomplete paralysis. Tic douloureux may be rated up to complete paralysis of the affected nerve. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124.

Turning to the relevant evidence of record, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in August 2012. See 8/28/2012, C&P Exam. The Veteran had bilateral moderate intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness for his lower extremities. Muscle strength testing was normal (5/5), he did not have muscle atrophy, and his deep tendon reflexes were normal (2+). He had decreased sensory testing for his bilateral lower leg/ankle and foot/toes. No trophic changes were noted, and his gait was normal. The examiner indicated mild incomplete paralysis for the sciatic nerves, external popliteal nerves, musculocutaneous nerves, anterior tibial nerves, internal popliteal nerves, posterior tibial nerves, anterior crural nerves, and internal saphenous nerves. EMG studies for the lower extremities were normal in 2011. 

In March 2014, an additional examination was performed. See 3/25/2014, CAPRI. The Veteran had bilateral, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness for his lower extremities. Muscle strength testing was normal (5/5), he did not have muscle atrophy, and his deep tendon reflexes were normal (2+). He had decreased sensory testing for his bilateral foot/toes. No trophic changes were noted, and his gait was normal. He had positive Phalen's sign and Tinel's sign. The examiner indicated incomplete paralysis for external popliteal nerves. 

A VA examination was given in February 2015. See 2/10/2015, C&P Exam. The Veteran had bilateral paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness for his lower extremities. Muscle strength testing was normal (5/5), he did not have muscle atrophy, and his deep tendon reflexes were normal (2+). He had decreased sensory testing for his bilateral foot/toes. No trophic changes were noted, and his gait was normal. He had positive Phalen's sign and Tinel's sign. The examiner indicated incomplete paralysis for internal popliteal nerves. An addendum indicated the paralysis was mild. See 6/29/2015, C&P Exam. 

In December 2015, the Veteran had an examination for his peripheral nerves. See 12/28/2015, C&P Exam. Mild intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness were reported for his bilateral lower extremities. He had normal muscle strength and no muscle atrophy. He had reduced deep tendon reflexes (hypoactive - 1+) for his bilateral lower knee and ankle. He had decreased sensation testing for his lower leg/ankle and foot/toes bilaterally. He did not have tropic changes, his gait was normal, and he had negative Phalen's and Tinel's sign. The examiner reported all the Veteran's lower extremities nerves were normal. 

The Veteran next had an examination in September 2018. See 9/18/2018, C&P Exam. Moderate constant pain was noted bilaterally, and he had mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and numbness. Muscle strength testing was normal, and he did not have muscle atrophy. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. He had decreased sensory testing for his lower leg/ankle and foot/toes bilaterally. He did not have trophic changes and his gait was normal. The examiner reported mild incomplete paralysis for the bilateral external popliteal nerve, superficial peroneal nerve, and anterior tibial nerves. Mild incomplete paralysis was noted for the internal saphenous nerves. 

In October 2019, the Veteran was scheduled for a peripheral nerves examination. See 10/14/2019, C&P Exam. The Veteran reported his symptoms had progressed and he had pain, burning, tingling, and numbness in his feet and lower legs. Moderate intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness were noted bilaterally. Muscle strength testing was normal, he did not have muscle atrophy, and his reflex examination was normal. He had decreased sensation for his bilateral thigh/knees, lower leg/ankle, and foot/toes. He did not have trophic changes and his gait was normal. The examiner reported mild incomplete paralysis for the sciatic nerves, the anterior tibial nerves, and posterior tibial nerves. 

The Veteran's most recent peripheral nerve examination is from April 2022. See 4/6/2022, C&P Exam. The examiner reported the Veteran did not have any symptoms, but also noted mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerves. 

The Veteran wrote that he had not had hair on his lower legs for several years in a March 2016 notice of disagreement. See 3/28/2016, NOD. 

VA treatment records showed burning sensations and numbness in his feet. See 2/9/2012, Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. His feet were sensitive to touch. See 7/18/2018, CAPRI. 

The Veteran's private treatment records show he had burning in his feet. See 6/8/2011, Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. Severe burning pain was noted in September 2015. See 10/7/2015, Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. 

After review of the competent and probative evidence, the Board finds initial ratings of 20 percent, but no higher are warranted for bilateral lower extremity neuropathy involving the external popliteal nerves. The Board also recognizes throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran has had involvement of more nerves than he is currently rated for (external popliteal, sciatic, and saphenous). However, the Veteran, through his attorney, has waived any errors in the evidence of record, and requested the Board not remand his claim. Here, it would have been beneficial for the Board to obtain additional evidence as the evidence regarding which nerves have been involved has been inconsistent as shown through the VA examinations of record. However, as the attorney-representative waived any errors, the Board will only address the currently assigned ratings for the nerves of record. See Janssen v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 370, 373 (2001) (stating that represented appellants may waive a procedural right where they have knowledge of the right and an intent to voluntarily and freely surrender it); see also Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 554 (2008) (explaining that the Board may assume that "an experienced attorney in veteran's law . . . says what he means and means what he says").

The Board finds that initial 20 percent ratings for the external popliteal nerves are warranted. In support, the Board notes several pieces of probative evidence, to include that the Veteran's various radiculopathy symptoms have been described as mild to moderate, as shown in the VA examinations. In support, the above examiners have largely found the Veteran to have either mild or moderate radiculopathy for his external popliteal nerves. The Veteran has reported pain and numbness that have caused functional impairment. At the 2015 examination, he had reduced deep tendon reflexes. 

Additionally, to the extent that the Veteran's 20 percent ratings for his sciatic nerves replaced the ratings for the external popliteal nerves, the Board will resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds the sciatic nerves ratings are in addition to the external popliteal nerves ratings and not replacing them. The Veteran's external popliteal nerves have largely been reported as symptomatic during the period on appeal. The Board has also considered the stability of ratings. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a) ("Rating agencies will handle cases affected by change of medical findings or diagnosis, so as to produce the greatest degree of stability of disability evaluations consistent with the laws and Department of Veterans Affairs regulations."). As such, the Board will continue the ratings for the external popliteal nerves. 

The Board also finds that ratings in excess of the now assigned 20 percent ratings for bilateral external popliteal and sciatic nerves are not warranted at any point during the period on appeal. Additionally, compensable ratings for bilateral neuropathy involving the saphenous nerve are not warranted. The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy attributable to his radiculopathy as reported in the noted VA examinations described above. At times, the Veteran has had reduced deep tendon reflexes (1+) and decreased sensation testing. The Board finds these symptoms to be more nearly approximated as a 20 percent and noncompensable ratings (saphenous nerves) for moderate symptoms as it shows combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes. Additionally, the competent VA examiners, when characterizing the Veteran's neuropathy symptoms during this period on appeal, have generally found them to be mild as recorded in the examination reports. Indeed, the examination reports reflected, at most, moderate symptoms, such as paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and numbness. Overall, the above examination reports reflect a disability picture of the bilateral lower neuropathy that is of moderate severity to include being medically graded as significantly disabling. 

As such, after looking at the overall disability picture for the bilateral lower extremities, the Board finds the Veteran's symptoms were not more nearly approximated as moderately severe or severe (saphenous nerves) as he did not have motor and/or reflex impairment at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability. For the foregoing reasons, higher ratings are not more nearly approximated or warranted.?38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

The Board finds the VA examinations of record to be competent and probative as the evidence was gathered by medical professionals who physically examined the Veteran. 

Lastly, the Board finds that separate ratings for neuritis or?neuralgia?are not warranted here. The evidence of record does not show neuritis and?neuralgia for the sciatic nerve and/or external popliteal. Furthermore, there is no evidence on record of loss of reflex that was not transient. Thus, the Board finds that separate ratings are not warranted. For the foregoing reasons, ratings in excess of 20 percent are not more nearly approximated or warranted throughout the period on appeal. 38?C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

9. Entitlement to a TDIU

Here, the Board finds the period on appeal dates to February 2011 when the Veteran filed his claim for service connection for peripheral neuropathy, as described in the above section. As such, TDIU was raised as part and parcel of the increased rating issue. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009).

A total disability rating may be granted where the schedular rating is less than 100 percent and the veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. Generally, to be eligible for a TDIU, a percentage threshold must be met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

In determining unemployability for VA purposes, consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to age or any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Hersey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 91, 94 (1992); Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000). The sole fact that a veteran is unemployed or has difficulty securing employment is not enough, as a high rating in itself is a recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment. The question is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993) (citing 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.15, 4.16(a)). Entitlement to TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstances. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the term unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 has two components. First, there is an economic component which essentially contemplates an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Second, there is a non-economic component dealing with the individual veteran's ability to follow and secure employment. For the second component, attention must be given to: (a) the veteran's history, education, skill and training, (b) the veteran's physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy or very heavy) required by the occupation at issue, with relevant factors such as lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, reaching, auditory and visual, and (c) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue, with relevant factors such as memory, concentration, and ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers and demonstrate reliability and productivity. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 72-73 (2019).

The Court has stated that "a veteran can establish marginal employment either by demonstrating an income less than the poverty threshold established by the U.S. Census Bureau or by the facts of his particular case." Ortiz-Valles v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 65, 71 (2016) (emphasis in original). Regardless of the method, "if the evidence or facts reflect that a veteran is capable only of marginal employment, he [or she] is incapable of securing or following a substantially gainful occupation and is therefore entitled to [TDIU] if his service-connected disabilities are the cause of that incapability." Id.

In making a determination, the Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate determinations of competence, credibility, and weight. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, all reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Moreover, entitlement to TDIU may be an element of an appeal for a higher rating. Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 453. Entitlement to a TDIU is raised where a veteran: (1) submits evidence of a medical disability; (2) makes a claim for the highest rating possible; and (3) submits evidence of unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001; see Jackson v. Shinseki, 587 F.3d 1106, 1109-10 (2009) (holding that an inferred claim for a TDIU is raised as part of an increased rating claim only when the Roberson requirements are met).

Recently, the Court explained TDIU can be raised at various stages of the claims process and arises when VA rates a disability. Because TDIU can arise any time VA is rating a disability, VA may need to address TDIU as part of separate claim streams when rating different disabilities. TDIU, when part of a claim for increase, is not a separate claim for benefits that VA can grant or deny unmoored from the underlying service connection or increased rating claim. Rather, TDIU is part of that underlying claim, as an option for a potential rating, and the eventual effective date depends on the specific claim VA is then adjudicating. Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394, 400 (2024).

Here, the Veteran filed a formal claim for TDIU (VA Form 21-8940) in September 2019. However, the Board has found that the Veteran had a pending claim for an increased rating for peripheral neuropathy. See generally Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 454 (explaining that the vehicle through which TDIU is raised "is important for purposes of assigning an effective date for an award of compensation" because "[d]ifferent statutory and regulatory provisions apply depending on whether the claim is an original claim or one for increased compensation"); see also Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, *15 (Mar. 13, 2025) (stating that because the TDIU application was a request for higher ratings, it included what was simply a renewed (or continued) quest for higher compensation, including for his tinea pedis and radiculopathy).

The Veteran meets the schedular criteria for TDIU as he has a combined evaluation 70 percent or higher rating with left shoulder strain (20 percent), right upper extremity carpal tunnel (10 percent) and left upper extremity carpal tunnel syndrome (10 percent) rated a combined 40 percent or higher and an overall rating of 70 percent rating or greater from September 1, 2009, onward. For the above purpose of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) disabilities of one or both upper extremities, or of one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable, (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident, (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g. orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric, (4) multiple injuries incurred in action, or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. Id. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Based on the foregoing, his combined evaluation for compensation due to his service-connected disabilities meets the percentage rating standards for TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) from September 1, 2009, onward.

The Veteran's VA Form 21-8940 shows he previously worked in military education until February 21, 2011. See 9/30/2019, VA 21-8940. He has a college education.  

Turning to the relevant evidence, the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy limited his ability to lift with his hands, as well as standing and walking. See 8/28/2012, C&P Exam. He did not have sedentary restrictions due to his neuropathy. 

His upper extremity disorders caused intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness. See 8/28/2012, C&P Exam. 

A vocational assessment was provided in March 2022. See 3/15/2022, Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. The examiner determined the Veteran was unable to secure substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disorders as he was unable to walk or stand for extended periods even in a sedentary position.  

In this case, the record reflects that the Veteran suffered from service-connected disabilities which hindered his ability to maintain gainful employment for the period on appeal. In this regard, he is no longer able to maintain employment because of his disabilities. The Veteran has upper extremity symptoms that caused numbness and pain which would limit his ability to perform any physical position and/or seated position. The Veteran's shoulder disorder has been shown to hinder his ability to lift objects above his head as well as carry objects for extended periods. His upper extremity symptoms would preclude seated work, such as a position that was mostly computer-based work. His ability to perform tasks that required manual dexterity would be impaired (typing, writing, and operating a phone). Additionally, the Veteran had lower extremity numbness and pain which would cause difficulty with extended sitting, standing, and walking. As such, the Board finds that his service-connected disabilities prevent him from being able to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.

Therefore, when resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to TDIU is granted on the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Upon implementation of this decision, the RO will assign an effective date in the first instance to preserve the Veteran's due process rights.

10. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for basic eligibility DEA prior to September 5, 2019.

Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), effective dates relating to awards under Chapter 35 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113. Subsection (b) provides that when determining the effective date of an award under Chapter 35 for an individual described in 38 U.S.C. § 5113(b)(2), based on an original claim, 

VA may consider the individual's application as having been filed on the eligibility date of the individual if that eligibility date is more than one year before the date of the initial decision. For these purposes, "eligibility date" means the date on which the individual became an eligible person as defined by 38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(1), and "initial rating decision" means a decision by VA that establishes the veteran's total disability as permanent in nature 38 U.S.C. § 5113.

In the case of a veteran who is alive, the conditions for basic eligibility for DEA include: (1) the veteran's discharge from service under conditions other than dishonorable; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807 (a). 

Since basic eligibility for DEA benefits may be premised upon the award of a TDIU, and for the reasons explained above for the grant of the Veteran's TDIU, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is also granted for DEA benefits.

Upon implementation of this decision, the RO will assign an effective date in the first instance to preserve the Veteran's due process rights.
