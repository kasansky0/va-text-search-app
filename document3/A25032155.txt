ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively supports a finding that the Veteran has not had a bilateral hearing loss disability for VA purposes at any point during the period on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Coast Guard from August 2000 to August 2010.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral hearing loss due to his period of service.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current bilateral hearing loss disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be established for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the above frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

In adjudicating these claims, the Board must assess the competence and credibility of the Veteran. Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005). Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology and "may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection." Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 405 (1995) (lay person competent to testify to pain and visible flatness of his feet).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

In August 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA audiological examination. The audiologist reported the Veteran's puretone thresholds in the right ear were as follows: 10 at 500 Hz, 10 at 1000 Hz, 5 at 2000 Hz, 10 at 3000 Hz, and 20 at 4000 Hz. See August 2021 VA Examination. The Veteran's puretone thresholds in the left ear were as follows: 15 at 500 Hz, 10 at 1000 Hz, 10 at 2000 Hz, 10 at 3000 Hz, and 25 at 4000 Hz. Id. Speech audiometry using Maryland CNC testing revealed speech recognition ability of 100 percent in both ears, and the VA audiologist noted that the use of speech discrimination score was appropriate for the Veteran. 

In December 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA audiological examination. See December 2023 VA Examination. The audiologist reported the Veteran's puretone thresholds in the right ear were as follows: 15 at 500 Hz, 15 at 1000 Hz, 15 at 2000 Hz, 15 at 3000 Hz, and 20 at 4000 Hz. Id. The Veteran's puretone thresholds in the left ear were as follows: 15 at 500 Hz, 10 at 1000 Hz, 10 at 2000 Hz, 15 at 3000 Hz, and 25 at 4000 Hz. Id. Speech audiometry using Maryland CNC testing revealed speech recognition ability of 100 percent in both ears, and the VA audiologist noted that the use of speech discrimination score was appropriate for the Veteran. 

The Board notes that the Veteran underwent both private and VA audiological evaluations during the course of the appeal, including a private audiological evaluation in August 2021 and VA audiological consults in November 2021, March 2023, and December 2023. However, as these evaluations did not use the Maryland CNC test, the Board finds that the evaluations are not adequate for adjudication purposes. 

After review of the record, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss sufficient to constitute a disability for VA purposes and has not had a disability for VA purposes during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). Therefore, service connection is not warranted. Although the Veteran has reported subjective hearing loss bilaterally, the Veteran's degree of hearing loss is not severe enough to constitute a disability pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The regulations set a clear standard for hearing disability for VA purposes. There is no evidence of record showing that, at any point during the period on appeal, the claimed hearing loss rose to a level that would show speech recognition of less than 94 percent, an auditory threshold at the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz at 40 decibels or more, or at least three auditory thresholds at those frequencies of 26 decibels or more. If the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss worsens in the future, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim and identify any new and relevant evidence at that time.

The Board recognizes the lay statements made by the Veteran regarding his bilateral hearing loss. See August 2021 VA Examination; December 2023 VA Examination. The Veteran is competent to provide lay evidence addressing observable symptomatology. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011). However, as the laws administered by VA assigning disability due to hearing loss requires precise testing of auditory thresholds and speech recognition, the Veteran is not competent to provide a probative opinion as to the presence of hearing loss for VA compensation purposes. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service connection for disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability, and the relevant regulations are very specific with regard to hearing loss. The competent, probative evidence establishes that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss does not reach the level of severity required to constitute a disability for VA purposes. Service connection for bilateral hearing loss must therefore be denied.
