ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 26, 2015, for the award of service connection for heart disease, is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 18, 2023, for the grant of Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) based on permanent and total disability status is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's initial claim for compensation for heart disease was received by VA on March 26, 2015.  The record contains two different April 2015 rating decisions from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying service connection for heart disease; however, given the facial irregularities of the decisions and the record containing no evidence of mailing either decision, the presumption of regularity does not apply and the Veteran's initial claim for heart disease remained pending until the February 29, 2024, rating decision on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of March 26, 2015, for the grant of service connection for heart disease have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5103, 5104, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1976 to November 1979, June 1986 to June 1992, February 2003 to June 2004, November 2004 to August 2005, November 2005 to November 2008, and April 2009 to March 2010.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 rating decision by the VA RO.  In that decision, the RO granted service connection for heart disease with an evaluation of 100 percent effective April 18, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's intent to file.  The RO also granted Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) based on permanent and total disability status.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran requested that an earlier effective date be assigned for service connection for heart disease and DEA, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for heart disease.

The Veteran filed his initial claim, VA Form 21-526EZ, for compensation for heart disease on March 26, 2015, which VA received and date stamped.  At that time, the RO had deferred ratings for separate disabilities based on delays in retrieving the Veteran's service records.  On the day the Veteran filed his initial heart disease claim, the Veteran called the RO and requested an update on the deferred disability determinations for prostate cancer and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and informed the RO that he was filing new claims, including service connection for heart disease following his 2014 heart surgery.  

The RO did not send the Veteran a letter or other notification regarding the development of his March 2015 heart disease claim, including requesting the Veteran to provide any relevant treatment records or scheduling the Veteran for a VA heart conditions examination.  However, the record contains an undated letter addressed to the Veteran; the receipt date associated with this record in the Veteran's claims file is March 30, 2015.  This undated letter does not include the VA seal or the address of the RO issuing the letter.  In relevant part, the letter details the RO's actions to obtain the Veteran's service records and identifies claims filed by the Veteran in June 2010 and November 2010.  The letter does not identify or otherwise reference the Veteran's March 2015 heart disease claim. 

The next-in-time documents in the Veteran's VA claims file are two similar rating decisions, both dated April 27, 2015.  Both indicate that the rating decision is from a "special review of your file [that] was mandated on April 27, 2015," the date on the documents.  Both rating decisions deny the Veteran's heart disease claim.  However, the decisions are formatted differently in how the date is displayed ("4/27/2015" and "April 27, 2015") and how the Veteran is identified (one version containing his middle initial and one not), as well as differences in analyzing the Veteran's multiple claims.  The narrative regarding the Veteran's heart disease claim is the same in both documents.  The rating decisions contain the VA seal, but do not contain information identifying the issuing RO, such as the regional office location or address.  The claims file does not contain a notification letter to the Veteran informing him that a decision has been reached in his claim or explaining his appellate rights.  

For an RO decision to be effective, the RO must provide notice in accordance with section 38 U.S.C. § 5104(a).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(a) ("A decision of a VA rating agency is binding on all VA field offices as to conclusions based on the evidence on file at the time VA issues written notification in accordance with 38 U.S.C. [§] 5104") (emphasis added)).  Such notice must, among other things, be "provide[d] to the claimant and the claimant's representative" and include "an explanation of the procedure for obtaining review of the decision."  Sellers v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 265, 274 (2012) (quoting 38 U.S.C. § 5104(a)). 

The Veteran's counsel has argued that the April 2015 rating decisions in the file never became final because to be considered adjudicated and become final, VA must mail the rating decision to the Veteran and the Veteran's agent.  If the decision was not mailed and the Veteran was not notified of the adverse decision and his appellate rights, his counsel contends that the initial claim remained pending and was not fully adjudicated until the February 2024 decision on appeal.  Therefore, counsel is seeking an earlier effective date to the original date of the receipt of the heart disease claim, March 26, 2015. 

The Board agrees with the Veteran's counsel that the determinative question is whether either of the April 27, 2015, rating decisions in the claims file was mailed to the Veteran in accordance with 38 U.S.C. § 5104.

In making the argument that the rating decision appears to be a draft and not final, the Veteran's representative recognizes the general rule that there is a presumption of regularity with regard to processes and procedures throughout VA administrative processes.  See Marsh v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 381, 386-87 (2005) (presumption applied to the RO's issuance of a statement of claim).  "This presumption supports the official acts of public officers, and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties."  Romero v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 252, 254 (2021) (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14 (1926)).  The presumption of regularity extends to VA's ministerial acts of mailing decisional and notice documents to claimants.  See, e.g., Clarke v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 130, 133 (2007) (applying the presumption of regularity to the RO's mailing of a rating decision).  However, the presumption "is not absolute."  Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307, 309 (1992).  To successfully rebut the presumption, the appellant "bears the burden of producing clear evidence that VA did not follow its regular mailing practices or that its practices were not regular."  Clarke, 21 Vet. App. at 133 (citing Ashley, 2 Vet. App. at 309, and Woods v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 214, 220 (2000)).  An "assertion of nonreceipt, standing alone, does not rebut the presumption of regularity in VA's mailing process," Jones v. West, 12 Vet. App. 98, 102 (1998); additional evidence to corroborate that assertion is required, Clarke, 21 Vet. App. at 133.

The Veteran's representative contends that the additional evidence to corroborate the Veteran's assertion of nonreceipt of an April 2015 rating decision is "the lack of a rating decision cover sheet as required by VA policy," which shows that "either this presumption does not apply, or there is clear evidence that the VA did not follow its procedure."  In evaluating the sufficiency of corroborating evidence for rebutting the presumption of regularity, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) considers facial irregularities of the mailing, such as an undated mailing or if the address is correct.  See, e.g., Crumlich v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 194, 205 (2019) (presumption rebutted because of an undated notification letter); Best v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 322, 325 (1997) (presumption rebutted because notification letter contained too broad of a  description of the disability denied); Crain v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 182, 188-89 (2003) (presumption rebutted when VA mailed a statement of the case to an incorrect ZIP code).  Here, the Board is unable to assess the facial irregularities of a notification letter because the record does not contain a letter informing the Veteran of a decision made with respect to his heart disease claim and his appellate rights.  In addition to the absent notification letter, the Board finds that the rating decisions appear to be drafts that were started on the day that the special review was mandated.  The rating decisions are formatted differently, contain different identifying information for the Veteran, and neither contains an address or identifier for the issuing RO.  Notably, the May 2013 rating decision, which is the closest rating decision in time to the April 2015 drafts, contains the mailing address for the Jackson VA Regional Office.  Given the irregularities of the two April 2015 decisions in the file, the Board finds that the Veteran has provided corroborating evidence to rebut the presumption of regularity.  

As such, the burden shifts to VA to establish that the official duties were properly performed.  See Sthele v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 11, 17 (2004).  Here, the record is absent of any evidence that an April 2015 rating decision was ever mailed to the Veteran or his representative, or that the Veteran was otherwise notified of the rating decision.  VA cannot therefore establish that the Veteran was notified of a decision regarding heart disease claim until the February 2024 rating decision.

The Board further finds that the Veteran did not abandon his heart disease claim during the period that it remained unadjudicated.  Under 38 CFR § 3.158, "[w]here evidence requested in connection with an initial claim or supplemental claim or for the purpose of determining continued entitlement is not furnished within 1 year after the date of request, the claim will be considered abandoned."  Here, there is no evidence that VA requested evidence in connection with the Veteran's initial heart disease claim.  While the record contains an undated letter requesting any available copies of his service treatment records or any other evidence in support of his claim, this letter does not reference the Veteran's March 26, 2015, heart disease claim. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's initial March 26, 2015, claim for heart disease remained pending until the RO's February 29, 2024, rating decision granting service connection.  Accordingly, an earlier effective date for the Veteran's heart disease is warranted.

In assigning effective dates, the general rule is that, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38?U.S.C. §?5110(a); 38?C.F.R. §?3.400.

In his February 2024 VA heart conditions examination, the Veteran reported that in he had three heart blockages in 2014 and required a triple coronary artery bypass graft.  The examiner recorded that the Veteran was diagnosed with arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and coronary artery bypass graft, and provided 2014 as the date of diagnosis for both conditions. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have any other hospitalizations for the treatment of a heart condition other than the 2014 procedure.  The examiner conducted an interview-based metabolic equivalent testing (METs), in which the Veteran reported breathlessness, fatigue, angina, and dizziness; based on this report the examiner estimated that the Veteran was within the one to three Mets level.

In a February 2024 VA medical opinion, the physician opined that the Veteran's coronary artery disease was caused by his service-connected PTSD.  Based on the February 2024 VA examination report and opinion, the RO awarded service connection for the Veteran's heart disease as secondary to the Veteran's PTSD and assigned a 100 percent rating based on a workload of 3.0 METs or less that resulted in heart failure symptoms.  The Board notes that the effective date of the Veteran's primary PTSD disability is November 10, 2010; however, is not  necessary for the Veteran's PTSD to be service connected, or even diagnosed, "for a veteran to be service connected on a secondary basis under a causation theory," as the Veteran is here.  Frost v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 131, 133 (2017) ("there is no such temporal requirement inherent in § 3.310(a), even when the veteran claims that the primary condition caused the secondary condition.").

Based on the above, the Veteran's heart disease condition manifested in 2014 and entitlement to this benefit therefore arose prior to the date of his March 2015 claim.  Accordingly, the effective date of the Veteran's heart disease is based on the later date of receipt of the claim on March 26, 2015.  38?U.S.C. §?5110(a); 38?C.F.R. §?3.400.  An earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for heart disease, March 26, 2015, is therefore warranted.  This is the date of the initial claim for compensation for this disability and the effective date requested by the Veteran's representative.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran was not afforded a VA examination for his heart condition after he initially filed his claim in March 2015.  The first heart conditions examination is the February 2024 VA examination, discussed above.  The record contains limited documentation regarding his 2014 triple coronary artery bypass and recovery; the record does not contain any metabolic equivalent testing during this period.  

Given that the Board has assigned an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for heart disease, the AOJ will in the first instance determine the appropriate evaluation for the Veteran's heart disease for the period of March 26, 2015, to April 18, 2023, after conducting any additional development deemed appropriate.  See Sprinkle v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1180, 1183-84 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (noting that veterans' claims are initially developed and adjudicated by the RO and reviewed on appeal by the Board, and that, "[t]o ensure that claimants receive the benefit of this two-tiered review within the agency, all evidence relevant to a claim generally must be considered by the Regional Office in the first instance").

As noted above, the Veteran in his notice of disagreement also challenged the effective date assigned for DEA, which is April 18, 2023.  Basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits is established for a claimant in one of several ways, including status as the child of a veteran who has a total disability permanent in nature resulting from a service-connected disability. See 38 U.S.C.A. § 3501(a)(1)(A)(ii); 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021(a)(1)(iii).  Given that the AOJ must still determine the appropriate rating for heart disease from March 26, 2015, to April 18, 2023, to include whether the current 100 percent rating is warranted from March 26, 2015, the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for DEA must be addressed after the Board's grant of en earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for heart disease is implemented.

Because the decision in implementing the Board's grant of an earlier effective date for service connection for heart disease could significantly impact a decision on the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for eligibility for DEA, the issues are inextricably intertwined.  See Parseeya-Picchione v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 171, 178 (2016) (claims are inextricably intertwined when a decision on one could have a "significant impact" on the other).  

The AOJ's error in not assigning an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for heart disease was an error in satisfying a statutory or regulatory duty and therefore remand is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for the following action:

After implementing the Board's decision granting an effective date of March 26, 2015 for the award of service connection for heart disease and correspondingly assigning an initial rating for the period from March 26, 2015 to April 18, 2023, determine the Veteran's eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status for the period of March 26, 2015, to April 18, 2023.
