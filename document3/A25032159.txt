REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

1. Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease as proximately due to service connected posttraumatic stress disorder; right shoulder disability; right knee disability; lumbar spine disability; and right and left lower extremity radiculopathy

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) most recently addressed in an August 2022 rating decision.  In July 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal [and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window]. In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for GERD, to include as proximately due to his other service connected disabilities. 

Entitlement to service connection may be established on a secondary basis where there is evidence of (1) a current, non-service-connected disability, (2) a current service-connected disability, and (3) evidence that the non-service-connected disability is either (i) proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability or (ii) aggravated (increased in severity) beyond its natural progression by a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 446 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The July 2023 rating decision on appeal reflects the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of GERD, and that service connection is in effect for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations in May 2022, February 2023, and July 2023. All three VA examiners opined that the Veteran's GERD was less likely than not proximately due to any of his service connected disabilities. Of note, the July 2023 VA examiner posited a causal relationship between the Veteran's obesity and his GERD. 

Obesity per se is not a "disease" or "injury" for purposes of 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1131. VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. However, where a service-connected disability causes a Veteran to become obese; the obesity as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing another disability; and when the other disability would not have occurred but for the obesity caused by the initial service-connected disability, the other disability may be service connected on a secondary basis. VAOPGCPREC 1-2017.

Neither the May 2022, the February 2023, nor the July 2023 VA examiner addressed whether the Veteran's service connected disabilities led to the Veteran becoming obese. 

In January 2023 VA received a medical opinion from a non-VA medical provider who opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's service connected PTSD led to his obesity which, in turn, resulted in his GERD. The examiner noted that symptoms associated with PTSD, to include decreased energy and activity, weight gain related to associated metabolic dysfunction, mood changes, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) dysfunction, and sleep impairment, are associated with physiological or behavioral changes resulting in weight gain. 

In evaluating a claim for disability benefits, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is in at least at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's GERD is proximately due to his service connected PTSD. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for GERD as proximately due to service connected PTSD are met, and the same is hereby granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

2. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as proximately due to service connected posttraumatic stress disorder; right shoulder disability; right knee disability; lumbar spine disability; and right and left lower extremity radiculopathy is granted. 

In December 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), most recently addressed in a March 2014 rating decision.  In July 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal [and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window].  In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for OSA, to include as proximately due to his other service connected disabilities. 

Entitlement to service connection may be established on a secondary basis where there is evidence of (1) a current, non-service-connected disability, (2) a current service-connected disability, and (3) evidence that the non-service-connected disability is either (i) proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability or (ii) aggravated (increased in severity) beyond its natural progression by a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 446 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The July 2023 rating decision on appeal reflects the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of OSA, and that service connection is in effect for PTSD, a right shoulder disability, a right knee disability, a lumbar spine disability, and right and left lower extremity radiculopathy. 

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations in March 2023 and June 2023. Both the March 2023 and June 2023 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's OSA was less likely than not proximately due to any of his service connected disabilities. Of note, both VA examiners posited a causal relationship between the Veteran's obesity and his OSA. 

Obesity per se is not a "disease" or "injury" for purposes of 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1131. VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. However, where a service-connected disability causes a Veteran to become obese; the obesity as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing another disability; and when the other disability would not have occurred but for the obesity caused by the initial service-connected disability, the other disability may be service connected on a secondary basis. VAOPGCPREC 1-2017.

Neither VA examiner addressed whether the Veteran's service connected disabilities led to the Veteran becoming obese. 

In December 2022 VA received a medical opinion from a non-VA medical provider who opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's service connected PTSD, right shoulder disability, right knee disability, lumbar spine disability, and right and left lower extremity radiculopathy led to his obesity which, in turn, resulted in his OSA. The examiner noted that symptoms associated with the Veteran's service connected disabilities, such as pain, sleep disturbances, and diminished motivation are associated with physiological or behavioral changes resulting in weight gain. 

In evaluating a claim for disability benefits, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.
