CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. From May 15, 2013, the criteria for an initial 20 percent rating for a right ankle sprain have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5024, 5270-5274.

2. From May 15, 2013, the criteria an initial 10 percent rating for two painful scars have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from May 1967 to May 1969.

Procedural History - Psychiatric Disorder

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on June 25, 2024.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Lastly, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, the Veteran has continuously pursued his appeal of the March 2021 rating decision in which the AOJ granted service connection for this disability.

Procedural History - Remaining Issues

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the AMA applies.  

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on June 25, 2024.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

For the claims the Board is granting, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

For the claims the Board is remanding, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, the Veteran has continuously pursued his appeal of the March 2019 rating decision in which the AOJ service connected his right ankle strain.

Finally, the Board notes that while this appeal was pending, the AOJ issued a January 2025 rating decision which granted an increased 20 percent rating for the Veteran' right ankle strain effective September 23, 2024 and continued the noncompensable rating for the right ankle scars. 

Issue 1: From May 15, 2013, entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for a right ankle sprain 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Examination reports are to be interpreted considering the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the appellant working or seeking work.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial disability rating assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged rating" is required.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

Musculoskeletal Disabilities

When evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 allows for consideration of functional loss due to pain and weakness causing additional disability beyond that reflected on range of motion measurements.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).  Further, 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 provides that consideration also be given to decreased movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement, swelling, and deformity or atrophy of disuse.  Painful motion is considered limited motion at the point that pain actually sets in.  See VAOPGCPREC 9-98.

Diagnostic Code 5271

Under Diagnostic Code 5271, prior to February 7, 2021, a 10 percent rating was warranted when limitation of motion of the ankle was "moderate."  The maximum 20 percent rating was warranted when limitation of motion was "marked."  Normal ranges of motion of the ankle, both before and after the regulatory amendment, are dorsiflexion from 0 degrees to 20 degrees, and plantar flexion from 0 degrees to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

Prior to February 7, 2021, the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities did not define "moderate" or "marked."  As of that date, VA amended 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a to define them.  It defined "moderate" as dorsiflexion of less than 15 degrees or plantar flexion of less than 30 degrees.  It defined "marked" as dorsiflexion of less than 5 degrees or plantar flexion of less than 10 degrees.   

Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence so that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  It should also be noted that use of such terminology by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue.  All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6. 

Notwithstanding the definitions VA created on February 7, 2021, the Board must evaluate the appeal under both the pre- and post-amended regulation.  Therefore, one possible source for such definitions prior to the amendment would be the dictionary.

Webster's II New College Dictionary defines "moderate" to be "of average or medium quantity, quality, or extent."  Id. at 694 (1995).  Definitions of "marked" include "strikingly noticeable" or "conspicuous."  Id. at 622.  

Merits

In February 2019, the AOJ examined the Veteran.  The examiner reported dorsiflexion of -5 degrees to -5 degrees when the normal range is 0 degrees to 20 degrees.  The examiner also reported that pain, weakness, fatigability, or incoordination limited the Veteran's range of motion with flareups.  Nevertheless, the examiner reported the same range of motion during flareups, i.e., -5 degrees to -5 degrees.

In March 2019, the AOJ requested an addendum opinion to clarify the negative dorsiflexion ratings.  In response, the examiner explained the Veteran can "move the ankle but is unable to dorsiflex greater than -5 [degrees]."  Later that month, the AOJ service connected the Veteran's right ankle sprain.  It rated it as 10 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.  Its grant was effective May 15, 2013.

In June 2019, the Veteran appealed the rating to the Board.

In July 2022, the Veteran testified about the rating.

In January 2023, the Board found the February 2019 exam was inadequate because it did not comply with multiple precedential cases involving the rating of musculoskeletal disabilities.  Therefore, it remanded the claim for a new VA examination.

In May 2023, the AOJ examined the Veteran.  The examiner reported dorsiflexion of 10 degrees.  The examiner also reported that dorsiflexion during flareups was 5 degrees.  

In January 2024, the AOJ denied an initial rating greater than 10 percent.

In February 2024, the Veteran appealed the January 2024 denial.

The period on appeal for the increased initial rating for the right ankle strain is from May 15, 2013 (date of service connection ) to January 31, 2024 (the date of the notification letter for the January 2024 rating decision on appeal). 

In June 2024, the Veteran testified again regarding the initial rating.  On page 12 of the transcript, the Veteran's representative requested the Board consider awarding an extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321 based on the Veteran's "pain, inability to do his ADLs, [and] his lack of motion." 

Prior to February 7, 2021, under Diagnostic Code 5271, the maximum rating - 20 percent - required marked limitation of motion, i.e., limitation that was "strikingly noticeable" or "conspicuous."  Notwithstanding the limitations of the 2019 examination, the Board finds the aforementioned evidence persuasively favors finding an initial rating of 20 percent from May 15, 2013 is warranted.  First, the Veteran testified competently and credibly of marked limited motion due to prolonged weight bearing.  Second, the negative range of motion at the 2019 examination bolsters the Veteran's testimony of limited motion.  Third, the Veteran's estimated range of motion during flareups recorded at the 2023 examination - 5 degrees - is 1 degree greater than the post-February 7, 2021 criteria for a 20 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5271.  For these reasons, the Board finds the Veteran's symptoms exceed the limitation of motion characterized as "moderate," i.e., "of average or medium quantity, quality, or extent."  The Board also finds higher ratings are not available under Diagnostic Codes 5272 (ankylosis of the subastragalar or tarsal joint), 5273 (malunion of the os calcis or astragalus), or 5274 (astragalectomy), pre- or post-revision, because the evidence does not show such symptomatology.  

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence persuasively supports an initial rating of 20 percent for the entire period on appeal.  However, the Board will discuss a potential rating under Diagnostic Code 5270 in the Remand section below.  Because of this, the Board finds resolving the Veteran's contention of an extraschedular rating is premature.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Yancy v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?484, 495 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 38?Vet. App.?366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).  

Issue 2: From May 15, 2013, entitlement to an initial rating greater than 0 percent for right ankle scars

Scar Rating Criteria

The rating criteria for scars are outlined in Diagnostic Codes 7800 through 7805 in the VA Rating Schedule.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118. 

Diagnostic Code 7800 relates to scars of the head, face, or neck.  It provides that a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for a skin disorder with one characteristic of disfigurement of the head, face, or neck.  A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for skin disorder of the head, face, or neck with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with two or three characteristics of disfigurement.  A 50 percent evaluation is warranted for skin disorder of the head, face, or neck with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with four or five characteristics of disfigurement.  An 80 percent evaluation is warranted for skin disorder of the head, face, or neck with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with six or more characteristics of disfigurement.  Note (1) provides that the 8 characteristics of disfigurement, for purposes of rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, are: (1) Scar is 5 or more inches (13 or more cm.) in length; (2) scar is at least one-quarter inch (0.6 cm.) wide at the widest part; (3) surface contour of scar is elevated or depressed on palpation; (4) scar is adherent to underlying tissue; (5) skin is hypo-or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); (6) skin texture is abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); (7) underlying soft tissue is missing in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); (8) skin is indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.).

Diagnostic Code 7801 concerns scars not of the head, face, or neck.  It applies when the scar is associated with soft tissue damage.  To be compensable under Diagnostic Code 7801, a scar must cover at least 39 square centimeters.  

Diagnostic Code 7802 concerns scars not of the head, face, or neck.  It applies when the scar is not associated with soft tissue damage.  To be compensable under Diagnostic Code 7802, a scar must cover at least 144 square inches or 929 square centimeters.  

Diagnostic Code 7803 was eliminated from the VA Rating Schedule prior to the effective date of service connection for the Veteran's scars with some of its provisions being subsumed into Diagnostic Code 7804.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 54710 (Oct. 23, 2008). 

Diagnostic Code 7804 provides progressively higher ratings based on the number of unstable or painful scars.  Diagnostic Code 7804 provides a 10 percent rating for one or two scars that are unstable or painful.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for three or four scars that are unstable or painful.  A 30 percent rating is authorized when there are five or more scars that are unstable or painful.  Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7804 explains an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  Note 2 indicates that, if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, a 10 percent rating should be added to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.  Note 3 states that scars evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7804.  

Diagnostic Code 7805 directs the adjudicator to evaluate any disabling effects not considered in a rating under Diagnostic Code 7800-7804 under an appropriate Diagnostic Code.  

Merits

In May 2023, the AOJ examined the Veteran.  The examiner diagnosed two scars related to open reduction and internal fixation procedures in 1972 and 2008.  He reported, in Section 2-2C on page 4 of the examination report, that Scar #1 measured 15.2 centimeters by 0.1 centimeters, i.e., 1.52 square centimeters, while Scar #2 measured 5 centimeters by 0.1 centimeters, i.e., 0.5 square centimeters.  He further reported that neither scar was painful or unstable.  Additionally, he reported the scars do not have underlying soft tissue damage.

In January 2024, the AOJ service connected "right ankle scars associated with a right ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain with degenerative arthritis."  It rated the scars as a single disability under Diagnostic Code 7805.  It rated the disability as 0 percent disabling effective May 15, 2013.

In February 2024, the Veteran appealed the assigned rating.  In July 2024, the Veteran testified regarding the scars.

The period on appeal for the increased initial rating for the right ankle scars is from May 15, 2013 (date of service connection ) to January 31, 2024 (the date of the notification letter for the January 2024 rating decision on appeal). 

The Veteran has right ankle scars.  Because Diagnostic Code 7800 relates to scars of the head, face, or neck, Diagnostic Code 7800 does not apply.

The Veteran's scars do not have underlying soft tissue damage.  Because Diagnostic Code 7801 concerns scars not of the head, face, or neck associated with soft tissue damage, Diagnostic Code 7801 does not apply.

Diagnostic Code 7802 applies because the Veteran's scars do not have underlying soft tissue damage and are not of the head, face, or neck.  To be compensable under Diagnostic Code 7802, a scar must cover at least 144 square inches or 929 square centimeters.  Here, the Veteran's scars measure 1.52 and 0.5 square centimeters, respectively.  Therefore, the evidence does not support a compensable rating.

Diagnostic Code 7803 was eliminated from the VA Rating Schedule prior to the effective date of service connection for the Veteran's scars with some of its provisions being subsumed into Diagnostic Code 7804.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 54710 (Oct. 23, 2008). 

The Veteran testified competently and credibly that his scars are painful but not unstable.  While this differs from the VA examiner's report, the Board will resolve doubt in the Veteran's favor by finding he has two painful but not unstable scars.  As such, Diagnostic Code 7804 provides a 10 percent rating.

Diagnostic Code 7805 directs the adjudicator to evaluate any disabling effects not considered in a rating under Diagnostic Code 7800-7804 under an appropriate Diagnostic Code.  The examiner noted, in Section 3 of page 9 of the examination report, the scars did not limit function beyond the symptoms recorded in the report.  Therefore, Diagnostic Code 7805 does not apply.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Background Law - Remands

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2)?AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. ?See?38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).

Issue 3: From May 15, 2013, entitlement to an initial rating greater than 20 percent for a right ankle sprain 

The record repeatedly demonstrates the Veteran has severely limited movement in his right ankle.  Flareups, as demonstrated above, further limit his movement.  Despite this, no VA examiner assessing the Veteran's right ankle has addressed whether this limited movement is the functional equivalent of ankylosis.  

Ankylosis and its functional equivalent are related yet distinct concepts.  The functional equivalent of ankylosis arises when application of the effect of pain or other factors identified under 38 CFR § 4.40 or § 4.45, to include during flare-ups and repetitive use over time, results in additional loss of motion to the joint that effectively results in functional impairment consistent with ankylosis.  

Because the AOJ did not seek an addendum opinion on the question of the functional equivalent of ankylosis, the AOJ erred in assisting the Veteran in prosecuting his claim under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A.  Therefore, remand is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) for an addendum opinion. 

Issue 4: From May 15, 2013 to May 25, 2023, entitlement to an initial rating greater than 50 percent for persistent stressor disorder and other specified stressor disorder and other specified stressor and trauma related disorder 

Issue 5: From May 26, 2023, entitlement to an initial rating greater than 70 percent for persistent stressor disorder and other specified stressor disorder and other specified stressor and trauma related disorder 

In March 2021, the AOJ service connected persistent stressor disorder and other specified stressor disorder.  It rated it as 30 percent disabling effective May 15, 2013.

In April 2021, the Veteran appealed the rating assigned.

On February 1, 2023, the Board granted a 50 percent initial rating.  On February 3, 2023, the AOJ implemented the Board's February 1, 2023 grant.  On February 15, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in response to the February 3, 2023 rating decision.  

On May 26, 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim in response to the February 2023 rating decision. 

In August 2023, the Veteran filed a revised supplemental claim in response to the February 2023 rating decision.  As relevant here, it identified a treatment with D.R. of Madison, Alabama dated "May 16" with no year specified.

In December 2023, the AOJ granted a 70 percent rating effective May 26, 2023.

In February 2024, the Veteran appealed the effective date the AOJ assigned in the December 2023 rating decision.

In June 2024, the Veteran clarified the scope of his appeal.  Based on his testimony, the Board has characterized it as an appeal of the staged initial rating.  

In October 2024, the Board construed the February 15, 2023 VA Form 10182 as a motion for reconsideration (MFR) of the February 1, 2023 Board decision.

In February 2025, the Board denied the MFR.  

The Board has recounted this procedural history to clarify its finding that the Veteran has continuously pursued his appeal of the March 2021 rating decision which service connected this disability.

Separately, the AOJ did not attempt to obtain the treatment record for D.R. that the Veteran identified in August 2023.  Because it did not, it erred in assisting the Veteran in prosecuting his claim under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A.  Therefore, remand is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) to attempt to obtain the record.

Issue 6: Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 26, 2023 for the grant of a total disability based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) 

Issue 7: Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 26, 2023 for the grant of Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) 

Issues 6-7 are inextricably intertwined with Issues 3-5.  Therefore, the Board will remand Issues 6-7 but it will not order any development.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion regarding the claim of an increased rating for a right ankle disability.  The Veteran does not need to be examined unless the clinician determines it is necessary.  The clinician should review the record and answer the following:

a)	Does the Veteran's right ankle manifest in the functional equivalent of ankylosis?  Why or why not?

b)	If you determine the Veteran experiences the functional equivalent of ankylosis, please describe its degree as one of the following options and explain your decision:

a.	Plantar flexion, less than 30 degrees,

b.	Plantar flexion, between 30 degrees and 40 degrees, 

c.	Dorsiflexion, between 0 degrees and 10 degrees, 

d.	Plantar flexion, at more than 40 degrees, or

e.	Dorsiflexion, more than 10 degrees with abduction, adduction, inversion, or eversion deformity. 

In answering these questions, the Board advises the clinician that the functional equivalent of ankylosis arises when application of the effect of pain or other factors identified under 38 CFR § 4.40 or § 4.45, to include during flare-ups and repetitive use over time, results in additional loss of motion to the joint that effectively results in functional impairment consistent with ankylosis.  It is related to, yet distinct from, ankylosis.

(Continued on the next page)

?

The clinician must provide a complete rationale for the opinions.

2. Attempt to obtain the "May 16" treatment record with D.R. of Madison, Alabama that the Veteran identified in an August 2023 VA Form 20-0995.
