REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1982 to August 1992.

Procedural History

The present appeal stems from a December 12, 2018, claim seeking increased ratings for service-connected residuals of appendectomy and appendectomy scars.  The claims were denied in a February 2, 2019, Rating Decision, issued prior to the effective date of the Modernized Review System.  In response to the agency decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Hearing Lane.

Analysis

The Board may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the appellant or his or her representative, or on the Board's own motion, when an appellant has been denied due process of law or when benefits were allowed based on false or fraudulent evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

The Veteran sought to appeal a rating decision issued prior to the effective date of the Modernized Review System by using the incorrect form.  Decisions issued prior to February 19, 2019, are reviewed under the legacy appeals system with corresponding rules and procedures, and that system required the filing of a VA Form 21-0958 Notice of Disagreement to initiate an appeal.  However, as to the form discrepancy, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that "[t]he particular form a claimant submits-correct or otherwise-has no bearing on the Board's jurisdiction to hear an appeal."  Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. Appl 329, 330 (2021).  Rather, the form rule amounts to a "claim processing rule."  In Hall, the Court also highlighted the fact that a "claim-processing rule... is ordinarily 'forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.'"  Id at 331-32 (quoting Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 456 (2004)).  Here, in a Board decision dated August 2019, the Veteran was expressly advised that it had placed his appeal on its docket, and the Board has made no indication to the Veteran to revise that position in over five years.

On March 6, 2025, the Board, in pertinent part, issued a decision denying entitlement to increased ratings for service-connected residuals of appendectomy and appendectomy scars.  The Board finds those issues ineligible for review under the Modernized Review System as the agency decision was issued before the effective date of the Appeals Modernization Act, February 19, 2019, and the Veteran filed a timely appeal of the issues, albeit on the wrong form.  38 C.F.R. § 19.2.  As such, in the interest of fair process, the appeals of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for residuals of an appendectomy and to a compensable rating for service-connected appendectomy scars are dismissed.

Notwithstanding the dismissal of the aforementioned issues under the Modernized Review System, congruent action has been taken to restore the issues on appeal under the Legacy system.  In a separate decision, the Board ordered a remand of the present issue to the RO for issuance of a Statement of the Case in accordance with Manlincon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 238, 240-41 (1999).  Thus, the Veteran may pursue appellate review under the Legacy system, if he so chooses, by filing a Form 9 Substantive Appeal following any adverse outcomes included in the Statement of the Case.
