Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 16, 2022, for an award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A September 2020 rating decision became final one year from VA's receipt of an incomplete October 2020 supplemental claim.

2. Clear evidence has not been presented to rebut the presumption of regularity in the mailing of the December 2020 VA notification of incomplete claim. 

3. The Veteran submitted an Intent to File on March 16, 2022, followed by a completed supplemental claim application in November 2022.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to March 16, 2022, for an award of service connection for tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.160, 3.2500(h)(2), 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to March 16, 2022, for an award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.160, 3.2500(h)(2), 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1971 to May 1973. 

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran timely initiated this appeal to the Board by submitting a May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

In view of the above, the Board may only consider the evidence of record that the AOJ was permitted to consider at the time it issued the rating decision on appeal (i.e., the evidence of record at the time the AOJ issued the March 2024 rating decision). 

If evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered such evidence in this decision. The Veteran may file a supplemental claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Earlier Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection is the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5101; 38 C.F.R. § 3.151. A complete claim must provide the name of the Veteran, must be signed by the Veteran, and identify the benefits sought, describing any symptoms(s) or medical condition(s) on which the benefit is based. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a). Upon receipt of a formal claim that is not complete as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), VA shall notify the Veteran and the Veteran's representative of the information necessary to complete the application form. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(c). If the Veteran then files a complete claim within one year of receipt of the incomplete claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the incomplete claim was received. Id. 

Additionally, a Veteran may file a claim for benefits by initially submitting an Intent to File a Claim for Compensation, a VA Form 21-0966, to VA. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). If the Veteran then files a claim within one year of receipt of the form, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the form was received. Id. 

In order to preserve a claim for an earlier effective date, under the AMA, the claim must be continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). For decisions rendered after a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182. Id. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 16, 2022, for an award of service connection for tinnitus. 

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 16, 2022, for an award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran asserts he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss. 

By way of procedural background, the Veteran first submitted a claim for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus on March 22, 2019. A rating decision issued July 2019 denying service connection. The Veteran submitted a request for higher-level review (HLR) in September 2019. An October 2019 HLR rating decision continued to deny service connection. Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in May 2020. A September 2020 rating decision denied service connection. 

In October 2020, the Veteran's representative submitted an Intent to File, followed by an incomplete (unsigned) VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application. By letter dated December 15, 2020, VA notified the Veteran the October 2020 supplemental claim was deficient. He was instructed to complete, sign and return the enclosed supplemental claim form. He was advised no further action would be taken until the completed application was received. The letter specially stated a copy of the letter had been provided to his appointed representative. The representative was listed in "CC." 

On March 12, 2021, VA provided the Veteran's representative with "the entire VA claims folder" in response to his Privacy Act request. 

The Veteran's representative sent VA requests for status updates of the October 2020 VA Form 20-0995 in April 2021, June 2021 and January 2022. 

A January 2022 VA letter notified the Veteran and his representative of the finality of rating decisions pertaining to other Legacy claims. These claims were also listed in the incomplete October 2020 supplemental claim form for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. The VA letter was sent in response to the Veteran's representative submitting a duplicate VA Form 20-0995 for other claims on January 2022, that was previously submitted in June 2019. VA contacted the Veteran on March 2022 to discuss the duplicate form. See VA 27-0820 Report of General Information. Following this call, VA emailed the Veteran a VA Form 20-0995 highlighting the areas that needed to be completed.

The Veteran or his representative submitted an Intent to File on March 16, 2022. The Veteran's representative submitted an Intent to File VA 21-0996 on November 1, 2022, followed by a completed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus on November 29, 2022. In response, a March 2023 rating decision awarded service connection for tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss effective March 16, 2022. 

The Veteran requested HLR of the March 2023 rating decision. A June 2023 rating decision denied an earlier effective date and continued the assigned disability ratings. The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in November 2023. In the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied an earlier effective date for the award of service connection and continued the assigned disability ratings. 

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record in conjunction with the applicable laws and regulations and finds that an effective date prior to March 16, 2022, for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus is not warranted. 

As outlined above, in order to preserve a claim for an earlier effective date, under the AMA, the claim must be continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). The administrative review options include filing a higher-level review request (in response to an initial claim) or filing a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (in response to an initial claim or supplemental claim). 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1), (2). 

38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h) sets forth the effective date implications for continuously pursuing AMA review options. If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). If supplemental claims are received more than one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues notice of a decision or the Board of Veterans' Appeals issued notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

In the AMA system, a claim is considered finally adjudicated when the period to file a review option available under §3.2500 expires or when there is a disposition on judicial review where no review option is available. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d).

Initially, the Board finds the Veteran pursued his service connection claims for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus following issuance of the July 2019 rating decision and October 2019 rating decision, by timely filing one of the appropriate administrative review options specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. A completed supplemental claim was not filed in response to the September 2020 rating decision, however, until November 2022, over two years after the rating decision issued and over one year after lapse of the period to request administrative review, which began to run from the December 15, 2020, VA notification to submit a complete claim. This effectively broke the chain of continuous pursuit for purposes of preserving an earlier effective date under the AMA.

The Veteran's representative asserts they were unaware of the deficiency in the October 2020 VA Form 20-0995 until January 2022. See August 2023 Informal Hearing Presentation. Specifically, they assert (1) the December 15, 2020, VA letter notifying the Veteran of the incomplete application was not sent to their office and they were not aware of it; (2) that the three status inquiries they sent to VA are evidence of such; (3) that it was not until VA issued a letter dated January 26, 2022, stating that the issues had been denied in January 2014, that they became aware of the deficiency in the October 2020 application; and (4) that a completed supplemental claim was provided at that time. 

The Board first addresses the Veteran's representative's assertion that they were not provided a copy of the December 15, 2020, VA notification of incomplete claim. 

As outlined above, upon receipt of a formal claim that is not complete as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), VA shall notify the Veteran and the Veteran's representative of the information necessary to complete the application form. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(c). If the Veteran then files a complete claim within one year of receipt of the incomplete claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the incomplete claim was received. Id. 

VA is entitled to a legal presumption of regularity under which it is presumed that government officials "have properly discharged their official duties." See Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307, 308 (1992) (citing Rosler v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 241, 242 (1991)). Id. at 309. Clear evidence to the contrary is required to rebut the presumption of regularity. See Ashley, 2 Vet. App. 307, (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, 272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926)); see also Mindenhall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 271 (1994).

If a claimant alleges non-receipt of a VA notice letter, clear evidence to rebut the "presumption of regularity" mandates not only a declaration by the appellant of non-receipt, but additional evidence to corroborate the appellant's declaration, such as an addressing error by VA that was consequential to delivery." Clarke v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 130, 133 (2007). For example, an addressing error is consequential where it "results in an address that does not contain all the necessary address elements" sufficient to enable delivery. Id. at 135; see also Crain v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 182, 187 (2003) (sending notice to an incorrect mailing address" constitutes the 'clear evidence' needed to rebut the presumption of regularity that the BVA properly mailed notice" of the Board decision); Boyd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 63 (2014)("the presumption of regularity may be rebutted where there is (1) evidence that VA used an incorrect address on the Board mailing, or (2) evidence that the mailing was returned as undeliverable and there were other possible and plausible addresses available to VA at the time of the Board decision."). Absent evidence that the claimant notified VA of a change of address and absent evidence that any notice sent to the appellant at his or her last known address has been returned as undeliverable, VA is entitled to rely on that address. See Cross v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 18 (1996).

Here the Board finds that clear evidence has not been shown that is contrary to the presumption that regular notification practices were followed, and accordingly, the presumption of regularity applies.

In this regard, the December 2020 VA correspondence was addressed to the Veteran with a "CC" to his attorney. The attorney's name, name of the firm and current mailing address of the attorney was included. It is presumed that a copy was mailed out to the addresses of the Veteran and his attorney. Moreover, no returned mail as undelivered is evident from the claims file. Regarding the Veteran's attorney's correspondence requesting status updates which went unanswered, there is no recognized presumption of regularity for responding to status requests as there is for mailing and notice procedures. Thus, the Board does not find the status inquiries are clear evidence to rebut the presumption of regularity.

The Veteran's attorney further contends that they were unaware of the deficiency of the October 2020 VA Form 20-0995 until receiving a copy of a January 2022 VA letter and submitted a completed supplemental claim at that time. Putting aside the presumption of regularity discussed above, the Board observes that the complete VA claims folder was provided to the Veteran's attorney in March 2021 which would have necessarily included a copy of the December 2020 VA letter. A completed supplemental claim application was not submitted until November 2022. 

Finally, the Board notes that in the May 2024 addendum to the Notice of Disagreement, the representative "argued and preserved" what was characterized as "common errors committed by VA." This comprised seven pages of legal boilerplate to include legal citations not relevant to the Veteran's claim (e.g., "DeLuca Failure"). As this is not pertinent to the Veteran's claims, the Board will not address this further. 

In sum, the September 2020 rating decision denying service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus became final. The Veteran and his representative did not submit a completed supplemental claim within one year of the incomplete October 2020 supplemental claim submission.  An intent to file was submitted on March 16, 2022, followed by a November 29, 2022, VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application. Because the service connection claims were not continuously pursued, the effective date of March 16, 2022, for the award of service connection for tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss was appropriate. 

Based on the foregoing, the evidence of record is persuasively against the claims.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, an effective date earlier than March 16, 2022, for an award of service connection for tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss, is denied.
