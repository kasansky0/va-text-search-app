ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a painful right thumb scar is denied. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus with plantar fasciitis is remanded. 

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a painful right thumb scar at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for painful right thumb scar have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1978 to September 1981 and from September 1990 to May 1991. 

This matter comes before the Board on a March 2023 supplemental claim rating decision. In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence which was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus with plantar fasciitis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a painful right thumb scar is denied. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from an event, disease, or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1110, 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an event, disease, or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service event, disease, or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Here, there is no evidence the Veteran has a current diagnosis or recurrent or persistent symptoms of a painful right thumb scar. In June 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The examiner identified a right thumb scar and, when asked whether the scar was painful, the examiner marked "no." The Veteran's medical treatment records are silent for any complaints of or treatment for a painful right thumb scar. 

As such, based on a review of the record before the Board, there is no diagnosis for a painful right thumb scar, no persistent or recurrent symptoms of a painful right thumb scar, and no evidence of functional impairment impacting earning capacity. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2018).?Therefore, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a painful right thumb scar and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26?Vet. App.?289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?319, 321 (2007).? 

The Board notes that in disability compensation claims, a VA medical examination must be provided when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?79, 81 (U.S. 2006). 

Here, as discussed above, there is no competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a painful right thumb scar.? As such, a VA medical examination is not required. 

As the first required element for direct service connection for a painful right thumb scar has not been met, the remaining elements will not be discussed. Romanowsky, 26?Vet. App.?at 294; McClain, 21?Vet. App.?at 321. As the evidence is not in approximate balance and persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).? Therefore, entitlement to service connection for a painful right thumb scar is denied. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus with plantar fasciitis is remanded. 

After a review of the record, the Board determines a remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 

In disability compensation claims, a VA medical examination must be provided when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.?McLendon v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?79, 81 (U.S. 2006).?

Here, in the March 2023 rating decision, the RO favorably found the Veteran's treatment records provide evidence of "mild hallux valgus and foot pain." The Board is bound by this favorable finding of fact as the record does not contain clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut it. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801. 

In the April 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (Fully Developed Claim) submitted by the Veteran, he asserted his foot injury was due to "marching, running, and wearing boots while in service." As such, there is an indication that the Veteran's mild hallux valgus and foot pain may be associated with the in-service injury reported by the Veteran. Therefore, an examination is warranted and remand is necessary to obtain a VA examination. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's bilateral pes planus with plantar fasciitis. Prior to the examination, the claims file should be reviewed by the examiner.?Upon review of the record, interview, and examination of the Veteran, the examiner should respond to the following: 

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's bilateral pes planus with plantar fasciitis was caused by or the result of an in-service injury, event, or disease? 

The examiner is reminded to consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding the nature and onset of his bilateral pes planus with plantar fasciitis, including any evidence concerning continuity of symptomatology, as he is legally permitted to report his symptoms, past medical history, and experiences. 

The examiner shall not solely rely on the absence of evidence of complaints or treatment in the Veteran's service medical records or other post-service records to discount the Veteran's lay statements unless there is a sound medical basis for doing so.
