DOCKET NO. 250218-512459
DATE: April 8, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral pes planus is remanded.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for left foot hallux valgus is remanded.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from October 1984 to October 1988, February 1990 to April 1998, January 2003 to January 2004, and January 2005 to May 2005.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued on January 29, 2025, and on January 31, 2025, and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.301.

The Board acknowledges that the period to change AMA dockets under 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.202(c)(2) has not yet elapsed. However, the Board finds that a docket switch letter pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024) is not necessary because the Veteran will have an opportunity to submit additional evidence to be considered on remand, and this remand is not considered a final adjudication of the issue on appeal. 

Remand is warranted to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R ยง 20.802. In this case, the instant issues were granted in January 2025 rating decisions that implemented Board decisions. However, prior to the rating decisions being issued, the AOJ should have scheduled the Veteran for updated examinations to assess the severity of the claimed conditions.

For the issues of bilateral pes planus and left foot hallux valgus, the disabilities were last examined in December 2022. The Board notes that although the Veteran underwent a VA foot examination in June 2024, that examination only addressed the conditions of hammer toes, arthritis, hallux limitus, and plantar fibromatosis, and did not discuss the symptoms related to the Veteran's pes planus and/or hallux valgus. As such, given the length of time that had elapsed since the December 2022 examination, the AOJ should have scheduled the Veteran for an updated foot conditions examination prior to rating the disabilities.

Similarly, for the claim for a higher rating for a TBI, the Veteran was last examined in February 2024. However, at that examination, the VA examiner did not diagnose a TBI and therefore the findings from that examination are not necessarily based on correct facts. As such, the Veteran should have undergone an updated TBI examination prior to the disability being rated.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for examinations by appropriate clinicians to determine the current severity of the service-connected pes planus, left foot hallux valgus, and TBI. The examiner should provide a full description of the disabilities and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.  

2. Thereafter, readjudicate the issues on appeal.
