An effective date of May 31, 2007 for special monthly compensation (SMC) based on loss of use of a creative organ is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

The evidence of record reflects that the earliest date entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction and SMC for loss of use of a creative organ arose was May 31, 2007.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of May 31, 2007 but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.400, 3.2500.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of May 31, 2007 but no earlier, for the grant of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1973 to September 1976.

These matters were appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2023 rating decision through submission of a January 2024 VA Form 10182 with election of the direct review appeal docket. 

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. An effective date prior to October 19, 2016 for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction

2. An effective date prior to October 19, 2016 for the grant of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ

Legal Criteria

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Moreover, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(1).

A claim, either formal or informal, must be in writing to be considered a "claim" for benefits within the meaning of the law. See Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1999). A complete claim is required for all types of claims and will generally be considered filed as of the date it was received by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d). A claim may be filed by either the Veteran, or his duly appointed representative. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a-b).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments also, inter alia, eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. § 3.151, 3.155, 3.157.

Once a claim has been filed, VA will adjudicate as part of that claim entitlement to any other ancillary benefits that arise as a result of the adjudication of the claim such as, dependents' educational assistance (DEA) benefits, entitlement to SMC, entitlement to adaptive automobile allowance, etc. The claimant may, but need not, assert entitlement to ancillary benefits at the time the complete claim is filed. VA will also consider all lay and medical evidence of record in order to adjudicate entitlement to benefits for the claimed condition as well as entitlement to any additional benefits for complications of the claimed condition, including those identified by the rating criteria for that condition in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. VA's decision on a claim implies that all other issues reasonably raised within the scope of the enumerated claim have been addressed in the adjudication of that claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2).

Factual Background & Analysis 

The Veteran contends that the effective date for service connection for his erectile dysfunction as secondary to a service-connected lumbar spine disability should coincide with the date of a May 31, 2007 VA spine/neurological examination. See January 2024 VA Form 10182. 

By way of background, the Veteran has never submitted a formal claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction. The claims for service connection for erectile dysfunction and SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ were granted in a January 2023 rating decision following a July 2022 Board decision which remanded the issue of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ. The Board determined that the evidence reasonably raising this issue within the scope of an initial increased rating for a lumbar spine disability claim. 

In this case, the January 2023 rating decision granted an October 19, 2016 effective date for service connection for erectile dysfunction based on VA treatment records showing diagnosis and treatment for this disability. A review of the evidence shows that erectile dysfunction was diagnosed as early as a May 31, 2007 VA spine/neurological examination which noted erectile dysfunction as a symptom associated with a service-connected lumbar spine disability. This is the earliest date the evidence showed a diagnosis or indication of erectile dysfunction. 

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date for entitlement to service connection must be the "date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later." Here, the date of claim can be traced back to the June 24, 1997 initial claim for service connection for a lumbar spine disability. However, the date entitlement arose coincides with the earliest indication that erectile dysfunction was shown by the evidence which is the later date of May 31, 2007. Notably, this is the effective date of service connection argued for by the Veteran in the January 2024 VA Form 10182 and other submissions.

Accordingly, an effective date of May 31, 2007 but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction is warranted. This earlier effective date also applies to the issue of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ which is predicated on service connection being in effect for erectile dysfunction.
