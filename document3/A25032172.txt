REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a heart disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1990 to December 1995.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2022 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2022 decision. In April 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2022 decision.  

In the June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the only issue on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

After reviewing the evidence of record, and in light of Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the Board has recharacterized the issue of service connection for coronary artery disease to encompass any heart disability, as originally claimed by the Veteran in a September 2021 claim.

Entitlement to service connection for a heart disability.

A July 2021 VA treatment record reflects a diagnosis of CAD. Service treatment records (STRs) reflect repeated reports of chest pain. See, e.g., August 1992 STRs. Indeed, the Veteran's September 1995 separation report of medical history reflects a history of shortness of breath, sharp left chest pain, and palpitations off and on for three years. He was diagnosed with chest wall pain.

April 2014 private treatment records reflect that the Veteran had coronary artery bypass grafting in July 2014. Given the Veteran's diagnosis, symptoms in service, and symptoms after service, the Board finds that there are medical questions that remain outstanding and remand for a VA examination is warranted. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ should arrange for a VA examination of the Veteran to determine the nature and likely cause of any heart disability. The examiner should provide an opinion with detailed rationale that responds to the following:

(a.) Please identify, by diagnosis, all heart disabilities present.

(b.) For each heart disability diagnosed, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such disability was either incurred in or otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty service? Please explain why. The examiner should discuss STRs reflecting reports of chest pain, including the September 1995 separation report of medical history.
