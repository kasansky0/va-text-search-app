ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for hypertension is granted from June 29, 2012.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A claim for service connection for hypertension was received on January 31, 2012.  A November 2013 rating decision denied service connection for diabetes mellitus.  New and material evidence was received within one year of the rating decision.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension secondary to ischemic heart disease is established from June 29, 2012.

3. Hypertension has not more nearly approximate a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more that requires continuous medication for control, diastolic pressure 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date for service connection for service connection for hypertension are met from June 29, 2012.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

2.  The criteria for a compensable rating for service-connected hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1972 to September 1976.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on December 18, 2024.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Date Criteria

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increased, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a).  The effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran is the day following the date of discharge or release if the application therefor is received within one year from such date of discharge or release.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1).

A claim is defined as a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  The amendments apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by VA.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by VA, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  An intent to file a claim can be submitted in one of three ways, including a saved electronic application.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1). When an application otherwise meeting the requirements of this paragraph (b) is electronically initiated and saved in a claims-submission tool within a VA web-based electronic claims application system prior to filing of a complete claim, VA will consider that application to be an intent to file a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1)(i).

The Court has made it clear that the date of the filing of a claim is controlling in determinations as to effective dates.  A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a).

For continuously pursued claims, except as otherwise provided by other provisions of this part, including § 3.400, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision, provided that any appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must be accepted as timely by that court. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  Except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision or the Board issued notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

Service connection may be established on a presumptive basis for certain disabilities resulting from exposure to an herbicide agent.  Those diseases include diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, Public Law No.117-168 was enacted on August 10, 2022.  The PACT Act expanded veterans' disability benefits, including provisions relevant to claims for service connection for disabilities due to herbicide exposure.  The PACT Act expanded the presumption of exposure to herbicides to veterans who served at specified military bases in Thailand during the Vietnam era and added hypertension as a condition that is presumptively associated with herbicide exposure.  

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for hypertension 

A March 2023 rating decision granted service connection for hypertension from August 10, 2022.  The effective date was based on the date of enactment of the PACT Act, which expanded that presumption of herbicide exposure to veterans who served at Royal Thai air bases during the Vietnam era and added hypertension as a disability that is presumptively related to herbicide exposure.  The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for hypertension.  He contends that service connection is warranted on a direct basis prior to August 10, 2022.  

A claim for service connection for hypertension was initially received on January 31, 2012.  A November 2013 rating decision denied service connection for hypertension.  The Veteran submitted evidence within a year of the rating decision.  That evidence included a lay statement alleging that his military occupational specialty involved working on the perimeter at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base.   He alleged exposure to herbicides on the perimeter of the base.  

New and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim that was pending at the beginning of the appeal period.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  When evidence is added to the file within the appellate period, the finality of the decision is tolled until there has been a determination as to whether that evidence is new and material.  See Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1407 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2011).

The RO considered the evidence in a February 2015 rating decision continued to deny service connection for hypertension.  The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement with the rating decision in January 2016.  The AOJ did not issue an SOC in response to the notice of disagreement.  A May 2023 rating decision granted service connection for hypertension from August 10, 2022.  

The Board finds that the claim for service connection for hypertension was pending from January 31, 2012.  The provisions establishing hypertension as a presumptive disability related to Agent Orange under the PACT Act became effective on August 10, 2022. Therefore, presumptive service connection does not apply for hypertension prior to August 10, 2022.  Service connection may only be granted prior to August 10, 2022 on a direct basis.  

In this case, an earlier effective date is warranted for service connection for ischemic heart disease from June 29, 2012.  The evidence shows a causal relationship of ischemic heart disease and hypertension.  An October 2013 VA examination for hypertension noted that the Veteran reported he was diagnosed with hypertension in 1992 when he was admitted to hospital for cardiac catheterization and was taking medication for his hypertension.  Additionally, the July 2016 VA treatment records lists "hypertension/CAD" as one assessment or diagnosis.  The notation of the conditions as a combined diagnosis indicates that the conditions are considered related.  The Board considers the July 2016 VA treatment record as a medical nexus between hypertension and heart disease.  See Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record). Thus, the July 2016 treatment record is entitled to probative weight as to the relationship of hypertension and CAD.  The record does not contain any medical opinions relating hypertension directly to Agent Orange exposure, thus a direct causal relationship is not found between those two.  

However, there is sufficient evidence of a causal connection between the hypertension and the ischemic heart disease, which has been awarded an effective date of June 29, 2012, in a concurrent Board decision. Based on the laws involving effective dates, the earliest possible date for service connection for hypertension secondary to ischemic heart disease is June 29, 2012.

With regard to the date of entitlement to secondary service connection for hypertension the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation. However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. 

To this point, the Board notes that 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 states that the effective date for an award of service connection is the latter of the date of claim, or the date entitlement arose. In other words, when determining the appropriate effective date for an award of secondary service connection, the effective date of such an award cannot be earlier than the effective date of the award of service connection for the primary disability upon which the award of secondary service connection is predicated. Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 248 (2019). See also Roper v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 173, 180 (2006); affd 240 Fed. App. 422 (2007) ("The Court can find no evidence, persuasive or otherwise, that section 3.310(a) was intended to govern any element of disability benefit decision making other than the determination of service connection."); Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("Section 3.310(a) is concerned only with entitlement to service connection and is silent with respect to the proper effective date for service connection... Section 3.400, on the other hand, specifically addresses the proper effective date for claims for benefits.").

As an award of secondary service connection is based on a primary service-connected disability, the effective date for the award of secondary service connection cannot, as a matter of logic, predate the effective date for the award of service connection for the primary disability or disabilities. Delrio, supra. 

Therefore, the appropriate effective date for service connection for hypertension is June 29, 2012, which is the effective date for the award of ischemic heart disease, and it may not be any sooner.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Increased rating for hypertension  

Hypertension is rated under DC 7101. DC 7101 provides ratings for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  A 10 percent rating is warranted with diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; when an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is warranted with diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more or; systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  A 40 percent rating is warranted with diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more.  A 60 percent rating is warranted with diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.

Note (1): Hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days. For purposes of this section, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm.

Note (2): Evaluate hypertension due to aortic insufficiency or hyperthyroidism, which is usually the isolated systolic type, as part of the condition causing it rather than by a separate evaluation.

Note (3): Evaluate hypertension separately from hypertensive heart disease and other types of heart disease.

Where the criteria for a compensable rating under a diagnostic code are not met, and the schedule does not provide for a noncompensable rating, as in DC 7101, a noncompensable rating will be assigned when the required symptomatology for a compensable rating is not shown.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

VA has specifically contemplated the effects of medication as a factor to be considered when rating hypertension under DC 7101.  Any ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication are not discounted in the evaluation.  McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267 (2016).

In Wilson v. McDonough, the Court held "a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control" refers to blood pressure readings taken before a Veteran began medication to control hypertension, and therefore may require analyzing blood pressure readings prior to the period on appeal.  Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021).

The word "predominantly" is not defined in the rating schedule. Absent an express definition, it is presumed that VA regulations employ words using their ordinary dictionary meanings. "Predominantly" is defined as "for the most part," or "mainly."  See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 978 (11th ed. 2012).

The evidence shows that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in 1992 when he was admitted for a cardiac catheterization.  The record does not contain any blood pressure readings prior to 1992.

A review of blood pressure readings during the period since June 2012 reflects the following:

1/31/12:     138/78

2/14/12:     133/86

10/18/12:   137/80

1/29/13:     137/75

10/31/13:   135/73

10/31/13:   130/70

10/31/13:   129/77

1/10/14:     133/77

7/10/15:      139/76

7/10/15:      148/72

7/14/16:      170/81

8/15/16:      123/69

8/16/17:      154/76

8/30/18:      149/93

8/19/19:      145/84

3/18/20:      145/72

1/09/22:      114/72

8/19/22:      126/75

12/19/22:    102/69

As to the Veteran's diastolic pressure, the evidence of record reflects that there were no readings of diastolic pressure over 100.  As to the Veteran's systolic pressure, the evidence of record reflects one reading in July 2016 when the Veteran's systolic pressure was over 160.  Thus, even though the Veteran uses continuous medication for control, the evidence of record does not show a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, consistent with the term "predominant" meaning that that his blood pressure readings above the specified levels more often than below those levels.

The record does not contain lay evidence or testimony indicating a history of diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or greater or systolic blood pressure predominantly 160 or greater.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so as to whether the Veteran's hypertension warrants a compensable rating. Rather, the evidence weighs persuasively against the assignment of a compensable rating.  Accordingly, as the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, an initial compensable rating for hypertension must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
