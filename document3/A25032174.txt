ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire appellate period, hypertension required continuous use of medication for control, but is not manifested by diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or a history thereof, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable rating for service-connected hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from February 1971 to February 1993, including combat service in the Republic of Vietnam.  The Veteran's decorations include Combat Action Ribbon. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

As well, the Board is cognizant of the ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  In Rice, the Court held that a claim for a total rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disability, either expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record, involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability and is part of the claim for an increased rating.  In this case, the Veteran has not argued, and the record does not otherwise reflect, that the disability at issue renders him unemployable.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that a claim for TDIU has not been raised.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1

If a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when assigning disability ratings.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).  A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that may result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  The following analysis is undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different ratings may be warranted for different time periods.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a higher rating for hypertension.  See January 2024 VA Form 10182. 

Under DC 7101, a 60 percent rating is warranted for hypertension if the diastolic pressure is predominantly 130 or more; a 40 percent rating is assigned if the diastolic pressure is predominantly 120 or more; a 20 percent rating is warranted when the diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more; and a 10 percent rating is assigned if the diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more or systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more, or minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.

Notes to DC 7101 provide that hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.  For purposes of this section, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90 mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160 mm. or greater with a diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm.  Additionally, such direct that hypertension due to aortic insufficiency or hyperthyroidism, which is usually the isolated systolic type, should be evaluated as part of the condition causing it rather than by a separate evaluation.  Finally, hypertension should be evaluated separately from hypertensive heart disease and other types of heart disease.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for hypertension in February 2022.  At such time, high blood pressure was noted to have begun in 1994.  The examiner notes continuous medication for hypertension including Nifedipine, Hydralazine, Metoprolol.  The examiner reported the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic blood pressure of predominantly 100 or more.  The Veteran's blood pressure readings during the examination were 152/87, 156/88, and 161/89.  The examiner indicated that the hypertension did not have a functional impact on the Veteran's ability to work. 

Thereafter, the Veteran was afforded an additional VA examination in July 2023.  Current medications included Nifedipine 90 mg, Hydralazine 50 mg, Furosemide 20 mg, and Losarta.  The examiner reported the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic blood pressure of predominantly 100 or more.  The Veteran's blood pressure readings on the date of the VA examination were 140/72, 136/74, and 136/76.  There were no other pertinent findings related to the hypertension.  The examiner indicated that the hypertension did not have a functional impact on the Veteran's ability to work. 

Treatment records are consistent, overall, with these examinations.  Blood pressure readings are associated with the file from 1976 to September 2022.  None of the readings show diastolic readings over 100.  Regarding the systolic pressure, there is a reading from May 1993, which records his blood pressure as 160/94, and in February 1994, which records blood pressure as166/88.  The overall majority of the readings show below 160 for systolic pressure.  

The Board notes the Veteran's physician's assistant provided a letter in February 2023 along with his claim for hypertension.  The letter stated the Veteran has hypertension and takes multiple medication to control the blood pressure.  See February 2023 Integrated Medical Services Letter. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's hypertension is not warranted as the evidence shows that, while he requires continuous medication for control, he does not have diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or a history thereof, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.  In this regard, he had no readings of blood pressure with diastolic 100 or more, and only two readings at 160 or above for systolic pressure.  This is consistent with the two VA examinations.  Also, neither examiner felt there was a history of diastolic blood pressure of predominantly 100 or more.  The record is not indicative of diastolic blood pressure readings predominately over 100.  Rather, the evidence shows that all readings reflected that his diastolic blood pressure was under 100.  Furthermore, only two of the readings in the medical record show systolic blood pressure at 160 or more.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran takes medications for his hypertension, however, the use of medications is explicitly contemplated in DC 7101.  In this regard, the Court has held that the Board did not err in failing to discount the ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication as the plain language of DC 7101 contemplates the effects of medications.  McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 272-73 (2016).  Consequently, an initial compensable rating for hypertension is not warranted.

In making its determination in this case, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's belief that his hypertension is more severe than as reflected by the currently assigned rating.  However, his assertions are outweighed by the documented blood pressure readings as noted in the examinations and treatment record.

The Board has also considered whether staged ratings under Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999) are appropriate for the Veteran's service-connected hypertension; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology has been stable throughout the appeal period.  Therefore, assigning staged ratings for such disability is not warranted.

Therefore, the Board finds that a compensable rating for hypertension is not warranted.  In reaching such determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, the evidence is against the Veteran's claim.  Accordingly, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his rating claim must be denied.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is remanded.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a higher rating than his currently rated 10 percent disabling service-connected tinnitus.  See January 2024 VA Form 10182.

The Veteran was first diagnosed with tinnitus in a January 2022 VA examination.  The Veteran reported bilateral constant ringing.  The examiner noted the Veteran participated in combat activity in Vietnam and began noticing the tinnitus during the time of service.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2023 regarding his tinnitus.  The Veteran reported bilateral constant tinnitus.  The examiner noted the Veteran's tinnitus impacts ordinary conditions of daily life, including his ability to work.  

Critically, the examiner noted the Veteran's report that he gets aggravated and irritated because of the tinnitus.  The tinnitus makes it difficult for him to get sleep and if it was quiet around him it makes it difficult to concentrate.  See July 2023 VA examination. 

The Veteran's tinnitus is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6260.  Under DC 6260, tinnitus warrants a maximum 10 percent rating.

In Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162 (2019), the Court held that "VA has powerful, ready-made schedular rating tools with which it can better adjudicate claims that include symptoms and effects not contemplated by an applicable diagnostic code."  Morgan, 31 Vet. App. at 167; see also Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021); Long v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 167, 174 (2020) (en banc), vacated on other grounds sub nom. Long v. McDonough, 38 F.4th 1063 (Fed. Cir. 2022).

Pursuant to Morgan, the Board finds that it is essential to rate, on a schedular basis, all of the manifestations of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, in this case, to include insomnia, and any other manifestations of the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus.

The failure to investigate whether the Veteran has sleep or psychiatric manifestations due to his tinnitus constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  As such, on remand, a medical opinion should be obtained to determine any sleep disability or related psychiatric manifestations the Veteran may have and whether they are proximately due to his service-connected tinnitus.  Morgan, (explaining that VA's duty to maximize benefits may require it to consider secondary service connection as part of an increased rating claim).

In reaching this determination, the Board is aware than service connection is in effect for the Veteran's adjustment disorder and that the evaluation for that psychiatric disability is noncompensably disabling.  Here, however, the Board is tasked with rating the Veteran's tinnitus and he evidence suggests that sleep/psychiatric impairment may be a manifestation of that service-connected disability.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of his service-connected tinnitus.  

The examiner should provide a full description and manifestations of the disability.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Is the claimed sleep impairment and other psychiatric impairments related to or a manifestation of his service-connected tinnitus?

A diagnosis of insomnia must be ruled in or excluded.

The examiner must acknowledge and discuss the Veteran's competent statement regarding the manifestations of his tinnitus made during the July 2023 VA examination as reflected in the July 2023 VA examination report.
