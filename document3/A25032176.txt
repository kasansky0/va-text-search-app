ORDER

Entitlement to restoration of the Veteran's dependent child, M., to his award of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation, based on school attendance effective from February 16, 2014, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a March 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded a combined disability rating of at least 30 percent, effective September 20, 2011.

2. The Veteran's child, M., turned 18 years old in February 2014.

3. In April 2023, the Veteran first informed VA that M. was attending school from August 10, 2013, to June 5, 2014, graduating on June 11, 2014, and from August 15, 2014, to May 31, 2015.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for restoration of the Veteran's dependent child, M., to his award of VA disability compensation, based on school attendance effective from February 16, 2014, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 501, 1115, 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.57, 3.151, 3.401, 3.503, 3.667.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from August 1989 to May 1996. 

In September 2023, the Veteran requested Higher-Level Review (HLR) of an original August 2023 decision that denied restoration of the Veteran's dependent child, M., to his award of VA disability compensation, based on school attendance. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) adjudicated the HLR claim in a September 2023 decision. In October 2023, the Veteran appealed the September 2023 HLR decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ. Under direct review, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of the date of the original August 2023 decision.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

INCREASED RATE FOR DEPENDENTS

Veterans who have service-connected disabilities rated as 30 percent disabling and higher may be entitled to additional compensation for dependents. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(2). Here, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have been rated at least 30 percent since September 2011. As such, the threshold criteria of a minimum 30 percent disability rating for basic entitlement to additional payment for dependents has been met since September 2011. 38 U.S.C. § 1115.

When determining the effective date for an award of additional compensation for dependents, the effective date will be the last of the following dates: (1) the date of claim; (2) the date the dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the Veteran's award. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).

Additionally, a child is defined as an unmarried person who is (i) under the age of 18 years; (ii) before the age of 18 years became permanently incapable of self-support; or (iii) after attaining the age of 18 years and until completion of education or training (but not after attaining the age of 23 years) is pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution. 38 U.S.C. § 101(4)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.57(a). The allowance is generally discontinued when a dependent child turns 18, or when the child turns 23 if he or she is enrolled in school. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.503, 3.667.

Pension or compensation may be paid from a child's 18th birthday based on school attendance if the child was at that time pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution and a claim for such benefits is filed within one year from the child's 18th birthday. 38 C.F.R. § 3.667(a)(1). Pension or compensation based upon a course of instruction at an approved educational institution which was begun after a child's 18th birthday may be paid from the commencement of the course if a claim is filed within one year from that date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.667(a)(2).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a), a specific claim must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The Secretary has authority to prescribe the nature and extent of the proof required in order to establish a right to VA benefits. See 38 U.S.C. § 501.

Entitlement to restoration of the Veteran's dependent child, M., to his award of VA disability compensation, based on school attendance effective from February 16, 2014.

The Board has reviewed the evidence and finds that entitlement to restoration of the Veteran's dependent child, M., to his award of VA disability compensation, based on school attendance effective from February 16, 2014, is warranted.

In a March 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for lumbar spine invertebral disc disease (IVDS) with degenerative disc disease, which resulted in a combined disability rating of at least 30 percent, effective September 20, 2011. In light of this grant, in March 2023 correspondence, the Veteran was notified that retroactive benefits for his current dependents including, M. were being awarded effective from September 20, 2011. Additionally, he was notified that M. was removed from his award effective February 16, 2014, due to being over the age of 18 and not attending school. 

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-674 Request for Approval of School Attendance, stating that M. attended school for the period from August 10, 2013, to June 5, 2014, and graduated on June 11, 2014. Additionally, he submitted a second VA Form 21-674 stating that M. attended school for the period from August 15, 2014, to May 31, 2015.

In an August 2023 decision, VA notified the Veteran that his request to restore M. to his award based on prior school attendance could not be processed because more than one year had passed since the start of semesters listed on the submitted applications and that because M. is now over the age of 23, M. could no longer be considered a school child for VA purposes. 

In September 2023, the Veteran requested Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the August 2023 decision, and in the subsequent September 2023 HLR decision, the AOJ again determined that the request for dependency benefits based on school attendance could not be processed because more than one year had passed since the start of the semesters listed on the submitted applications as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.401. 

The Board concludes that the evidence supports a finding of restoration of the Veteran's dependent child, M., to his award of VA disability compensation, based on school attendance effective from February 16, 2014. As noted above, 38 C.F.R. § 3.667(a)(2) provides that compensation based upon school attendance which was begun after a child's 18th birthday may be paid from the commencement of the course if a claim is filed within one year from that date. Id. However, when determining the effective date for an award of additional compensation for dependents, 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b) provides that the effective date will be the last of the following dates: (1) the date of claim; (2) the date the dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the Veteran's award. Id. Thus, as under 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b)(3) the Veteran provided evidence of dependency based on school attendance within a year of the March 2023 rating decision that awarded the qualifying disability rating, the effective date in the present case should be the effective date of the qualifying disability, September 20, 2011, including any periods of dependency based on school attendance. Thus, although the AOJ awarded retroactive dependency benefits for M. effective from September 20, 2011, the Board finds that M. was improperly removed from the award effective February 16, 2014, because evidence of continued dependency based upon school attendance was properly provided within one year of the March 2023 rating decision that awarded the Veteran's qualifying disability rating as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b)(3). Therefore, the Board finds that entitlement to restoration of the Veteran's dependent child, M., to his award of VA disability compensation, based on school attendance effective from February 16, 2014, has been established. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of the claim of entitlement to restoration of the Veteran's dependent child, M., to his award of VA disability compensation, based on school attendance effective from February 16, 2014. Therefore, the appeal in this regard is granted.
