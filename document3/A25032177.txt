ORDER

Eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees to the appellant from benefits resulting from the March 2024 grant of past-due benefits is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. The August 2023 and October 2023 Rating Decisions, which, respectively, granted service connection for coronary artery disease (CAD), assigning a rating of 10 percent from January 30, 2023 and service connection for bilateral hearing loss and assigned a rating of noncompensable from January 30, 2023, and denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for CAD, are the initial decisions on the claim for those benefits.

2. The appellant filed a relevant Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Supplemental Claim in October 2023, resulting in the March 2024 grant of 30 percent rating for CAD, effective March 6, 2023, and a 10 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss, effective March 6, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees to the appellant from benefits resulting from the 2024 grant of past-due benefits have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1971 to June 1973. The appellant is the Veteran's current attorney, except that he does not represent him in this appeal.

The fee decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision of the issue of attorney fees; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. On a March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Pursuant to contested claims procedures, a redacted copy of the appellant's substantive appeal was sent to the Veteran's address on file, and docketing letters dated May 2024 and July 2024 were sent to the Veteran and to the appellant.

Payment of Attorney Fees

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (a).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g)(1), all fee agreements must include the name of the Veteran, the applicable VA file number, and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g)(2). A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g)(3). Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (e), (f).

When a claimant and an agent or attorney have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the agent or attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether or not the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant, the total fee payable to the agent or attorney may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d); 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(1). Under VA regulations, such award of past-due benefits must result in a cash payment to a claimant or an appellant from which the fee may be deducted. Id. 

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a claim reopened after a denial by a VA AOJ or the Board or the lump-sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award, as determined by applicable laws and regulations, and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(1).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the reopened claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased evaluation is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability evaluation initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(1)(i).

Eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees to the appellant from benefits resulting from the March 2024 grant of past-due benefits

Under the AMA, agents or attorneys may charge claimants fees for representation once:

"	the agent or attorney has complied with regulatory power of attorney (POA) and fee agreement requirements.

"	an AOJ has issued notice of an initial decision on a claim, and

"	the initial decision was on a claim on or after February 19, 2019 (the effective date of the modernized decision review system). See 38 C.F.R. § 14.631; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g).

An "initial decision on a claim" is the result of a valid appeal. It includes an initial decision on a request to revise a prior decision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE); a decision on an initial claim for an increase in rate of benefit; or, as relevant to this appeal, an initial decision on a supplemental claim that was submitted after the final adjudication of an earlier claim. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (c)(1)(i).

In this case, the appellant is eligible for the direct payment of attorney fees to the appellant from benefits resulting from the March 2024 grant of past-due benefits. Specifically, the pre-decisional evidence of record shows that the requirements for withholding of attorney fees for the appellant have been met. See Cox v. McDonough, 4 Vet. App. 112 (2021).

First, the appellant complied with the regulatory POA and fee agreement requirements. Specifically, he executed a valid VA Form 21-22a in January 2023. The claimants' Fee Agreement was also executed and filed in January 2023. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d)(2), the Fee Agreement provides for direct payment of 20 percent of past-due benefits.

Second, the AOJ granted increased rating benefits for CAD and for bilateral hearing loss based on a Supplemental Claim filed by the appellant. Specifically, in an August 2023 Rating Decision, the AOJ granted service connection for coronary artery disease (CAD), assigning a rating of 10 percent from January 30, 2023 and service connection for bilateral hearing loss and assigned a rating of noncompensable from January 30, 2023.  In an October 2023 Rating Decision, the AOJ denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for CAD.  

After retaining the appellant, the Veteran, through the appellant, submitted VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application in October 2023. Along with this application, the appellant submitted evidence of entitlement to increased ratings for CAD and for bilateral hearing loss. In March 2024, the AOJ issued an AMA Rating Decision assigning a 30 percent rating for CAD effective March 6, 2023 and a 10 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss, also effective March 6, 2023.

While the March 2024 fee decision indicates the absence of a request for benefits that qualifies the appellant to receive fees, the October 2023 Supplemental Claim form claiming increased ratings for CAD and bilateral hearing loss is indeed a qualifying request for benefits, as a result of which benefits were granted. Accordingly, the Board finds that attorney fees are warranted for these two benefits in the amount specified in the January 2023 Fee Agreement.

In so ruling, the Board reiterates that in light of the Federal Circuit's decision in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Vet. Aff., 7 F.4 th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021), the Federal Circuit found invalid 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (c)(1)(i)'s limitation of attorney fees in supplemental claims to only when the supplemental claim had been filed within one year of the prior rating decision. The Federal Circuit explained that a supplemental claim can be considered part of the same case as the initial rating decision, regardless of when the supplemental claim is filed. The Federal Circuit stated, "Just as a CUE claim belongs to the same 'case' as a [V]eteran's original claim for benefits, thereby permitting paid representation for work performed after an AOJ's initial decision, so too does a... supplemental claim seeking the 'same or similar benefits on the same or similar basis as the original claim." Id. at 65.  Even were the claims not submitted on VA Form 20-0995, and just on VA Form 21-8940, the appellant would still be eligible for the direct payment of fees.  Indeed, recent case law holding that a supplemental claim is any complete claim for a VA benefit on an application form prescribed by the Secretary where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(2). A supplemental claim need not be filed on a specific VA form. See Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *16-*20 (March 13, 2025).

In this case, the appellant's October 2023 Supplemental Claim for increased ratings for CAD and bilateral hearing loss is part of the same case as the denials in adverse August 2023 and October 2023 Rating Decisions, and ultimately resulted in the March 2024 initial AMA decision awarding increased ratings for the same benefits-that is, a 30 percent rating for CAD effective March 6, 2023 and a 10 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss, also effective March 6, 2023, there is no question that direct payment of the attorney fees specified in the Fee Agreement is warranted as to those two benefits.
