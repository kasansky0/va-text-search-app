ORDER

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for low back condition is dismissed.

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

In a February 2022 correspondence, prior to promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran explicitly, unambiguously, and with a full understanding of the consequences withdrew his appeal for the issues of entitlement to service connection for low back condition, and entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran and for entitlement to service connection for low back condition have been met.? 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.? 

2. The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran and for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met.? 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.? 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 2016 to April 2017, including service in the Persian Gulf from June to September 2016 and from November 2016 to February 2017, as well as in Afghanistan from September to November 2016.  

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the May 2021 and June 2021 rating decisions issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the May 2021 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for low back condition and deferred a decision for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  

In the June 2021 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. 

In the January 2022 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed the RO's May 2021 and June 2021 rating decisions and elected the Hearing docket.  

In a February 2022 correspondence, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran explicitly and unambiguously withdrew the January 2022 VA Form 10182, explaining that the Veteran wished to submit additional evidence and pursue his February 2022 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim, in lieu of an appeal to the Board.  

1. The appeal of entitlement to service connection for low back condition is dismissed.

2. The appeal of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. §?7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 U.S.C. §?20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. §?20.205. 

An effective?withdrawal?of a claim on appeal must be in writing, include the name of the veteran (or claimant or appellant if other than the veteran), the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Hembree v. Wilkie,?33?Vet. App.?1, 5-7?(2020);?38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the?withdrawal?must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  Hembree at 5. 

Here, in January 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, appealing the issues of entitlement to service connection for low back condition denied in the May 2021 rating decision, and entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea denied in the June 2021 rating decision.  

In February 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim VA regarding the same issues.  In addition, in the February 2022 correspondence, the Veteran requested to have his appeal cancelled, requesting to submit additional evidence and pursue a supplemental claim.  

The AMA prohibits such concurrent election of claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). To rectify the matter, the Veteran submitted the February 2022 correspondence indicating that he wished to withdraw his appeal to the Board and have the AOJ adjudicate his February 2022 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim.

Accordingly, the Board finds, in the February 2022 correspondence, the Veteran stated that he would like to withdraw his claim from the Board.  The statement is in writing, includes the name of the Veteran, the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn, thereby satisfying the requirements of a proper withdrawal as expressed in the February 2022 correspondence.  

In light of the foregoing, there remains no allegations of error or fact or law for appellate consideration with regard to the issues of entitlement to service connection for low back condition and entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea and the issues must be dismissed.  See 38 C.F.R. §?20.205; Hembree, 33 Vet. App. at 5-7; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).
