ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for right hip osteoarthritis based on limitation of flexion under Diagnostic Code 5252 is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right hip osteoarthritis based on limitation of extension under Diagnostic Code 5251 is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right hip osteoarthritis based on impairment of the thigh under Diagnostic Code 5253 is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The right knee rating issue is not currently before the Board and under the circumstances of this case, the right hip osteoarthritis is appropriately rated as limitation of motion of the affected joint; Diagnostic Code 5002 is not for application. 

2. The Veteran's right hip osteoarthritis is not manifested by flexion limited to 30 degrees. 

3. The Veteran's right hip osteoarthritis is not manifested by extension limited to 5 degrees. 

4. The Veteran's right hip osteoarthritis is not manifested by limitation of adduction, cannot cross legs; or limitation of rotation, cannot toe-out right leg more than 15 degrees. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial rating greater than 10 percent for right hip osteoarthritis based on limitation of flexion have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252.

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for right hip osteoarthritis based on limitation of extension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5251.

3. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for right hip osteoarthritis based on impairment of the thigh have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1966 to February 1968. 

In November 2023, the Board denied an initial rating greater than 10 percent for right hip osteoarthritis under Diagnostic Code 5252; denied an initial compensable rating for the right hip under Diagnostic Code 5251; denied an initial compensable rating for the right hip under Diagnostic Code 5253; denied an initial rating greater than 10 percent for left knee strain; denied an initial compensable rating for hypertension; and remanded entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for right knee osteoarthritis. The Veteran appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). 

By Order dated in November 2024, the Court granted a joint motion for partial remand (joint motion) thereby vacating that part of the Board's November 2023 decision that denied initial increased ratings for the right hip under Diagnostic Codes 5251, 5252, and 5253. The appellant did not challenge that portion of the decision which denied initial increased ratings for left knee strain and hypertension and those issues were dismissed. The Court lacked jurisdiction over the remanded issue.

By letter dated in December 2024, the Board notified the Veteran that he had the opportunity, if desired, to submit additional argument (not evidence) within 90 days of the date of the letter. The letter further advised that his case would be reviewed under the same option as he initially chose on his VA Form 10182. The Veteran's representative was copied on this letter but did not submit an informal hearing presentation. In January 2025, the Veteran submitted a statement referencing the brief filed at the Court and indicating he did not have additional argument to submit and waived any remaining time to do so. The Board honors the Veteran's request and waiver and proceeds to adjudicate the case.

The Veteran elected the evidence submission docket on his July 2023 VA Form 10182. Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Neither the Veteran nor representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist. See Scott v McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to duty to assist argument).

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (rating schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Disability ratings are intended to compensate impairment in earning capacity due to a service-connected disorder. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. 

VA regulations set forth at 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59 provide for consideration of functional impairment due to pain on motion when evaluating the severity of a musculoskeletal disability. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that a higher rating can be based on "greater limitation of motion due to pain on use." DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206 (1995). Any such functional loss must be "supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior of the claimant." 38 C.F.R. § 4.40.  

Although pain may cause a functional loss, pain itself does not constitute functional loss. Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Pain must affect some aspect of "the normal working movements of the body" such as "excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," in order to constitute functional loss. Id.; 38 C.F.R. § 4.40. Mitchell, DeLuca, and §§ 4.40 and 4.45 do not require the assignment of a higher schedular disability rating where the functional limitation due to pain does not result in limitation of motion sufficient to meet the requirements of the next higher disability rating. Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785-86 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding that §§ 4.40 and 4.45 do not supersede the requirements for a higher disability rating specified in § 4.71a).

The requirement of ankylosis can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis (i.e., functional immobility of the joint) during a flare-up. Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

1. Entitlement to initial increased ratings for right hip osteoarthritis 

In June 2023, VA granted service connection for right hip osteoarthritis (limitation of flexion, 10 percent; limitation of extension, noncompensable; and thigh impairment, noncompensable). All ratings were effective May 15, 2023. The Veteran appealed the ratings. The appeal period for review is from the effective date of service connection (May 15, 2023 to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal. 

Pursuant to the joint motion, the parties agreed that the Board erred by providing an inadequate statement of reasons or bases. Specifically, that the Board failed to discuss whether the Veteran's right hip and knee arthritis warrants a rating under Diagnostic Code 5002 rather than the ratings currently assigned under Diagnostic Codes 5251, 5252, 5253, 5260 and 5261.

Multi-joint arthritis (except post-traumatic and gout), 2 or more joints, as an active process is rated as follows: one or two exacerbations a year in a well-established diagnosis (20 percent); symptom combinations productive of definite impairment of health objectively supported by examination findings or incapacitating exacerbations occurring 3 or more times a year (40 percent); less than the criteria for 100 percent but with weight loss and anemia productive of severe impairment of health or severely incapacitating exacerbations occurring 4 or more times a year or a lesser number over prolonged periods (60 percent); and with constitutional manifestations associated with active joint involvement, totally incapacitating (100 percent). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5002. 

Note (1) to this provision provides that examples of conditions rated using this diagnostic code include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and spondyloarthropathies. Note (2) indicates that chronic residuals are rated under Diagnostic Code 5003; and Note (3) indicates that the ratings for the active process will not be combined with the residual ratings for limitation of motion, ankylosis, or Diagnostic Code 5003. Instead, assign the higher evaluation. Id. 

The Board acknowledges the argument presented in the appellant's brief to the Court that the Veteran's right hip and right knee osteoarthritis satisfies the element of "multi-joint arthritis (that was not post-traumatic or gout) in 2 or more joints" and that a 40 percent rating is warranted under Diagnostic Code 5002.See appellant's brief filed at the Court in July 2024. For the reasons given below, the Board finds that it cannot assign a rating under this diagnostic code. 

First, the Board is at a loss as to how it can consider the right knee rating issue. While the joint motion directs consideration of the right knee in tandem with the right hip, it also states, "The Court lacks jurisdiction over [the initial rating right knee] claim. See Breeden v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 475, 478 (2004) (Court lacks jurisdiction over claim remanded by BVA)." In its November 2023 decision, the Board remanded the issue of entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for right knee osteoarthritis. In September 2024, VA readjudicated the right knee claim and the Veteran appealed that decision under a separate docket number. In March 2025, the Board remanded the right knee rating issue under the separate docket number. Under these circumstances, the Board's consideration is limited to the right hip, as the Court did not have jurisdiction to remand the issue of an initial rating greater than 10 percent for right knee osteoarthritis. 

Second, the Board acknowledges the argument that the list at Note (1) is not exhaustive and that because the Veteran's right knee and hip osteoarthritis is not post-traumatic or gout, that it is a condition contemplated for inclusion within Diagnostic Code 5002. The Board disagrees. That is, while the right hip and right knee are clearly 2 separate joints, the Board does not consider this to be multi-joint arthritis as contemplated in the referenced diagnostic code. 

As part of the regulatory amendments effective February 7, 2021, VA proposed to retitle this diagnostic code as multi-joint arthritis, versus rheumatoid arthritis, "to include a greater number of systemic arthritis processes that cause multisystem effects besides rheumatoid arthritis." See 82 Fed. Reg. 35719, 35720 (August 1, 2017) (emphasis added). The Board observes that the non-exhaustive list at Note (1) is based on Kelley's Textbook of Rheumatology (10th ed. 2017). Id. Further, the listed conditions relate to rheumatic and/or systemic disorders. 

The June 2023 examiner diagnosed right hip osteoarthritis. While listed as an option, the examiner did not diagnosis "arthritis, rheumatoid (multi-joints)". Review of the medical evidence shows the Veteran has degenerative joint disease localized to the specific joint. Indeed, the June 2023 VA hip examiner cited medical literature indicating that "[o]steoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage, which is the protective tissue covering the ends of bones within a joint. In the case of osteoarthritis in the right hip, the cartilage in the hip joint on the right side has undergone significant wear and tear, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion." The medical evidence simply does not show that the right hip arthritis affects other organs or causes multisystem effects. 

The appellant's own brief indicates there is "objective proof of localized pain" and cites to limitation of motion and associated functional impairment. While the brief argues that osteoarthritis is a systemic arthritis, the appellant does not point to any multisystem effects (e.g., beyond the hip joint), and the general assertion does not outweigh the probative VA opinion of record. To the extent the appellant's brief cites to medical literature in support of this contention, this is evidence, as opposed to argument, received outside the evidentiary windows and is not for consideration.

Finally, the Board observes that if a 40 percent rating were assigned under Diagnostic Code 5002 as requested by the Veteran, then under Note (3), the compensable ratings currently assigned under Diagnostic Codes 5252 and 5260 based on limitation of motion would have to be terminated as they cannot be combined with ratings for the active process. This would not result in a net increase as the ratings currently assigned under these provisions combine to 21 percent. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.25, 4.26. 

Pursuant to the rating schedule, degenerative arthritis will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved (DC 5200 etc.). See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003. While Diagnostic Code 5200 is referenced as a potentially "appropriate" code, the Board again finds that to relate to degenerative arthritis as part of a systemic arthritis process and not to osteoarthritis localized to a specific joint. Under the circumstances of this case, the Board finds that the right hip is appropriately rated based on limitation of motion. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5251, a maximum 10 percent rating is warranted for extension of the thigh limited to 5 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5251. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5252, a 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 20 degrees. A maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5253, a 10 percent rating is warranted for limitation of rotation of affected leg, cannot toe out more than 15 degrees. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for limitation of adduction, cannot cross legs. A maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of abduction, motion lost beyond 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.

On VA hip and thigh examination in June 2023, the Veteran reported constant aching pain and muscle spasm. He uses over-the-counter Tylenol, ice packs, and heating pads. He has had 5 to 6 injections to help alleviate the pain. Diagnosis was right hip osteoarthritis. The Veteran reported that he feels pain after walking more than 10 minutes and VA provided a cane. He described daily flare-ups which are severe and last 15 to 20 minutes. Range of motion of the right hip was flexion to 115 degrees; extension to 20 degrees; abduction to 30 degrees; adduction to 20 degrees; external rotation to 50 degrees; and internal rotation to 30 degrees. There was pain with all range of motion. Limitation of adduction did not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs. Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion. There was evidence of pain with weightbearing and in active and passive motion. There was crepitus but no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing with no additional loss of function or range of motion. Procured evidence suggests that pain would limit functional ability with repeated use over time. In terms of range of motion, this was estimated as flexion to 115 degrees; extension to 15 degrees; abduction to 25 degrees; adduction to 15 degrees; external rotation to 45 degrees; and internal rotation to 30 degrees. Procured evidence also suggests that pain would significantly limit functional ability with flare-ups. In terms of range of motion, this was estimated as flexion to 115 degrees; extension to 15 degrees; abduction to 25 degrees; adduction to 20 degrees; external rotation to 45 degrees; and internal rotation to 25 degrees. Limitation in adduction after repeated use and with flare-ups does not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs. There was no muscle atrophy or ankylosis on the right. There was no malunion or nonunion of the femur, flail hip joint, or leg length discrepancy on the right. The Veteran uses a cane constantly.

On review, the AOJ assigned the minimum compensable 10 percent evaluation under Diagnostic Code 5252 (limitation of flexion) based on painful motion pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. There is no evidence of flexion limited to 30 degrees and a rating greater than 10 percent is not warranted under this diagnostic code. 

A 10 percent rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5251 as there is no evidence of extension limited to 5 degrees. 

A compensable rating is also not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5253 based on impairment of the right thigh as there is no evidence of limitation of adduction such that the Veteran cannot cross his legs; or limitation of rotation such that he cannot toe out more than 15 degrees.

In making these determinations, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports of pain. The Veteran's complaints of painful right hip motion are contemplated in the 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5252 and to assign an additional 10 percent rating based on painful extension would result in impermissible pyramiding. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. 

The Board also acknowledges the Veteran's reports of functional loss. However, the Board does not find adequate pathology to support higher ratings under any of the assigned diagnostic codes based on functional impairment due to pain on motion or other factors. The Veteran's complaints do not rise to the functional equivalent of ankylosis. Indeed, even considering the limitation in functional ability due to pain following repetitive use and with flare-ups, the estimated limitation of motion remains noncompensable and there is no suggestion of an inability to move the joint. 

Finally, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's use of injections and Tylenol to help alleviate his hip pain. While medications are arguably beneficial and the Veteran indicated that flare-ups are alleviated by medications, the Veteran continues to report constant aching pain in the right hip. The VA examination indicated there was pain in all planes of motion and there is no indication the measurements would be significantly different when discounting the effects of medication. 

In summary, the weight of the persuasive evidence is against the claim for increase and the doctrine-of-reasonable-doubt is not for application. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The claim is denied.
