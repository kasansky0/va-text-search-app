2. The Veteran's claim for a TDIU during the appeal period was raised on March 6, 2018.

3. The most probative and persuasive evidence reflects that the Veteran has been unable to secure or maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities prior to March 6, 2018.

4. Given the Board's decision herein, the Veteran's permanent and total disability status is established from March 6, 2018.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria are met to establish an earlier effective date for a TDIU rating from March 6, 2018. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400, 4.16.

2. The criteria are met for eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 from March 6, 2018. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 5110; 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1983 to November 1986.

In August 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (Appeals Modernization Act or AMA), Pub. Law 115-55, which created a new claims and appeals process for pursuing VA benefits. All initial rating decisions issued after February 19, 2019, are promulgated under the AMA. The rating decision preceding this appeal is a Higher-Level Review (HLR) decision issued in May 2021 following a March 2021 HLR Request in response to a March 2020 rating decision (the rating decision on appeal). Thus, the March 2020 rating decision constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the AMA applies.

In his timely July 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence docket. By law, for claims appealed in this docket, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2020 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, then, by law, the Board was not permitted to consider that evidence in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding a portion of this claim, any evidence not considered here will be considered by the AOJ on remand. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 10, 2019, for the award of TDIU

Legal Criteria

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If the claim is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date will be the date following separation from service, or the date entitlement arose (whichever is later). 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). In the context of a claim for service connection, the date of entitlement hinges on when the service-connected disability first manifested itself under all facts found. See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

Because a claim for TDIU is essentially a claim for an increased disability rating, effective date regulations for TDIU claims include the one-year "look-back" period. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009); Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000). 

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran originally submitted a VA Form 21-8940 (Application for Increased Compensation Based Upon Unemployability) seeking TDIU in April 2007. In a September 2007 rating decision, the AOJ denied his claim. The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and no new and material evidence was received during the subsequent year; thus, the rating decision became final.

On March 6, 2018, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim for Compensation (ITF), which was followed by a March 1, 2019, VA Form 21-526EZ Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, seeking-among other claims-increased ratings for certain service-connected disabilities. Rating decisions adjudicating these claims were issued in June 2019 and July 2019, therein denying all but one of the increased rating claims.

During the appeal period following the June 2019 and July 2019 rating decisions, the Veteran submitted a second VA Form 21-8940, as well as a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim, on November 25, 2019, seeking TDIU. In the March 2020 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ again denied the Veteran's claim. In March 2021 the Veteran filed a VA 20-0996 HLR Request appealing this decision. In the May 2021 HLR decision preceding this appeal, the AOJ granted TDIU effective July 10, 2019, which is the day after the date the Veteran claimed on his VA Form 21-8940 that he last worked and became too disabled to work due to service-connected disabilities.

At the time of the rating decision on appeal the Veteran had a 70 percent combined evaluation for compensation for seven service connected disabilities, including: (1) major depressive disorder (MDD) (50 percent from 07/21/2010); (2) hiatal hernia (10 percent from 07/21/2010); (3) right ankle sprain (10 percent from 11/11/1986); (4) right knee meniscal tear (10 percent from 03/06/2018); (5) right foot injury (10 percent from 07/21/2010; 20 percent from 03/06/2018; and 10 percent from 02/27/2020); and (6)-(7) residual right knee and ankle scars (noncompensable). Currently, the Veteran has an 80 percent combined evaluation for compensation, as he was subsequently granted service connection for residuals of prostate cancer with erectile dysfunction (40 percent from 08/01/2023).

Thus, the Veteran met the criteria for a schedular TDIU rating prior to July 10, 2019, as he obtained a 70 percent combined evaluation when he was awarded a 10 percent rating effective March 6, 2018, for his right knee meniscal tear. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Therefore, the Board need only consider whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable prior to July 10, 2019.

Following his active-duty service, the Veteran worked in the HVAC industry until his disabilities rendered him unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment. The Veteran's November 2019 VA Form 21-8940 states that his service-connected disabilities affected his full-time employment beginning July 9, 2009 (box 14), but that July 9, 2019, was the date he last worked full-time and became too disabled to work (boxes 15 and 16). Based on this reporting, the AOJ assigned July 10, 2019, as the effective date for TDIU. 

The Veteran submitted a statement in support of his Board appeal claiming that the July 9, 2019, date entered in boxes 15 and 16 was an error, and that he meant to list July 9, 2009, as he did for box 14. See July 2021 VA Form 21-4138. 

This statement is congruent with the remainder of the evidence. In a separate statement submitted along with his November 2019 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran noted that he has been unable to work since July 2009 due to his disabilities. See November 2019 Correspondence. Further, a Social Security Administration (SSA) earnings record for 2005-2009 reflects that the Veteran had no taxable income in 2009. See June 2021 SSA Statement. A March 2010 SSA Notice of Award advises that the Veteran was determined to be "disabled" beginning July 8, 2008, and became entitled to monthly disability benefits from January 2009. His primary diagnosis entitling him to SSA disability benefits was depressive disorder, for which the Veteran is service connected. See SSA Disability Determination. In addition, a November 2020 VA examination report for mental disorders noted that the Veteran stated that the last time he worked was 2009.

VA examination reports from April 2019 closely mirror the February 2020 VA examination reports which the AOJ relied on in granting TDIU, finding that the Veteran's disabilities impact his ability to work. See April 2019 VA Examinations (ankle, foot, and knee). His symptoms have specifically limited his ability to walk and stand due to pain, discomfort, weakness, instability, stiffness, and swelling, which are exacerbated by daily flare-ups. Id. The Veteran requires the constant use of a right knee brace and occasional use of a walker due to his right knee, ankle, and foot disabilities. Id. Further, the Veteran's functional impairment has rendered him unable to perform yardwork and he has difficulty completing basic household tasks (cleaning, laundry, making the bed, etc.). Id.

The Veteran has also sought and received extensive treatment for his service-connected disabilities since separating from the military, including numerous surgeries and hospitalizations. See VA Medical Records. 

The Board finds that the most probative and persuasive evidence of record reflects that from March 6, 2018, and continuing thereafter, the Veteran has been unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities. There is no information contrary to this finding in the medical records, SSA records, or lay testimony.

Therefore, the effective date of the Veteran's TDIU rating should be the later of: (1) the date the Veteran became unemployable due to service-connected disabilities; and (2) the date a claim for TDIU was raised. In this case, the TDIU claim was raised as part and parcel of the increased ratings claim filed on March 1, 2019. See Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 452. However, as the ITF preceding this claim was received by VA on March 6, 2018, the operative "claim" date is the ITF date. Because the evidence reflects that the Veteran became unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities as early as 2009, March 6, 2018, would be the latter of the two dates.

For the reasons discussed below, the issue of an earlier effective date for TDIU has been partially bifurcated, as the matter of an earlier effective date during the one-year "look back" period (i.e., from March 6, 2017, to March 5, 2018) has been remanded. 

Accordingly, an earlier effective date of March 6, 2018, is warranted for the Veteran's TDIU rating. To this extent, the Veteran's appeal is granted.

The Board notes that as part of its duty to afford the Veteran the maximum amount of benefits to which he is entitled, it considered whether special monthly compensation (SMC) could be awarded. While entitlement to SMC has not been explicitly raised by the Veteran, SMC based on statutory housebound criteria is part and parcel of any increased rating claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008); Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 251 (2011).

Such an award is warranted where a single service-connected disability rated as total (or a single service-connected disability with a TDIU rating where the schedular rating is less than total ) and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities, is permanently housebound. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). Here, the Veteran does not have a single service-connected disability for which TDIU can be awarded where the remaining service-connected disabilities would equal 60 percent. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.352, 4.16(a). Thus, SMC on this basis is not warranted under the current facts. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 10, 2019, for basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status

Basic eligibility to DEA exists if a veteran has a permanent, total service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501. A total disability may be assigned where the veteran's service-connected disabilities are rated 100 percent disabling under the rating schedule, or if the veteran is unemployable due to service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341. Permanence of total disability will be taken to exist when such impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(b). 

In the May 2021 HLR decision, the AOJ granted DEA (Chapter 35 benefits) with a July 10, 2019, effective date based on the TDIU rating established on that date. 

For the reasons discussed above, the Veteran has been unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities since at least March 6, 2018, the earlier effective date awarded herein for his TDIU rating.

Therefore, the Veteran is eligible for DEA benefits prior to July 10, 2019, and an earlier effective date of March 6, 2018, must be granted as a matter of law. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 6, 2018, for the award of TDIU is remanded

As discussed above, the appeal period for consideration includes the one-year "look back" period from the March 6, 2018, receipt of the Veteran's ITF under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). As such, the Board's analysis of the appealed issue includes a two-step process of considering (1) whether any of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities worsened during the one-year "look back" period, and if so, (2) whether the criteria for TDIU are met at any time during this period.

The medical evidence clearly indicates a worsening of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities during the one-year "look back" period between March 2017 and March 2018. Significantly, the Veteran required right knee surgery during this time, which was performed on January 10, 2018. See 03/07/2018 VA Orthopedic Surgery Note. Further, a November 2017 orthopedic consultation for right knee pain noted the Veteran "has had pain and problems in his right knee that has been going on for years. It has been a lot worse recently. It is more swollen." 

The Veteran did not, however, meet the schedular requirements for TDIU in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) until March 6, 2018. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether the Veteran can meet the requirements for TDIU on an extraschedular basis under § 4.16(b) during the one-year "look back" period. 

However, the Board cannot consider entitlement to TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) in the first instance but must first remand the claim for referral to VA's Director of Compensation Service. Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 10 (2001). Thus, the Board cannot address in the first instance whether the Veteran is entitled to TDIU on an extraschedular basis pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

The initial extraschedular referral decision under § 4.16(b) should address whether there is "sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable by reason of his or her service-connected disabilities." Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019). The evidence in this case for the period prior to March 6, 2018, meets this standard, as the claims file indicates the Veteran was required to stop working well before that date due to his service-connected disabilities.

The Board considers the decision not to refer the issue of entitlement to an extraschedular rating to the Director under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) to have been an error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory duty, with correction of the error having a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 6, 2018, for basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status is remanded 

The Veteran is implied to seek the maximum amount of benefits to which he is entitled. See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993). The Board notes an earlier effective date for establishment of DEA benefits is inextricably intertwined with the claim for an earlier effective date for TDIU. Thus, the remand for referral to the Director of Compensation Service on an extraschedular basis pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) could materially affect the Veteran's eligibility for DEA benefits at an earlier effective date. Therefore, the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for establishment of DEA benefits is inextricably intertwined with the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for TDIU and must also be remanded. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (two issues are "inextricably intertwined" when they are so closely tied together that a final Board decision cannot be rendered unless both issues have been considered).

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. The AOJ MUST refer the matter of entitlement to a TDIU prior to March 6, 2018, to the Director of Compensation Service for an advisory opinion regarding whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment before that time.

2. Thereafter, the AOJ MUST readjudicate the Veteran's appealed issues in view of the totality of the evidence. If the benefits sought are not granted to the fullest extent, the Veteran and his representative must be provided with a copy of the readjudication and afforded an appropriate opportunity to respond.
