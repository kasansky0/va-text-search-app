2. The criteria for service connection for left leg shin splints have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for hemorrhoids have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2007 to November 2007 and from June 2008 to June 2009, including service in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.  Her military occupational specialty (MOS) was Chemical Operations Specialist, and her awards and decorations include the Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2021 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), that denied service connection for shin splints and hemorrhoids.  These matters arose from an April 2021 claim, VA form 21-526EZ.  

In July 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework, electing the hearing docket by the Board.  

The Veteran was afforded a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in February 2025.  

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the notification of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  As the transcript of the February 2025 hearing reflects, at the proceeding the Veteran requested that the 90-day post hearing period be waived.  Thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate this appeal.

Favorable findings identified in the May 2021 rating decision on appeal, which are binding on the Board, include that there is current disability, as left shin splints were noted in an April 2016 VA treatment record, and current disability of hemorrhoids, an April 2021 VA treatment record indicates history of hemorrhoids.  

Preliminary Matters-Representation

With regard to representation, although the Veteran elected to go forward at her February 2025 Board hearing without a representative, a VA form 21-22a was executed in December 2020 between the Veteran and attorney Jan Dills.  Another VA form 21-22a was executed between the Veteran and attorney Jan Dills in July 2022.  This VA attorney-representative sent a letter to VA asking for a status update as to this appeal in September 2022.  In July 2024, prior to the Board hearing, but after the appeal was docketed at the Board and the Veteran was informed of the docketing, the Veteran's attorney sent a letter to the VA stating, "Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am withdrawing as the attorney or record for the above-named claimant."  This letter was signed by attorney Jan Dils.  Thus, the Veteran's representative attempted to withdraw as the Veteran's VA representative in this letter.  The letter does not reflect that a copy was sent to the Veteran.

VA regulation state that after an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals has been filed, a representative may not withdraw services as representative in the appeal unless good cause is shown on motion.  38 C.F.R. § 20.6.  In the July 2024 letter, the Veteran's attorney provided no reason in support of her motion to withdraw from representation, much less a reason that would meet the definition of good cause.  Upon consideration of the attorney's letter, and pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.6, the Board must find that good cause has not been shown as to why representation should be withdrawn.  Therefore, the attorney's attempt to withdraw representation of this Veteran is denied.  

However, at a February 2025 Board hearing in another appeal for the Veteran, on the same day as her Board hearing in this matter, the undersigned discussed the representation matter with the Veteran.  The Veteran stated she wished to proceed unrepresented before VA.  The Veteran stated she wished to proceed unrepresented.  Thus, the attorney is no longer the Veteran's VA representative because the Veteran has chosen to terminate the relationship and proceed pro se.

Service Connection

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability).  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).

Even in the absence of a diagnosed disability, evidence of functional limitations due to symptoms can meet this requirement.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Specifically, in Saunders v. Wilkie, the Federal Circuit found that the term "disability," as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110, refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability, and held that pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability.  To establish the presence of a disability pursuant to Saunders, there must be competent evidence specific to the claimant tending to show that his or her impairment rises to a level to affect earning capacity, which may include showing manifestations of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person.  Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 17 (2020).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107.  

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.  To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board").  

The Board is charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence. Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).  Indeed, in Jefferson v. Principi, 271 F.3d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), citing its decision in Madden, recognized that that Board had inherent fact-finding ability.  Id. at 1076; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) (West 2002). Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to weigh and assess the evidence. Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992).  

As a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is satisfactory, the Board may also properly consider internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the Veteran, and the Veteran's demeanor when testifying at a hearing.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  

Here, all three elements of service connection are established by the competent and credible lay and medical evidence of record as to the bilateral shin splints and hemorrhoids.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Service connection for hemorrhoids is granted.

The Veteran contends that her current hemorrhoids began in service due to the combined effects of eating MREs and vigorous activity and the condition has continued to the present time.  

As noted in the rating decision on appeal, there is current disability of hemorrhoids.  The Board notes a September 2016 VA treatment note provides that the Veteran reported her hemorrhoids started in training eating mostly MREs, which caused her to become constipated and to have painful bowel movements and to develop hemorrhoids to this day.  She also noted itching and irritation.  

While hemorrhoids are not noted in service treatment records (STRS), the Veteran has provided multiple buddy statements from fellow soldiers and her sister attesting to her experiences with hemorrhoids in service.  These people observed that they saw the Veteran uncomfortable and that she confided in them that the condition began in service and continued to the present.  

The Veteran provided detailed testimony as to how her current hemorrhoids began in service and continued to the present time.  She reported she first experienced it in basic training due to the long, vigorous trainings followed by eating MREs.  When they were in the field for extended training, they would have MREs for lunch and dinner.  She had trouble going to the bathroom and eventually had bloody hemorrhoids when she would go to the bathroom.  And then in Texas the problem worsened.  Thereafter, in Iraq, they still had mostly MREs, and the problem continued.  She testified that she did not bring this up due to being embarrassed.  She was a young soldier at that time.  Now that she is older, she understands she should have spoken up to address this medical condition.  

The Veteran testified that she did have hemorrhoid removal which was painful.  She still has painful bloody bowel movements daily from the hemorrhoids.  

Based on the above, the Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the current hemorrhoids are related to service.  

The Veteran is competent to state when she first noted these lay observable symptoms, including pain and bleeding with bowel movements, her credible assertions are not inconsistent with the record and are probative under the facts of this case.  The Board appreciates her candor, and notes that she described having trouble coming forward about these problems in Iraq due to the sensitive nature of the problem and the fact that she was in a war time situation.  Here, the Board also appreciates that the buddy statements, which are consistent with her assertions about the problem existing and how she dealt with it because it was an embarrassing situation.  

There is current diagnosis and there is competent evidence that the problem began in service and have continued since service.  The testimony and lay evidence are competent, credible, and probative, and not inconsistent with her service.  See Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a) (Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces).  Collectively, the evidence shows that the Veteran's current hemorrhoids had their onset in service and have been present since service.  

In light of the foregoing, and after resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for hemorrhoids is warranted. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

2. Service connection for right leg shin splints is granted.

3. Service connection for left leg shin splints is granted.

The Veteran testified that she suffered shin splints during rigorous activity in training and in Iraq consistent with her duties.  She stated in basic training she had to traverse uneven terrain to get acclimated to being a soldier.  She had to perform lots of tactical maneuvers within the woods, with guerilla style training.  She did not want to be recycled so she worked very hard and overdid it.  At Fort Bliss she had to repeatedly mount and dismount tactical vehicles which made it worse as she is short and had to hop.  The problems have been present since that time.  

Buddy statements confirm that people witnessed her having trouble with both her shins, wrapping them, working hard on her runs and trying hard to keep up, and consequently overdoing it.  The statements also noted was her determination as a soldier.  

In April 2021, the Veteran sought VA treatment for flare-ups of shin splints which she had been self-treating.

While the rating decision on appeal notes current disability of left shin splints, the Board as finder of fact finds both left and right leg shin splints.  The Board finds that the February 2025 testimony constituted competent and credible evidence that she has current left and right leg shin splints that began during service and have been recurrent since that time.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The testimony and lay statements are competent evidence tending to show that the impairment that is described as to bilateral shin splints rises to a level to affect earning capacity.  See Saunders and Waite, supra.  Indeed, the Veteran's pain and symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to symptoms VA has enumerated in diagnostic criteria for tibia and fibula impairment.  See, generally, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5262.

The evidence is, at worst, evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's current left and right leg shin splints had their onset during service.  See Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a) (Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces).

In light of the foregoing, and after resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for left and right leg shin splints is warranted. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
