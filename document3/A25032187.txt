ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for pansinusitis sinusitis is denied. 

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for allergic rhinitis status post septoplasty is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms is denied. 

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's pansinusitis sinusitis has not been manifested by near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain and tenderness of affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries; the Veteran has not undergone surgery to address this condition.

2. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's allergic rhinitis, which entailed greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, did not manifest with polyps. 

3. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's hiatal hernia with GERD symptoms has been manifested by recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, and substernal pain, and sleep disturbances but not more severe symptoms that are productive of considerable impairment of health.

4. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran was in receipt of the maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1982 to May 2005.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in April 2024, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the rating decision was promulgated.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran, through his representative has raised an argument for the first time on appeal that the effective date of the claims for service connection should be earlier because he has continuously pursued the claims. See May 2024 Attorney Brief. However, the appeals in this case all stem from a February 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ, where the Veteran sought increased ratings. A claim for an increased rating is a new claim for benefits and is not one of the review options that provides for continuous pursuit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  

1. Entitlement to an increased disability rating in excess of 30 percent for pansinusitis sinusitis is denied. 

The Veteran is currently rated at 30 percent for pansinusitis sinusitis effective February 26, 2024 under Diagnostic Code 6510. He seeks an increased rating. 

Sinusitis conditions are evaluated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Codes 6510 through 6514, which pertain to various types of sinusitis, each of which is rated pursuant to a general rating formula for sinusitis. Under the general rating formula for sinusitis, a noncompensable rating is assigned when the condition is detected by x-ray only. A 10 percent rating is warranted if the condition is manifested by one or two incapacitating episodes per year requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment; or by three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. Id. A 30 percent rating is warranted if the condition is manifested by three or more incapacitating episodes per year requiring prolonged antibiotic treatment; or by more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. A maximum 50 percent rating is warranted if there is chronic osteomyelitis following radical surgery; or near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and tenderness of an affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries. An incapacitating episode means one that requires bed rest and treatment by a physician. Id. 

The Veteran filed an increased rating claim in February 2024. 

The Veteran was afforded an in-person VA compensation examination in March 2024. The Veteran reported no reliance on antibiotic treatment within the last year. He reported episodic symptoms and denied near constant sinusitis. His symptoms included pain of the sinus, tenderness, purulent discharge and crusting with non-incapacitating episodes occurring over seven times a year. The Veteran denied any incapacitating episodes; denied having undergone sinus surgery; denied treatment via any sinus-related procedures; and there was no indication of chronic osteomyelitis.

Based on the above objective medical evidence and subjective lay reports of symptoms by the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence supports the current assignment of a 30 percent disability rating throughout the period on appeal.

A rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted as the evidence of record shows that the Veteran has not completed surgery to address his pansinusitis condition as to warrant a 50 percent rating nor does he endorse near constant symptoms of pansinusitis. As such, the evidence persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 30 percent at any point during the rating period on appeal, and the claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to an increased disability rating in excess of 10 percent for allergic rhinitis is denied. 

The Veteran is currently rated at 10 percent for allergic rhinitis effective February 26, 2024, under diagnostic code 6522. He seeks an increased rating.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522, a 10 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides, or with complete obstruction on one side. A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted where polyps are present.

The Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating in February 2024.

In June 2023, the Veteran was evaluated by his primary care provider. He reported taking Montelukast, Loratadine, And Fluticasone daily for his rhinitis. The Veteran relayed that these medications work well particularly in the spring and fall. 

The Veteran was afforded an in-person VA compensation examination in March 2024. The VA examiner evaluated the Veteran in person and reviewed his medical records and claim file. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran had greater than 50% obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides due to rhinitis. Complete obstruction on either side was not present. The presence of permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates was noted but there were no polyps. There were no other pertinent physical findings including no granulomatous conditions, no scars, and no loss of part of the nose.

A rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted. In this regard, the Board acknowledges that the March 2024 VA examination report noted that the Veteran had permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates as a result of his allergic rhinitis. In addition, other evidence indicates that the Veteran was taking daily medications of Montelukast, Loratadine, and Fluticasone. This was reviewed by the VA examiner as indicated in the evaluation report. As noted above, however, allergic rhinitis is rated under Diagnostic Code 6522, based on the extent to which symptoms result in obstruction of the nasal passages and/or whether polyps are present. In pertinent part, a rating in excess of 10 percent is only warranted when there are polyps. Here, the March 2024 VA examination report explicitly noted that polyps were not present, and nothing in the other evidence available for review demonstrates otherwise.

In light of the foregoing, the Board must find that the weight of the evidence available for review is persuasively against the assignment of a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected allergic rhinitis. A rating in excess of 10 percent is therefore denied.

3. Entitlement to an increased disability rating in excess of 10 percent for hiatal hernia with GERD symptoms is denied. 

The Veteran is currently rated at 10 percent for hiatal hernia with GERD symptoms with an effective date of February 26, 2024. He contends that a higher rating is warranted. 

He is currently evaluated pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7399-7346. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires the use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. When an unlisted disease, injury, or residual condition is encountered, requiring rating by analogy, the diagnostic code number is "built up" with the first two digits being selected from that part of the schedule most closely identifying the part, and the last two digits being "99" for an unlisted condition. Id.

VA revised the schedule of ratings for the digestive system (38 C.F.R. § 4.114), effective May 19, 2024. See 89 Fed. Reg. 19,735 (Mar. 20, 2024). One revision was the creation of a specific DC for GERD, DC 7206. DC 7346 was also amended. The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. See Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal. Applied to this case, that means the "old" digestive criteria can be applied for the entire appeal period, while the "new" digestive criteria can only be applied from May 19, 2024, forward. Because the record before the Board in this matter ended on March 29, 2024, the "new" criteria does not apply here.

Under the "old" Diagnostic Code 7346, the following ratings apply: a 60 percent rating is warranted for hiatal hernia with symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health; a 30 percent rating is warranted for hiatal hernia with persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of a considerable impairment of health; and a 10 percent rating is warranted for hiatal hernia with two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent rating of less severity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.

The Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating in February 2024.

In June 2023, the Veteran was seen by his primary care provider. The Veteran reported that his medications were working for him and that he was not getting food stuck in his throat and that he knew which foods to avoid.

In January 2024, the Veteran was seen by his primary care provider. At this visit, he reported compliance with his daily medication for his GERD. He also reported that in November 2023, he was seen in the emergency department after getting a hotdog stuck in his throat. It had to be manually extracted. He underwent testing that showed inflammation but no dyspnea on exertion or evidence of metaplasia or malignancy. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA compensation examination with respect to his GERD in March 2024. The VA examiner reviewed the Veteran's electronic health record and claim file. He noted that the Veteran was taking omeprazole and famotidine to treat his GERD symptoms. By way of symptoms, he documented that the Veteran was experiencing persistently reoccurring epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, substernal pain, and sleep disturbances. The frequency of these symptoms was more than 4 times per year with episodes lasting 1 to 9 days. The Veteran was negative for esophageal stricture, spasms or diverticulum. He had no tumors or scarring. The VA examiner reported that the Veteran's esophageal conditions did not impact his ability to work.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's GERD during the period here at issue. His disability is not shown to have been productive of considerable impairment of health. Even assuming that the incident where food was lodged in his throat was related to his service-connected hiatal hernia with GERD symptoms, this was an isolated event and in general, he reports that he is managing his symptoms well and knows what food to avoid. His symptoms of epigastric with dysphagia, pyrosis, substernal pain, and reflux do not rise to the level of "persistently recurrent" nor is there evidence that he exhibits symptoms that in combination are productive of considerable impairment. The appeal of this issue must therefore be denied.

4. Entitlement to an increased disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran is currently assigned a 10 percent rating for tinnitus, effective June 1, 2005. On appeal, he seeks a higher rating. 

Diagnostic Code 6260 allows for a single 10 percent rating for recurrent tinnitus, whether the sound in perceived in one ear, both ears, or in the head. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260, Note 2; Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2006). No higher rating is available.

?

Because Diagnostic Code 6260 limits the Veteran to a single 10 percent maximum rating for tinnitus, and he is already in receipt of that rating, there is no legal basis upon which to award a higher rating on a schedular basis. There is no evidence or contention indicating that the Veteran's symptoms of tinnitus are not contemplated by Diagnostic Code 6260. Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other theory of entitlement, nor is any such theory reasonably raised by the record. See May 2024 Appellate Brief; see Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record). The appeal of this issue is denied.
