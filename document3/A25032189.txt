ORDER

Eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees to the appellant from the past due benefits awarded in a January 2024 rating decision granting entitlement to increased ratings for left- and right-hand cold injury residuals as well as a left knee disability and a total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In February 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received a valid VA Form 21-22a appointing the appellant as the Veteran's representative before VA and accompanying fee agreement authorizing the direct payment of 20 percent of past due benefits awarded.

2. In October 2022, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) remanded the issues of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disorder and left- and right-hand cold injury residuals; after further development, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a May 2023 rating decision granting service connection for these three disorders, assigning initial ratings of 10 percent each from May 2016.

3. On behalf of the Veteran, the appellant filed a July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim seeking an increased rating for a lumbar spine disability and a TDIU; an accompanying VA Form 21-8940 TDIU Application claimed that the Veteran's various service-connected disabilities, to include left- and right- hand cold injury residuals and left knee impairment, prevented him from working.

4. The AOJ issued a January 2024 rating decision granting increased 20 percent ratings for the Veteran's left- and right-hand cold injury residuals and left knee disability, all from the date of receipt of the July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ and TDIU applications, as well as a TDIU from June 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees to the appellant from the past due benefits awarded in a January 2024 rating decision granting entitlement to higher ratings for left- and right-hand cold injury residuals, a left knee disability and a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from July 1976 to April 1984, and from July 1986 to January 1993; the appellant was his representative in other matters before VA.  This case comes before the Board on appeal of a January 2024 VA Fee Decision issued by the AOJ with respect to a January 2024 rating decision granting increased ratings and a TDIU.  As this was an initial fee decision, the contested claims procedures of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) apply.

Pursuant to these procedures, a redacted copy of the appellant's substantive appeal was sent to the Veteran's address on file.  Letters were also sent to each contested claimant in April 2024 and June 2024, respectively informing them of their appellate rights and the docketing of the appeal at the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400-20.404.  As the appellant elected the Direct Review docket in her timely January 2024 VA Form 10182 Board Appeal and the Veteran has not requested a different docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 Fee Decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. Eligibility to the direct payment of fees from past due benefits awarded in a January 2024 rating decision

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.  A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization [VSO] as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative," is required to represent a claimant before VA and to authorize VA's disclosure of information to any person or organization representing a claimant before the Department.  Without the signature of a person providing representation for a particular claim under § 14.630 of this part or an accredited VSO representative, agent, or attorney, the appointment is invalid, and the person appointed to provide representation is under no obligation to do so.  

The power of attorney shall meet the following requirements: (1) Contain signature by: (i) The claimant, or (ii) The claimant's guardian, or (iii) In the case of an incompetent, minor, or otherwise incapacitated person without a guardian, the following in the order named - spouse, parent, other relative or friend (if interests are not adverse), or the director of the hospital in which the claimant is maintained; and (iv) An individual providing representation on a particular claim under § 14.630 of this part or an accredited VSO representative, agent, or attorney; and (2) Shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past due benefits.  A direct-pay fee agreement is a fee agreement between the claimant or appellant and an agent or attorney providing for payment of fees out of past due benefits awarded directly to an agent or attorney.  A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to pay the agent or attorney out of past due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA.  A copy of a direct pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).

An initial claim is any complete claim, other than a supplemental claim, for a benefit on a form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  The first initial claim for one or more benefits received by VA is further defined as an original claim.  (See original claim, § 3.160(b)).  Id.  Initial claims include: (i) A new claim requesting service connection for a disability or grant of a new benefit, and (ii) A claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating or rate of a benefit paid based on a change or worsening in condition or circumstance since the last decision issued by VA for the benefit.  Id. 

The AMA applies to all claims originally decided after February 19, 2019.  See Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017).  Under the AMA, a claimant has three administrative review options for an adverse decision which must be filed within one year from notice of a decision - 1) a request for Higher Level Review, 2) an appeal to the Board, or 3) the filing of a supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Timely filing an appropriate administrative review option under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 may preserve an effective date from a claim which is continuously pursued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  The AMA also broadly recognizes three types of claims: a supplemental claim, an initial claim, and a claim for increase.  84 Fed. Reg. 138, 139 (Jan 18, 2019).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

By way of history, the Veteran's initial claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hand cold injury residuals and a left knee disorder were denied by the AOJ in October 2014 and October 2016 rating decisions, respectively.  He ultimately appealed these claims to the Board, which in an October 2022 decision remanded them to the AOJ.  After conducting further development, the AOJ issued a May 2023 rating decision that, in pertinent part, granted entitlement to service connection for the bilateral hand disorders from August 2013 and the left knee disorder from May 2016, assigning initial ratings of 10 percent each for the left hand, right hand, and left knee.  

On behalf of the Veteran, the appellant filed a July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim seeking a higher rating for the Veteran's lumbar spine disability, as well as a VA 21-8940 TDIU Application stating that his various service-connected disabilities, to include the left knee and bilateral hand cold injury residuals, prevented him from finding and maintaining employment.  After further development, the AOJ issued a January 2024 rating decision granting entitlement to higher ratings of 20 percent each for the Veteran's left- and right-hand cold injury residuals as well as his left knee disability, all from the date of VA receipt of the July 2023 EZ and TDIU claims; the decision also granted a TDIU based on his combined disabilities from June 2023.  Internal VA records indicate that this decision resulted in past due benefits of $8,869.84 being awarded to the Veteran.  The January 2024 Fee Decision on appeal denied the direct payment of fees on the basis that the January 2024 rating decision was an initial decision on the claim.  The appellant then filed a timely VA Form 10182 Board Appeal.

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case.  Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. at 28. (2023).  A case, for fees purposes, encompasses all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations.  See, e.g., Perciavalle v. McDonough, 74 F.4th 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2023).  A supplemental claim is any complete claim for a VA benefit on an application form prescribed by the Secretary where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(2).  A supplemental claim need not be filed on a specific VA form.  See Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *16-*20 (March 13, 2025).  

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that a claim for service connection and a subsequent claim for an increased rating are not the same case.  See Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024).  However, an attorney or agent may charge fees for the filing of a supplemental claim requesting review of the initial rating assigned for a disability after the grant of service connection, including whether a TDIU is warranted.  See Chisholm, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *11.  The initial rating assigned is part of the claim for service connection and, therefore, part of the service connection case for fees purposes.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484 (2006).  

The Board initially finds that in February 2022, the appellant submitted a valid VA Form 21-22a appointing her as the Veteran's representative before VA, as well as a duly signed fee agreement stipulating the direct payment of 20 percent of past due benefits awarded.  After review of the evidence of record, the Board further finds that the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of fees from past due benefits awarded in the January 2024 rating decision granting higher bilateral hand and left knee ratings, as well as entitlement to a TDIU.  The Board acknowledges that this rating decision has many of the hallmarks of an initial decision on an original claim: there was no previous rating decision denying a claim of increased rating for the Veteran's bilateral hand or left knee disabilities, the issue of TDIU had not previously been adjudicated, and the effective dates assigned for the higher ratings was consistent with the filing of a "new" increased rating claim in July 2023.  

However, given recent caselaw, the Board concludes that fees are warranted in this instance.  Of note is the Court's finding in Held that an initial decision triggers an attorney's ability to charge fees for representation with respect to the case, as well as the holding in Chisholm that a supplemental claim may be filed on any form prescribed by the Secretary.  Finally, the Court has clarified that when a TDIU request is received, "VA needs to consider the Veteran's disabilities and see whether the record raises the prospect of higher ratings."  Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394, 401 (2024).  Combined, these holdings appear to indicate that the assignment of an initial rating also constitutes an initial decision with respect to the case in the context of a subsequent continuous pursuit of higher initial ratings.  See Chisholm, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336; Jackson, 37 Vet. App. 277.

In this case, the AOJ assigned initial 10 percent ratings for the Veteran's bilateral hand and left knee disabilities in a May 2023 rating decision, and within one year the appellant submitted a July 2023 TDIU claim.  Per Phillips, VA was required to review the Veteran's various service-connected disabilities for increased ratings, and indeed the AOJ granted higher ratings for his bilateral hand and left knee disabilities in the January 2024 rating decision in question.  Given the Court holdings discussed above, the May 2023 rating decision assigning initial ratings can be considered the initial decision with respect to the case, while the July 2023 TDIU claim can be considered a "supplemental claim" filed in continuous pursuit of higher initial ratings.  Therefore, the appellant may charge the Veteran fees for services provided after the initial May 2023 decision, and she is eligible for fees from past due benefits (in the form of higher hand and left knee ratings) awarded in the January 2024 rating decision.  Finally, as these disabilities were included in the July 2023 TDIU claim and the rating decision granted a TDIU based in part upon their occupational impairment, the appellant is also eligible for direct payment of fees from past due benefits awarded in the form of a TDIU.  The appeal is granted.
