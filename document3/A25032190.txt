FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The effective date of April 11, 2024, is the earliest date that the Veteran applied for service connection for foot disabilities that were related to his service-connected right knee disability. 

2. The evidence is against finding that the Veteran has undergone surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis.

3. The evidence is against finding that the Veteran's left foot hammer toes is manifested by hammer toe of all toes. 

4. The evidence is against finding that the Veteran's right foot hammer toes is manifested by hammer toe of all toes. 

5. As the Veteran's service personnel records confirm his military occupational specialty (MOS) as an Aircrew Egress System Mechanic, in-service participation in a Toxic Risk Exposure Activity is conceded.

6. The evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's sleep apnea was incurred in or a result of his active-duty service.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 3, 1984, to September 29, 1987, and from September 30, 1987 to October 31, 1989.    

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of May 2023 and November 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decisions that considered the evidence of record on those dates.   

In December 2023 the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request (Notice of Disagreement) to the Board and selected the Direct Review option by a Veterans Law Judge. As the Veteran selected the direct review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 and November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.    

As the Board is remanding the claims for entitlement to increased ratings for left and right knee disabilities, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  

Finally, the Board recognizes that on the December 2023 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) the Veteran indicated that he disagreed with the effective date and disability evaluation for his claimed sleep apnea, assigned in the rating decision on appeal. However, as the Veteran is not service connected for this disability, there can be no disagreement with a rating or effective date, and therefore these issues are not on appeal before the Board. The Board also recognizes that in the December 2023 NOD, as it relates to his service-connected left and right knee disabilities, the Veteran indicated that his areas of disagreement with the May 2023 rating decision included the effective date and service connection for these disabilities. However, the Veteran was assigned service connection for his bilateral knee disabilities in a January 2011 rating decision. As the May 2023 rating decision did not award service connection, or assign any effective date, the issues of service connection and earlier effective dates are also not before the Board at this time.  

1. An effective date earlier than April 11, 2023, for the award of service connection for bilateral planar fasciitis is denied. 

2. An effective date earlier than April 11, 2023, for the award of service connection for left foot hammer toes is denied.

3. An effective date earlier than April 11, 2023, for the award of service connection for right foot hammer toes is denied. 

The Veteran is seeking to establish an effective date earlier than April 11, 2023, for the award of service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis and left and right foot hammer toes.

Generally, the effective date of an award of a claim is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary of VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a). For claims received on or after March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations governing how to file a claim. The effect of the amendment was to standardize the process of filing claims, as well as the forms accepted, in order to increase the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of claims processing, and to eliminate the concept of informal claims. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155; 79 Fed. Reg. 57660-01.

By way of procedural history, on April 11, 2023, the Veteran submitted a completed claim, in pertinent part, for entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis as secondary to his service- connected right knee disability. In July 2023 the Veteran submitted a letter from a private treatment provider, dated June 2023, in which the examiner opined that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis was related to the service-connected right knee disability. The Veteran was afforded a VA foot conditions examination in November 2023, in which he was diagnosed with bilateral plantar fasciitis and bilateral hammertoes. In the November 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted the claim for service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis, as secondary to the right knee disability and left and right foot hammertoes, as secondary to the bilateral knee disabilities, and assigned an effective date of April 11, 2023, for each disability. 

In this case, the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim for service connection for a foot disability as secondary to the service-connected right knee disability is April 11, 2023, and the Veteran's awards of service connection were properly made effective from that date. There is no evidence in the record of a claim, or any other correspondence received prior to April 11, 2023, which could be construed as a claim for service connection for a foot disability. As such, there is no statutory authority that would allow VA to grant the Veteran an effective date earlier than April 11, 2023. Significantly, neither the Veteran nor his representative has provided any argument for the Board to consider as to why he should be granted an earlier effective date in this matter.

Accordingly, the Board concludes that April 11, 2023, is the proper effective date for the award of service connection for bilateral plantar fascitis and left and right foot hammer toes. As the persuasive evidence of record is against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application, and the claim must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

Increased Schedular Ratings - General

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. § Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § § 4.7. All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § § 4.3.

38 U.S.C. § 1154(a) requires that the VA give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" in evaluating a claim to disability benefits. Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). When analyzing lay evidence, the Board should assess the evidence and determine whether the disability claimed is of the type for which lay evidence is competent. See Davidson, 581 F.3d at 1313; Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).

After the evidence is assembled, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) (2012). When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each issue shall be given to the claimant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3 (2021).

Legal Standards- Musculoskeletal Disabilities

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a [or 4.73] criteria.").

The final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that VA examinations include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint. Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).

The Board also notes recent case law where the Court held that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 does not solely condition the evaluation based on range of motion measurements for a particular diagnostic code, but rather "it conditions that award on evidence of an actually painful, unstable, or maligned joint or periarticular region and the presence of a compensable evaluation in the applicable diagnostic code." Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346, 352 (2016).

Words such as "moderate" and "severe" are not defined in the VA Rating Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. Descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe" and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule. As with any regulatory interpretation where the terms are not defined in the regulation, we presume those terms carry their ordinary dictionary meaning. See Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 336 (2018). The Board finds that these terms are unambiguous and, therefore, a plain dictionary meaning is an appropriate definition. Cf. Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.6 (noting, in general, the Board does not evaluate evidence by applying a mechanical formula, but rather conscientiously to the end that its decisions are equitable and just). According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 999 (11th Ed. 2007), "mild" means gentle in nature or temperate. "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect or average in amount, intensity, quality, or degree. The term "moderately severe" includes impairment that is considered more than "moderate" but not to the extent as to be considered "severe." Webster's New World Dictionary (2nd ed. 1999), 1012. "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree. "Considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267 (11th ed. 2012). Although a medical examiner's use of descriptive terminology such as "mild" is an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, it is not dispositive of an issue. The Board must evaluate all evidence in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Legal Standards: Foot Disabilities 

The Veteran is seeking compensable ratings for left and right foot hammertoes, and a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis, claiming that these disabilities are more severely disabling than the currently assigned ratings. 

The Veteran's left and right hammertoes are evaluated under DC 5282. Under DC 5282, a noncompensable rating is warranted for hammer toes of single toes. A maximum 10 percent rating is warranted for hammer toe of all toes, unilateral, without claw foot. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5282.

The bilateral plantar fascitis is rated under DC 5269. Under DC 5269, a 10 percent rating is warranted for unilateral or bilateral plantar fasciitis. A 20 percent rating is warranted when there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis of one foot (unilateral); a 30 percent rating is warranted when there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis of both feet (bilateral). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5269.

Foot disabilities may also be rated under Diagnostic Codes 5276, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5283, and 5284, when appropriate. Under Diagnostic Codes 5277 and 5279 ratings of up to 10 percent are available for weak foot and metatarsalgia (Morton's disease), respectively. Under Diagnostic Codes 5283, ratings of up to 30 percent are available for malunion or nonunion of the metatarsal bones. Under Diagnostic Codes 5276 and 5278, ratings of up to 50 percent are available for acquired flatfoot and acquired clawfoot. Diagnostic Code 5284 provides for ratings of 10, 20, and 30 percent, respectively, for moderate, moderately severe, and severe foot injury. If there is actual loss of use of the foot, a 40 percent rating is warranted under Diagnostic Code 5284.

Evidence and Analysis 

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was afforded a VA Foot Conditions examination in October 2023. The examiner diagnosed bilateral hammer toes and bilateral plantar fasciitis. During the examination the Veteran reported pain in his heels, which he rated a 9/10. As to functional loss, he stated that he was unable to stand or walk during early morning bathroom runs, or to prepare his children for school in the morning. He described the pain as intense when walking, standing more than 20 minutes, or stretching and massaging his feet. He endorsed several weekly flare ups, bilaterally, which lasted two to three days and were alleviated by rest and medication. The Veteran had undergone non-surgical treatment for his plantar fasciitis, bilaterally, which had not relieved symptoms. The Veteran had not undergone surgical treatment and was not recommended for surgical intervention. As to functional loss attributable to plantar fasciitis, the examiner noted that it was very difficult for the Veteran to walk properly due to excruciating pain over his nerves when he tried to walk. The examiner also recorded that all toes on the Veteran's left and right feet, except his "great toe" were affected by hammer toe. Pain was noted on examination, bilaterally, as well as instability of station and less movement than normal.

4. An evaluation in excess of 10 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis is denied. 

5. A compensable evaluation for left foot hammer toes is denied. 

6. A compensable evaluation for right foot hammer toes is denied. 

Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds that for the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis, rated under DC 5269, a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted. To receive a rating in excess of 10 percent, the evidence must show that there is no relief of the plantar fasciitis from both non-surgical and surgical treatment. Here, as noted during the October 2023 VA examination, nonsurgical treatment did not provide relief of the Veteran's feet symptoms. However, the record does not show that the Veteran has had surgery for his plantar fasciitis or that surgery was advised but that he was not a candidate for such surgery. Therefore, a higher, 30 percent disability rating for the relevant period is not warranted.

For the Veteran's left and right hammer toes, symptomology is best approximated by a noncompensable rating because the evidence of record at this time, as shown during the October 2023 VA examination, indicates that his hammer toe symptoms impact single toes, specifically his second through fifth toes on each foot. Although the Veteran's hammer toe disability impacts almost all of his toes, the next higher 10 percent rating requires that his symptomology impact "all toes unilaterally without claw foot." Such symptomatology has not been shown during the relevant period.  As the Veteran's left and right foot hammer toe symptomology at this time involves only four of five toes, a higher compensable, 10 percent rating for this disability under DC 5282 for either foot is not warranted.

The Board has also considered the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, and 4.59, and the holdings in DeLuca. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202. However, higher ratings are not warranted on the basis of functional loss due to pain or weakness in this case. First, the provisions of DeLuca only apply when a DC is predicated on limitation of motion. See Johnson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 7, 9 (1996). Here, DCs 5282 and 5269 are not based on limitation of motion.

Even assuming DeLuca applies, as noted above, the Veteran has presented with complaints of pain. The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements. These symptoms have been reported and have been included and considered in the VA examination, and the Board finds his complaints of pain credible. Here, although the Veteran may believe that he meets the criteria for a higher rating, the persuasive medical evidence of record show that he does not meet the schedular requirements for such, as explained and discussed above. The Board has concluded that the medical evidence, prepared by skilled professionals, is more probative regarding the Veteran's degree of disability. As such, the Veteran's subjective complaints are fully contemplated by the current ratings that have already been assigned for the left and right foot disabilities. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59.

Further, the Board has reviewed all criteria pertaining to the foot and finds that DCs 5276, 5277, 5278, 5281,5279, and 5283, are not applicable as the medical evidence does not show that the Veteran has pes planus; weak foot; acquired pes cavus/claw foot; metatarsalgia; hallux rigidus; hallux valgus, or malunion or nonunion of the tarsal, or metatarsal bones.

As the Veteran's disabilities are specifically contemplated by DC 5269 and 5282, evaluation under the general category of DC 5284 for other foot injuries is inappropriate. See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333 (2015) (holding that when a condition is specifically listed in the Schedule, it may not be rated by analogy).

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria for the assignment of a disability rating in excess of the currently assigned 10 percent rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis, and non-compensable ratings for left and right hammer toes have not been more nearly approximated for the entire period on appeal. 38U.S.C. §5107(b), 38C.F.R. §4.3. Accordingly, as the persuasive evidence of record is against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application, and the claims must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?49 (1990).

Service Connection 

In order to obtain service connection under 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a) a Veteran must satisfy a three element test: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the so called 'nexus' requirement. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Further, service connection may be warranted for disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a). Secondary service connection requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

7. Service connection for sleep apnea is denied. 

The Veteran is seeking service connection for his obstructive sleep apnea. He puts forth no specific contention in support of his claim.

At the outset the Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any complaints, diagnosis or treatment for any sleep problem during service, including his October 1989 separation examination.

The Board recognizes that the December 2023 rating decision includes a favorable finding that the Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. Thus, the Board is bound by this favorable finding, and the Veteran meets the current disability requirement. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

As it relates to an in-service incident, the Board notes that the record contains an October 2023 VA Memorandum finding that the Veteran participated in a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA), as there was evidence of non-deployment related toxic exposure, which was consistent with the Veteran's service, based on the Veteran's service as an Aircrew Egress System Mechanic.

A TERA is any activity that requires a corresponding entry in an exposure tracking record system; or that the Secretary determines qualifies for purposes of this subsection when considering what is reasonably prudent to protect the health of veterans. See Id. at Sec. 102 (38 U.S.C. § 1710(e)(4)(C)). In light of the fact that the Veteran's DD 214 confirms his military occupational specialty as an Aircrew Egress System Mechanic, the Board agrees with the RO's assessment of the evidence and the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded.

To this, the Board recognizes that on August 10, 2022, the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was enacted. Section 303 of this law provides that if a Veteran submits a claim for service connection with evidence of disability and evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity, then VA must obtain a medical opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that there is a nexus between the disability and the toxic exposure risk activity. Pub. L. 117-168, § 303 (at 38 U.S.C. § 1168).

A VA medical opinion was obtained in November 2023. The examiner noted a review of the claims file, including the TERA memorandum. The examiner noted that the Veteran was exposed to toxic fumes, high pressure air and fluids daily, with methods of exposure being oral, dermatological and inhalation. It was noted that the Veteran did not use personal protective equipment. The examiner ultimately opined that the claimed sleep apnea was less likely than not caused by exposure to the indicated toxic risk activities, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner's rationale was that OSA is the most common sleep related breathing disorder and occurs when throat muscles relax and block the airway. The examiner explained that there is no medical or scientific evidence which supports an indication of a relationship between the development of OSA and the conceded TERA. The examiner did note that the Veteran had risk factors for OSA outside of military service, including being male, having diabetes and having hypertension, and that these risk factors outweighed the factors indicated in the TERA. 

The Board finds the November 2023 VA examiner's opinion to be probative to the issue of the etiology of the Veteran's OSA. Specifically, the examiner reviewed the pertinent evidence of record, including the Veteran's STRs and treatment records and noted such review of relevant records on the examination reports. Moreover, the examiner had the requisite medical expertise and had sufficient facts and data on which to base their conclusions. As such, the Board affords the examination findings great probative weight.

The Board did take the Veteran's statements into consideration. However, the Veteran has not been shown to possess the requisite training or credentials needed to render a competent opinion as to medical diagnosis or causation. King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed.Cir.2012). The Board affords more probative weight to the VA examiner's opinion, as noted above.

The Board also does recognize that on his December 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated that sleep apnea should have been service connected on a secondary basis. Prior to the rating decision on appeal, the Board notes that the Veteran has not provided any supporting evidence for this assertion, including what service-connected condition/s the Veteran believes that the OSA is secondarily related to. Thus, there was no pre-decisional duty to assist error under 38 C.F.R. § 3.159, as the AOJ did not have a duty to provide an obtain a medical opinion on secondary service connection prior to the December 2023 denial.

Upon review of the record, the Board concludes that entitlement to service connection for OSA is not warranted. The Board notes a current diagnosis of OSA, and thus the requirement for a current disability is shown. However, there is no competent evidence to tie the current assertion to any in-service disease or injury, including the Veteran's conceded in-service TERA, or an already service-connected disability. The Board thus finds the Veteran fails the third prong of the test for entitlement to service connection. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38C.F.R. §3.303.

Accordingly, as the persuasive evidence of record is against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application, and the claims must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. An evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right knee degenerative arthritis, limitation of flexion is remanded.

2. A compensable evaluation for right knee degenerative arthritis, limitation of extension is remanded.

3. An evaluation in excess of 10 percent prior to December 14, 2022, and in excess of 40 percent thereafter for left knee degenerative arthritis is remanded.

The Veteran is seeking increased ratings for his bilateral knee disabilities, claiming these conditions is more severely disabling than the currently assigned ratings.  

For the reasons explained below, the Board finds that this matter should be remanded to afford the Veteran a new VA knee examination.  

The record reflects that correspondence was sent to the Veteran on May 12, 2022, informing him that a VA contractor had been asked to conduct his required medical examination, and that the Veteran would be informed of the date, time and place of examination. The file contains a VA Exam Scheduling Request, dated May 12, 2022, requesting that the bilateral knee examination be scheduled. The record however does not contain documentation of communication to the Veteran informing him of the date of the VA examination. An Exam Scheduling Request Contention Cancellation, dated June 6, 2022, indicates that the knee examination was canceled because they were unable to contact the Veteran.    

In consideration of the fact that there is no indication in the claims file that the Veteran was informed of the date and time of the scheduled VA examination, the Board finds that good cause has been shown and that the rescheduling of the VA examination is appropriate to decide the Veteran's claim. See Clark v. Principi, 15?Vet. App.?61, 63 (2001); Fluker v. Brown, 5. Vet. App. 296, 298 (1993); Piano v. Brown, 5?Vet. App.?25, 26-27 (1993). 

One of the effects of the AMA is to narrow the set of circumstances in which the Board must remand appeals to the AOJ for further development instead of immediately remanding them directly. Nevertheless, even under the AMA the Board still has the duty to remand issues when necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. See Pub L. No. 115-55 section (2)(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). In this case, prior to the rating decision on appeal, good cause was shown for the Veteran failing to appear for scheduled knee examination. This deficiency constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). Therefore, a remand is necessary to schedule new VA mental health examination.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a new VA examination with an appropriate VA medical professional to determine the current nature and severity of his service-connected left and right knee disabilities. The electronic record, to include a copy of this remand, must be reviewed in conjunction with the examination. All testing deemed necessary must be conducted and results reported in detail. Ensure that the examiner provides all information required for rating purposes. The examiner should: Conduct all indicated tests and studies, to include range of motion studies expressed in degrees and in relation to normal range of motion, and should describe any pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, and incoordination present. To the extent possible, express any functional loss in terms of additional degrees of limited motion of the Veteran's left and right knees, i.e., the extent of the Veteran's pain-free motion.

Pursuant to Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), please record the results of range of motion testing for pain on both active and passive motion and in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing. If a joint cannot be tested on "weight-bearing," please specifically indicate why that testing cannot be done.

Pursuant to Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the examiner is instructed to inquire whether there are periods of flare-ups. If the answer is "yes," the examiner should state their severity, frequency, and duration explaining if there are any additional or increased symptoms and limitations experienced during flares. The examiner(s) must ALSO name the precipitating and alleviating factors. The examiner(s) must ALSO estimate, "per [the] veteran," to what extent, if any, they affect functional impairment. The examiner must in particular render an opinion as to the current severity of any radiculopathy. The examiner should note the symptomatology attributable to any radiculopathy and comment as to whether the symptoms are best described as mild, moderate, or severe incomplete nerve paralysis or complete paralysis. The examiner should also comment on the Veteran's ability to function in an occupational or worklike setting, and describe any functional impairment caused solely by his service-connected bilateral knee disabilities (specifically considering the Veteran's neurological and orthopedic manifestations).
