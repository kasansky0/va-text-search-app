REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from October 1995 to October 1999.  

The appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2020 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  See September 2020 Rating Decision (in pertinent part, denying service connection for left foot achilles tendonitis and left foot callouses).  

The Veteran submitted a request for higher level review, and in March 2021, a higher-level reviewer at the RO confirmed and continued the denials of service connection for left foot achilles tendonitis and left foot callouses based on the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2020 decision.  See November 2020 Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review (VA Form 20-0996); March 2021 Decision Review Officer (DRO) Decision.  

Later that month, the Veteran appealed the decision to the Board by requesting the Hearing docket, which provides an opportunity to have a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge of the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  See March 2021 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182).  The Veteran testified at a Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in July 2024.

However, in March 2025, the Veteran, by and through his authorized representative, requested a withdrawal of the pending Board appeal.  See Statement in Support of Claim (VA Form 21-4138) dated March 7, 2025, (containing the Veteran's full name, the VA file number, and a statement reflecting that the Veteran wished to "withdraw his claims for Left Food Achilles tendonitis and left foot callouses").  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  In the present case, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
