ORDER

The Veteran's requests for Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the May 19, 2020, Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) decision were timely filed; to that extent only, the appeal is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On April 14, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review.  He indicated that he wanted the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) to conduct a Higher-Level Review of the May 19, 2020, decision that denied his request for additional education under the VR&E program.  

2. The Veteran's VA Form 20-0996 was sent via email and received by the AOJ on June 11, 2021.  A physical copy was hand delivered to and received by the AOJ on September 20, 2021.  These requests were received over a year after the issuance of the May 19, 2020, AOJ decision.

3. Good cause has been shown to warrant extending the time limit for filing the HLR request.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the timely submission of the June 11, 2021, and September 20, 2021, HLR requests have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104B, 5104C; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109, 3.2500(a), 3.2601.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1985 to August 1988 and from August 1990 to January 1992.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 28, 2022, decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Senior Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (SVRC).  In that decision, the SVRC that both versions of the Veteran's VA Form 20-0996, which were received by the AOJ on June 11, 2021, and September 20, 2021, respectively, were untimely as they were received outside of the time limit for filing an HLR request with the May 19, 2020, decision that denied the Veteran's claim for additional education under the VR&E program.  

In January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket under the modernized appeal review system ("AMA").  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 28, 2022, AOJ HLR decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Although this decision is favorable to the Veteran, if he would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Whether the June 2021 and September 2021 HLR requests were timely.

A veteran must file a request for HLR within one year of the notice of the AOJ decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a).  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b), time limits within which claimants or beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown.

In the present case, the relevant AOJ was issued on May 19, 2020.  On June 11, 2021, and on September 20, 2021, VA received a completed HLR requesting review of the May 19, 2020, AOJ decision.

In its March 28, 2022, decision, the AOJ informed the Veteran that the HLR request was not timely filed.  The Veteran appealed that decision.

There is no question that the June 2021 and September HLR requests were not timely filed, as they was not received until more than one-year following the issuance of the May 2020 AOJ decision that denied the Veteran's underlying claim for VR&E benefits.  As such, the only question remaining before the Board is whether there is good cause to extend the filing deadline pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).

On March 13, 2020, the President declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency, effective March 1, 2020.  In April 2020, VA issued VBA Policy Letter 20-02 (Policy Letter), providing guidance on the financial relief actions and time limit extensions it would be providing Veterans given this national emergency.  The Policy Letter provides that, although claimants could still continue to file claims for compensation by mail, fax, or online, for those unable to file a claim due to the COVID-19 pandemic, VA may grant time limit extension requests and postpone final actions on a claim "provided good cause is shown for the delay.  VA has determined that delays due to COVID-19 constitute good cause."  See VBA Policy Letter 20-02 (Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Financial Relief Actions and Time Limit Extensions), found at: https://benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/factsheets/financial-literacy/COVID-19-financial-relief-time-extensions.pdf.  The Policy Letter clarifies that claimants should specify the time limit for which they are seeking an extension.

The Board notes that the Veteran submitted additional argument and evidence when he filed his January 2023 VA Form 10182.  And while the Board is unable to consider the additional evidence due to the AMA evidence window restrictions of the Direct Review docket, the Board observes that the Veteran specifically asserted that his June 2021 and September 2021 HLR requests should have been accepted as "timely" because they were submitted during the COVID-19 pandemic which was recognized as a national emergency. 

Given the COVID-19 deadline easing policies that were in effect during the period on appeal, the Board finds good cause to extend the time for filing and accepts as timely filed the June 2021 and September 2021 HLR requests as to the May 2020 AOJ decision that denied the Veteran's claim for additional VR&E training.  Thus, the appeal is granted to this limited extent.  To be clear, the Board is not granting the underlying claim for additional VR&E training.  Rather, the AOJ will issue a new HLR decision regarding the Veteran's request for additional education.  If the AOJ issues a decision that is averse to the Veteran's interests and he wishes to appeal that decision to the Board, he will need to submit a new VA Form 10182.
