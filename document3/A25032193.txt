ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, as secondary to a low back disability, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's low back disability is at least as likely as not related to his military service.

2. The Veteran's radiculopathy of the left lower extremity is secondary to his low back disability. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a low back disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, as secondary to a low back disability, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1986 to February 1990, and from February 1991 to March 1991. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge on December 5, 2024.  A transcript of the hearing is of record.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection generally will be awarded when a veteran has a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a link ("nexus") between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

For the chronic diseases listed in 38 U.S.C. § 1101 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), which include arthritis, service connection may alternatively be established with evidence of chronicity of the disease during service or during a presumptive period following service separation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012 (holding that only the chronic diseases listed in § 1101 of the statute and § 3.309(a) of the regulations are subject to the provisions of § 3.303(b)).  For conditions noted during service (or in the presumptive period) but not shown to be chronic at the time, a continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  

To establish service connection for a chronic disease based on a continuity of symptoms, the following elements must be satisfied: (1) a condition "noted" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptoms; and (3) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptoms.  Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 263-264 (2015).

When chronicity or continuity of symptomatology of a chronic disease is established as set forth above, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, no matter how remote in time from the period of service, will be service connected unless clearly attributable to causes unrelated to service ("intercurrent" causes).  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

In addition, where a veteran served continuously for 90 days or more during a period of war, or after December 31, 1946, there is a presumption of service connection for arthritis if it manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service, even if there is no evidence of the disease during the service period itself.  38 U.S.C. § § 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).  This presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d). 

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; but see Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (holding all that is needed is a "but for" causation or aggravation to show entitlement to secondary service connection).  

There is no "temporal" requirement to receive an award of secondary service-connection and, therefore, a claimant is not precluded from service-connection under 3.310 merely because the primary service-connected disability was diagnosed after the disability claimed as secondary. "...the primary disability need not be service-connected or even diagnosed at the time the secondary condition is incurred."  Frost v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 131, 134.

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance-which includes but is not limited to equipoise-the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply.  Id. at 781-82.

1. Service connection for a low back disability.

2. Service connection for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a low back disability, diagnosed during the appeal as intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS), as well as left lower extremity radiculopathy on a secondary basis.  

The Veteran has asserted in several lay statements that, during deployment to Panama in 1986, he injured himself in a fall and complained of back pain to his fellow soldiers throughout the rest of the deployment (see July 2018 Buddy/Lay Statement, October 2019 Statement in Support of Claim).  He has also reported that he felt a sharp pain in his back in 1987 while lifting trash (see October 2019 Statement in Support of Claim, February 2021 VA examination), and that his back pain started in 1989 due to the gear and equipment he was required to carry in the performance of his duties, which got progressive worse until his first back surgery in 1996 (see April 2009 Correspondence, September 2018 VA examination).

His service treatment records (STRs) do note a January 1987 complaints of back pain for two months.  His remaining STRs are negative for complaints or treatment relating to back pain. 

The claim has been denied based on the negative opinions of VA examiners in September 2018 and February 2021 who opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's current low back disability is related to his in-service back pain.  The examiners noted, essentially, that the Veteran's in-service report of back pain was acute, with his separation examination being silent for low back pain.  The February 2021 examiner also stated that lumbar strains, which the Veteran was diagnosed with in service, are a muscular condition which "in and of itself does not clinically progress into disc herniation or any of the symptoms that the veteran experienced later in his life."  The examiner also noted inconsistencies in the Veteran's reports regarding the onset of his back pain in service. 

Within the 90-day evidentiary window following the Veteran's Board hearing, however, he submitted a medical opinion from Dr. N.G., who reviewed the claims file and provided a positive etiological opinion regarding the Veteran's back disability.  Notably, Dr. N.G., who stated that he has treated the Veteran since 2021, explained that: 

During a fall, it is quite common to sustain injuries to the spine.  The sudden change in position combined with rapid contact with the ground can lead to heavy trauma, causing nerve damage and subsequent limitation of limb use. Additionally, the above can also lead to inflammation in the joints and nerves of the spine. When facet joints are affected, the overall damage is often worse as the resultant scarring of the joints can produce protracted pain.  Overtime, accelerated degeneration of facet joints secondary to injury leads to the development of chronic spondylosis with associated ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, increased osteophyte formation and eventually more severe foraminal and central canal stenosis the lumbar spines.  Indeed, this is the course that [the Veteran's] lumbar spine underwent from 1987-1996, leading to the necessary lumbar spine surgery [in 1996]. 

Additionally, the Board notes that a layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his or his current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  While the Board acknowledges what might seem like inconsistencies in the Veteran's reported history regarding when he first noticed back pain in service, it does not find that his reports of first injuring his back in Panama in 1986 to be all that inconsistent considering that he would then report back pain for two months the following January 1987 as documented in his STRs.  His statement regarding his back pain beginning in 1989 due to the gear and equipment he was required to carry is also not inconsistent with his assertions that the rigors of his duties aggravated his back pain.  

There is also no evidence of record suggesting an intercurrent injury between the Veteran's 1991 separation from service and the first post-service reports of back pain in the record.  The Board notes, importantly, that the Veteran's first post-service indication of a low back disability is only a few years following service, with private treatment records showing back treatment as early as 1993.  See April 16, 2009 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.  

Based on the above, the Board finds that the Veteran's competent and credible testimony and statements of the continuity of symptomology of his disability, as well as the opinion of Dr. N.G., are at least in equipoise with the negative opinions of the VA examiners.  Thus, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether his current low back disability is related to his back pain in service.  

The claim for service connection for a low back disability is therefore granted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.120, 3.303, Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

Additionally, the Veteran seeks service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy.  His VA back examination confirms that he has a diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve in the left lower extremity.  As such, service connection is also warranted for this disability as caused by his low back disability on a secondary basis.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The Board thanks the Veteran for his service.
