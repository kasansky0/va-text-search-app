FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a skin disorder manifested as scarring or papules of the face and neck, other than his service-connected PFB, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a TBI, other than service-connected stroke, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. Obesity is not a disability for VA compensation purposes.

4. The Veteran's OSA is secondary to his obesity, serving as an intermediary step between his service-connected physical disabilities and his OSA.

5. The Veteran's left ankle disability is manifested by pain, weakness, and instability more approximate to marked limitation of motion.

6. Since September 13, 2018, the Veteran's migraine headaches resulted in very frequent prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

7. From September 13, 2018, to May 13, 2020, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded gainful employment.

8. The severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms did not more closely approximate total occupational and social impairment.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from August 1986 to August 1989.  

In the April 2021 VA Form 10182s, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  

The Veteran testified at a Board hearing that was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in October 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of notice of the November 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision that granted a TDIU, SMC, DEA benefits, an increased rating for migraine headaches, and denied an increased rating for a depressive disorder and left ankle sprain.  Although the Veteran had filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review (HLR) for the above claims, the November 2020 rating decision considered evidence up to that date and was not a HLR rating decision.  Therefore, the Board will consider this rating decision as the correct decision on appeal.  

Additionally, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of notice of the September 2019, November 2019, and May 2020 AOJ decisions denying service connection for scarring of the face and neck, obesity, a TBI, and OSA, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review.  

The Board will also consider any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Service connection for scarring of the face and neck, other than service-connected PFB, is denied.

2. Service connection a papules of the face and neck, other than service-connected PFB, is denied.

3. Service connection for a TBI, other than service-connected stroke, is denied.

The Veteran has requested service connection for scarring and papules of the face and neck and a TBI.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

However, a review of the record does not reflect a disability manifested by scarring or papules of the face and neck other than the already service-connected PFB.  The same is the case with the claim for service connection for a TBI.  There is no evidence of a TBI or TBI residuals outside of the already service-connected stroke.  The rating code under which the Veteran's PFB and stroke residuals are rated consider his symptoms shown.

The Veteran has not put forth other contentions related to these claims, to include whether he suffers from symptoms other than related to his PFB or stroke.  

To the extent that the Veteran contends that he suffers from scarring of the face and neck and a TBI other than his service-connected PFB and residuals of a stroke,  such a determination is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that the Veteran has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). 

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claims.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for scarring or papules of the head and neck and residuals of a TBI is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

4. Service connection for obesity is denied.

The VA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) issued a precedential opinion addressing questions regarding whether obesity may be considered a disease for the purposes of service connection under 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1131, and whether obesity may be considered a disability for purposes of secondary service connection.  In general, VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 concludes that obesity per se is not a disease or injury for purposes of 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1131 and, therefore, may not be service-connected on a direct or secondary basis.  The opinion notes that particularities of body type, such as being overweight or underweight, do not, of themselves, constitute disease or disability subject to service connection.  Id. The opinion further held that, because it occurs over an extended period of time, the onset of obesity cannot qualify as an in-service event for the purposes of establishing service connection.

The Board notes that obesity may act as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a).  To meet this criterion, the Veteran must demonstrate that a previously service-connected disability caused the Veteran to become obese, that obesity was a substantial factor in causing secondary disability, and that the secondary disability would only have occurred but for the obesity.  VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 (January 6, 2017).

Thus, while the evidence shows that the Veteran is obese, obesity is not considered a disease or injury for which direct or secondary service connection may be granted.  See generally 38 C.F.R. Part 4 (VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities) (does not contemplate a separate disability rating for obesity).  Accordingly, as obesity or being overweight is not a disability for VA compensation purposes, the claim for service connection for obesity must be denied.  However, the next section discusses the Veteran's obesity as an intermediary step.

5. Service connection for OSA is granted.

The Veteran contends that his OSA is secondary to his service-connected disabilities. 

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of OSA.  In May 2020, a VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion on the matter.  However, aside from stating that obesity and OSA were two separate entities, the examiner did not provide a rationale.  Rather, the examiner went on to state that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities did not preclude all sorts of exercise, and that obesity is a choice, in that it is caused by excessive food intake and lack of physical exercise.  The examiner then stated that obesity can increase the risk of OSA, but causality wasn't shown.  In another VA opinion also dated in May 2020, a VA examiner stated that the Veteran's obesity was the best documented risk factor for his development of OSA.

From these opinions, and from the record, the Board concludes that the approximate balance of the evidence weighs in the Veteran's favor.  For one, the Veteran is in receipt of a service connection for a depressive disorder which has been linked to his stroke.  The evidence shows, then, that even if his obesity is due to lack of physical exercise and excessive food intake, there are both psychological and physical reasons why the Veteran has engaged in these activities causing his obesity.      

Given such, the Board finds that the elements of secondary service connection have been shown.  Specifically, the record supports a finding that the Veteran's obesity is due to his service-connected disabilities, and that his obesity is the cause of his OSA.  

Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for OSA is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

6. An increased 20 percent rating for a left ankle disability is granted.

The Veteran's left ankle disability has been rated under Diagnostic Code 5271. Effective February 7, 2021, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271, was revised.  However, because this is after the review period, the Board will consider the older version of the regulation.

Diagnostic Code 5271 provides a 10 percent rating for moderate ankle limitation of motion and a 20 percent rating for marked ankle limitation of motion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.  Normal ranges of motion of the ankle are dorsiflexion from 0 to 20 degrees, and plantar flexion from 0 to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

The words "moderate" and "marked" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes were not defined in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence, to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  The use of terminology such as "marked" by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue.  All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 3 8 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

On November 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported pain in the left ankle that would last for hours every day, as well as swelling that made it so that he could not stand for long.  His pain would increase with walking long distances, and he would use a cane for stability.  He used an ankle brace and special shoes for support.  Dorsiflexion was limited to 9 degrees and plantar flexion was limited to 34 degrees.  On repetitive testing, planter flexion was limited to 8 degrees and dorsiflexion was limited to 30 degrees.  There was evidence of pain, fatigue, weakness, lack of endurance, and incoordination affecting functional loss.  The functional impact was that the Veteran was unable to walk or stand for long periods of time due to ankle pain, fatigue, and weakness. 

At his hearing, the Veteran reported similar symptoms, stating that his ankle felt unstable.  

Given the above, the Board finds that the Veteran's left ankle disability is more akin to a marked ankle disability, especially when considered the limitation of motion, extent of functional loss, and feeling of instability.  Therefore, the Board finds that a 20 percent rating for a left ankle disability is warranted.

7. From September 13, 2018, to May 13, 2020, an increased 50 percent rating for migraine headaches is granted.

8. Since May 13, 2020, a rating in excess of 50 percent for migraine headaches is denied.

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his headaches for the period from September 13, 2018, to May 13, 2020.  The Board finds that a higher 50 percent rating is warranted for this period as this is when his claim was originally filed, and the appeal has been continuously prosecuted since this date.  In addition, the evidence supports a finding that his symptoms met the criteria for a 50 percent rating throughout the appeal period.

Migraine headaches are rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100, for migraine.  Under DC 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  A 50 percent rating is the highest schedular rating under DC 8100.

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?245, 252 (2018).  This renders 38?C.F.R. §§?4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation.  The Court, however, has held that under Diagnostic Code 8100, which specifically governs migraine headaches, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" plainly describes migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality.  See Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252.

Moreover, pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The rating criteria for a 50 percent rating contain several undefined phrases.  The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253.  The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraines attack must render the veteran entirely powerless.  Id.  The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract."  Id. (internal citation omitted).  

Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability."  Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  Pierce v. Principi, 18?Vet. App.?440, 445-46 (2004).

Here, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for headaches on September 13, 2018.  The claim was granted and a noncompensable rating was awarded in November 2018, with an effective date of September 13, 2018.  The Veteran appealed this decision to the Board, and in March 2020, the Board denied the claim for increased rating.  

The Veteran then filed a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for an increased rating for headaches in December 2018, shortly after the Board denial.  In April 2020, the AOJ denied the increased rating claim.  The Veteran filed a request for higher level review of this decision in July 2020.  In November 2020, an increased 50 percent rating for headaches was granted with the effective date of May 13, 2020.  However, as is demonstrated, the Veteran continuously prosecuted this claim since September 13, 2018.  While he did not file his December 2018 supplemental claim on the correct form, this is not a necessary step to continue the prosecution of an appeal.  The supplemental claim must only be filed on a form prescribed by the Secretary.  Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, (U.S. Vet. App. March 13, 2025).

When looking at the period from September 13, 2018, to May 13, 2020, a November 2020 VA examination reflects migraine headaches that were increasing in frequency from two per month to four per month.  The Veteran also had increased fatigue and weakness with nausea and photophobia.  The headaches were found to be very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  

A review of the VA treatment records shows that in January 2019, the Veteran sought treatment for headaches, reporting that his headaches became debilitating in late 2018.  Given such, the Board finds that the 50 percent rating should begin September 13, 2018. 

During the October 2024 hearing, the Veteran indicated that an increased 50 percent rating for migraine headaches dating back to September 13, 2018, would satisfy his appeal.  See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993).  \

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that this increased rating back to September 13, 2018, is a complete grant of the benefit sought on appeal and additional discussion of whether a higher schedular rating or extraschedular consideration for this disability is not warranted.

9. From September 13, 2018, to May 13, 2020, a TDIU is granted.

For similar reasons, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted from September 13, 2018, to May 13, 2020.  

A total disability rating may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as the result of service-connected disabilities.  See 38 U.S.C. 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

Consideration may be given to a veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; see also Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85-86 (2014).

To qualify for a total rating for compensation purposes, the evidence must show: (1) a single disability rated as 100 percent disabling; or (2) that the veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities and there is one disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or if more than one disability, at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and a combined disability rating of 70 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).  For the purpose of establishing one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, disabilities affecting a single body system are considered as one disability.  Id.  Disabilities that are not service connected cannot serve as a basis for a total disability rating.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.19.

Unlike the regular disability rating schedule, which is based on the average work impairment caused by a disability, "entitlement to TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstance."  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447. 452 (2009) (quoting Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 116 (2008)); see also Todd, 27 Vet. App. at 85-86.  Therefore, in adjudicating a TDIU claim, VA must take into account the individual veteran's education, training, and work history.  Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164, 168 (1991) (level of education is a factor in deciding employability); see Friscia v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 294 (1994) (considering veteran's experience as a pilot, his training in business administration and computer programming, and his history of obtaining and losing 19 jobs in the previous 18 years); Beaty v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 532 (1994) (considering veteran's 8th grade education and sole occupation as a farmer); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991) (considering veteran's master's degree in education and his part-time work as a tutor).

In determining whether a veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, attention must be given to the veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy) required by the occupation at issue.  Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, and reaching, as well as auditory and visual limitations; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue. Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity.  Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58. 73 (2019).

The ultimate question of whether a Veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is an adjudicatory determination, not a medical one.  See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

First, the Board finds that the Veteran now meets the schedular criteria for consideration of a TDIU from when he filed his claim for increased rating for migraine headaches, September 13, 2018.  Although the Veteran filed his claim for a TDIU on May 20, 2020, a claim for TDIU was also raised by the record as part and parcel with his claim for increased rating for migraine headaches.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453 (2009).

From September 13, 2018, to May 20, 2020, the Veteran was in receipt of a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches, a 10 percent rating for tinnitus, a 10 percent rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae, a 10 percent rating for hypertension, and a 10 percent rating for a left ankle sprain.  Then, in January 2018, he was awarded a 10 percent rating for residuals of a stroke.  These ratings meet the schedular criteria for consideration of a TDIU.

In that regard, on November 2020 VA examination for headaches, the examiner concluded that the Veteran was unable to work due to his migraine headaches, as he would have to retreat to a dark room and sleep.  His migraines had become so severe that he had to go to the emergency room for treatment.  It also took him days to recover due to his migraines. 

Based upon this opinion, the Board finds that the Veteran has met the criteria for a TDIU.  In that regard, the record further established that he has not been gainfully employed since 2013.  The record shows that the Veteran had completed course work related to HVAC systems and had been applying for HVAC jobs in 2017, but that he was not employed during this period.  A December 2014 Vocational Rehabilitation letter stated that he suffered from employment impairment due to his service-connected disabilities. 

Based upon the competent and probative evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran was precluded from substantially gainful employment for this period, mostly due to his migraine headaches.  Therefore, a TDIU is warranted from September 13, 2018, to May 20, 2020.

10. A rating in excess of 70 percent for a depressive disorder is denied.

The Veteran contended at his hearing that this appeal is related to his TDIU appeal, in that because his TDIU appeal was granted based on his depressive disorder, the effective date for a TDIU should date back to the filing of the claim for increased rating for a depressive disorder.  However, as described above, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted even prior to September 1, 2019, and is now effective September 13, 2018.  Therefore, because the Veteran indicated at his hearing that this earlier effective date for TDIU satisfies both that appeal and this one, any further analysis for increased rating is not warranted.  See AB v. Brown, supra. In so finding, and as an aside, the Board notes that any higher rating for a depressive disorder would not amount to any further disability compensation for the Veteran.

11. From September 13, 2018, to September 1, 2019, SMC at the housebound rate is denied.

12. From September 1, 2019, to May 13, 2020, SMC at the housebound rate is granted.

The Board finds that SMC at the housebound rate is not warranted from September 13, 2018, to September 1, 2019, but is in fact warranted beginning September 1, 2019.

Special monthly compensation is payable where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i).

The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that VA has a "well-established" duty to maximize a claimant's benefits.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2010); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).  This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a claimant's disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  Id. (finding that SMC " benefits are to be accorded when a Veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim").

In this case, from September 13, 2018, to September 1, 2019, the Veteran is in receipt of a TDIU, which is a 100 percent rating.  However, this is based upon his 50 percent rating for migraine headaches.  For this period, the Veteran does not have other disabilities that would independently be ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the TDIU.  The evidence also does not suggest that the Veteran was housebound or bedridden due to his service-connected disabilities during this period.  The Board also notes that the above grant of service connection for OSA does not affect this finding, as the effective date of any OSA rating is after this time.

But, from September 1, 2019, to May 13, 2020, SMC at the housebound rate is warranted.  This is the date upon which the Veteran was granted service connection for his psychiatric disorder.  And, as has already been established by the VA, both in the November 2020 rating decision that granted a TDIU and at the October 2024 hearing, this grant can be assigned solely to the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder.  Because you could grant this TDIU claim purely as a result of his acquired psychiatric disorder beginning September 1, 2019, it follows that the grant of SMC at the housebound rate would also date back to this date, too, because he would then be in receipt of a 100 percent rating, and separate, independently ratable disabilities equaling 60 percent.  The Board notes that since May 13, 2020, the Veteran is already in receipt of this benefit. 

13. From September 13, 2018, to May 13, 2020, basic eligibility for DEA benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 are granted.

Because the Board has granted TDIU as of September 13, 2018, the Board also finds that entitled to DEA benefits should also date back to September 13, 2018, as such marks the beginning of having permanent and total disability.  38 U.S.C. Chapter 35; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3020, 21.3021.
