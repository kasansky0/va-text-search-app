Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), secondary to right knee strain with associated weight gain, on a causation basis, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea had onset in service.

2. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) was caused by service connected right knee strain with associated weight gain.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for DM2, secondary to right knee stain with associated weight gain, on a causation basis, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310; Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F. 4th 1360, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2023); Payne v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 373, 384 (2019); VAOPGCPREC 1-2017.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from August 2003 to July 2004.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from appeals of August and November 2023 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In the August 2023 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for DM2.  In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ confirmed and continued denial of service connection for sleep apnea.  However, the AOJ readjudicated the matter on the basis of receipt of new and relevant evidence.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding as to new and relevant evidence (see 38 C.F.R. §3.104(c)) and therefore proceeds to decide the Veteran's sleep apnea claim on the merits. 

In his August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decisions on appeal.  

If evidence was added during the ineligible period, it has not been considered.  If this is the case, and the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any of this evidence, he can at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving a decision and the additional evidence would be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim would preserve the date of the claim as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

As a final introductory note, the Court has held that, because 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) "gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up."  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024).  As the Board is granting the benefit sought in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in adjudicating these matters prior to expiration of the relevant period.

Service connection: Applicable Law

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F. 3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection is also warranted for disability that is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Secondary service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) is warranted where a non-service-connected disability would have been less severe but for a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.  Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F. 4th 1360, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2023) ("but for" causation "applies to the natural progression of a condition not caused by a service-connected injury or disease, but that nonetheless would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability. Stated another way... compensation [is warranted] for a worsening of functionality-whether through an inability to treat or a more direct, etiological cause").  The Court has also held that the "'causation requirement in the phrase 'the result of' is 'broad,' in that it permits entitlement to VA benefits 'based on a multi-link causal chain.'"  Payne v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 373, 384 (2019).  See also Spicer, 61 F. 4th at 1364 ("The but-for causation standard is not limited to a single cause and effect, but rather contemplates multi-causal links, including action and inaction"). 

The Board points out that although obesity is not a disability for VA compensation purposes, obesity may act as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service-connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  VAOPGCPREC 1-2017; see also Marcelino v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 155 (2018) (affirming the Board's decision that service connection is not warranted for obesity as it is not in and of itself a disability for VA purposes, but not addressing VAOPGCPREC 1-2017).   In order to establish service connection on this basis, three criteria must be met: (1) the service-connected disability must have caused the veteran to become obese; (2) the obesity as a result of the service-connected disability must be a substantial factor in causing the disability for which service connection is sought; and (3) the disability for which service connection is sought would not have occurred but for obesity caused by the service-connected disability.  Id. 

Sleep Apnea

The Veteran has raised entitlement based upon secondary causation and due to toxic exposure in service.  Considering the instant favorable decision to grant service connection on a direct basis for this service claim for sleep apnea, as explained below, a discussion of any other theory of entitlement is not necessary, as such would not result in an earlier effective date.  Johnson v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-7589, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 383 (Mar. 26, 2025) (the Board cannot dismiss an appeal from the denial of service connection for a disability for which service connection has already been granted without considering the effective date consequences of the grant of service connection on another basis); Cf. Stender v. Wilkie, No. 19-0068, 2020 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 520, *5-*7 (Mar. 27, 2020) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) (the Board erred in granting service connection based on the Camp Lejeune Contaminated Water (CLCW) presumption without considering other theories of entitlement that could warrant an earlier effective date because of the effective date of the CLCW presumption); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

For the following reasons, entitlement to sleep apnea is warranted on a direct basis.

Upon a November 2022, June 2023, and November 2023 VA examination reports/opinions, clinicians reported a current diagnosis of sleep apnea.  Moreover, in May 2023 private opinion, a clinician indicated a current diagnosis of sleep apnea.  Therefore, the current disability requirement for sleep apnea has been met. 

The Veteran is competent to report discernable and on-going symptoms, to include when his sleep problems began during service in 2003, pauses in nighttime breathing, frequent awakenings, and daytime fatigue which functionally impacts concentration and the abilities to complete tasks.  Stated directly, the discernable sleep-related symptoms were observed in service and has been on-going ever since (to now require the use of a continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) device).  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (a veteran is competent to testify regarding observations); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1337 (holding lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence).  The Board finds that the Veteran's lay accounts are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of service, and there is nothing of equal or greater probative weight in the evidence of record to contradict these credible lay accounts discernable and ongoing symptoms culminating in the above noted diagnosis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (each disabling condition for which a veteran seeks service connection must be considered based on factors including the basis of places, types, and circumstances of service as shown by service records).   Moreover, as to sleep apnea particularly, the Court reasoned in Maples v. Wilkie, No. 18-2016, 2019 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 199 (Feb. 11, 2019) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.), given the observable nature of its symptoms, sleep apnea is the type of disability for which lay evidence can be sufficient to support a claim for service connection.  The Board finds this reasoning persuasive.  Bethea, 2 Vet. App. 252.  Therefore, the in-service disease or injury requirement for sleep apnea has been met and continuous symptoms since service have been shown. 

Both the VA clinicians and private clinician of record (as noted above) rendered opinions as to secondary causation or toxic exposure.  While the VA clinicians rendered negative etiological opinions, the private clinician rendered a positive etiological opinion.  While the Board recognizes these clinician opinions as to secondary causation and toxic exposure, it finds (even in the case of the positive private opinion) that these clinicians discounted the credible lay evidence, as noted above, with the respective calculi of their opinions.  Due to the clinicians' discounting of the fulsome, consistent, and credible lay evidence, the Board finds these etiological opinions inadequate.  Buchanan, 451 F. 3d at 1336, n. 1 (the VA's clinician's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence").

While the Board could remand for an addendum opinion (to consider the credible lay evidence), such a remand might well be interpreted as an attempt to develop evidence with the intent of denying the Veteran's service connection claim, especially in light of the Veteran's competent, plausible, internally consistent, and credible accounts of his discernable symptoms from service through the present day.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim").  Moreover, to the extent that this grant of service connection is based upon credible lay evidence rather than positive medical opinions as to direct causation, "nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] requires both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself."  Buchanan, 451 F. 3d at 1335.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence is sufficient to decide this service connection claims, as it is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea had onset in service.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or the other is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

DM2, secondary to right knee strain with associated weight gain, on a causation basis

In November 2022, January 2023, and July 2023 VA examinations/opinions, clinicians rendered diagnoses of DM2.  Consequently, the current disability required has been met.

In May 2023, VA received a private medical report from clinician M.  This provider reviewed the Veteran's claims file, considered the Veteran's lay accounts of his medical history, and consulted research pertinent to sleep apnea and obesity.  The clinician reported that the Veteran's on-going, discernable left knee strain pain inhibited the Veteran's functional ability to lead an active lifestyle.  As a consequence, the Veteran gained over 100 pounds, and upon assessment has a body mass index (BMI) of 46.2-well within the obese range.  These consequential weight gain caused, or played a significant role in the acquisition of, DM2.  A compendium of peer reviewed literature was both referenced and appended to this clinician's opinion, to include a study focalized on the pathophysiology of DM2 related to weight gain.  Upon a holistic appraisal of the Veteran's medical history, this clinician rendered a positive etiological opinion as to the Veteran's DM2 and service connected left knee strain.  The clinician reported that but for the Veteran's left knee strain inhibiting left knee pain, the Veteran would not have become obese (BMI of 46.2); this marked obesity has been a substantial factor in the development of DM2.  Otherwise, stated, activity-limiting pain of the Veteran's left knee strain caused DM2 in a multi-link chain.  Indeed, the notion of obesity as "an intermediate step was highlighted by this thorough clinician.  The Board assigns significant probative weight to this opinion, the reasoning of which relies upon peer-reviewed studies and a thorough assessment of the Veteran's medical history and inability to lead an active lifestyle.  Here, the Board also notes that the Veteran's lay statements of record reflect how the pain of his left knee strain prohibited most forms of active movement and exercise.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning).

In the VA negative etiological opinions of record, the clinicians both minimized the Veteran's inhibiting left knee pain and focalized on toxic exposure.  Indeed, the clinicians collectively noted that the Veteran is obese, but, again collectively, they did not adequately consider whether this obesity (again, a BMI of 46.2) served as an "intermediate step" to the Veteran's acquisition of DM2 or whether the activity-limiting pain of the Veteran's left knee strain caused DM2 in a multi-link chain.  Indeed, the clinicians recapitulated evidence of record; however, they fail to draw causative multi-link associations between the pain of the Veteran's left knee strain, resultant obesity, and diagnosis of DM2.  Due to these deficits and flaws in reasoning, the Board assigns diminished weight to this battery of negative etiological opinions.  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304; Acevedo, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294

Thus, the evidence discussed above suffices to decide this service connection claim, as it is least as likely as not that the Veteran's DM2 was caused by the Veteran's service connected left knee strain, in a multi-link chain where obesity served as an intermediate step. As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence of record must be resolved in the Veteran's favor, entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's DM2 on a secondary, causation basis, is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
