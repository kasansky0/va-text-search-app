ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is dismissed.

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for herpes is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for urinary incontinence is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The August 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) is untimely with respect to the March 29, 2022 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for GERD; no good cause has been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing; and the Board's erroneous docketing of the appeal constitutes neither an explicit nor implicit waiver of timeliness.

2. The August 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) is untimely with respect to the May 5, 2021 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for herpes; no good cause has been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing; and the Board's erroneous docketing of the appeal constitutes neither an explicit nor implicit waiver of timeliness. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for GERD have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for herpes have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from March 1997 to April 2010. She received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with 4 Oak Leaf Clusters, Air Force Good Conduct Medal with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters, and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, among other awards and decorations. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from May 2021, March 2022, and March 2024 decisions of the VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). These decisions on appeal constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized appellate review system, known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) applies.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Based on the Veteran's selection of the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the respective evidence of record at the time of each May 2021, March 2022, and March 2024 AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any respective evidence submitted after each above-described AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim for entitlement to service connection for urinary incontinence, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

2. Entitlement to service connection for herpes.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for GERD and herpes. For the following reasons, these appeals must be dismissed.  

Under the AMA framework, a claimant has one year from the date that the AOJ mails notice of a decision to file a properly completed VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) to perfect an appeal to the Board. In some cases, an extension of the period for filing a Notice of Disagreement may be granted for good cause. A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b), (c). 

In this case, the AOJ issued a May 5, 2021 rating decision denying service connection for herpes and a March 29, 2022 rating decision denying service connection for GERD. The AOJ mailed notification letters regarding these decisions to the Veteran, then unrepresented, during the respective month of each rating decision with instructions for various review pathways and their corresponding one-year deadlines. The Veteran did not appeal either decision to the Board within the one-year deadline as indicated in these letters. See August 2024 Notice of Disagreement. Additionally, neither the Veteran nor her representative have submitted argument or evidence to support a finding of good cause to accept the August 2024 Notice of Disagreement as timely for these decisions. 

Unfortunately, considering this procedural history, the Board finds that the Veteran's August 2024 Notice of Disagreement was not received within the one-year period following notification of the May 5, 2021 and March 29, 2022 rating decisions, and good cause has not been shown to extend the time to file the form. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b), (c). Accordingly, the appeals for entitlement to service connection for GERD and herpes must be dismissed.

In making this decision, the Board has also considered whether it waived its right to enforce the filing deadline by virtue of docketing the appeals, but finds that no waiver, either implicit or explicit, has been made. After filing her Notice of Disagreement, the Board sent a letter acknowledging its receipt and placement of the appeals on the Direct Review docket consistent with her choice on the VA Form 10182. See August 2024 BVA docketing letter. The Board finds that this letter acknowledging receipt and the mere administrative act of assigning the attempted appeals on a docket, in and of themselves, do not constitute a waiver of timeliness. Rather, whether the Board has waived any objection to the timeliness of a Notice of Disagreement should be based on all facts and circumstances of that case. Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 334 ("If it dismisses his claim, the Board should identify the governing law, any formal defects in the appeal, whether waiver or forfeiture is a relevant consideration, and any other relevant factors."). Here, although the Board docketed these appeals as an automatic administrative action, there has been no additional action undertaken by VA to give the Veteran the impression that the merits of the case were being developed or examined in any substantive way.

The Board emphasizes that dismissal of these appeals is not based on consideration of whether the Veteran meets the legal requirements for entitlement to service connection for GERD or herpes, nor do these dismissals preclude the Veteran from further pursuing these claims with the AOJ. If she so chooses, the Board encourages the Veteran to work with her representative to submit a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify new and relevant lay or medical evidence in support of her claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for urinary incontinence.

The Veteran seeks service connection for urinary incontinence, which she asserts began in service and has continued since that time. See January 2024 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection on a direct basis generally requires competent and credible evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a "nexus," between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Under the AMA framework, the Board can remand a matter only for the correction of duty-to-assist errors that occurred prior to a decision on appeal, or for an AOJ error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correcting such an error could reasonably aid in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. 

In this regard, VA has a duty to provide a medical examination and opinion for a claim under certain circumstances. One such circumstance is when the record establishes there is sufficient evidence of a disability, evidence of an in-service event, injury, or disease, and an indication that there may be a nexus between the two. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006). Another such circumstance includes disability claims where there is evidence of a current disability, evidence of participation in toxic risk exposure activity (TERA), and the evidence of record is not otherwise sufficient to establish service connection for the disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1168. 

Turning to the Veteran's case, the AOJ has conceded the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show complaints and treatment for urinary incontinence; however, the AOJ determined she did not have a current disability. See March 2024 rating decision. 

Importantly, a layperson is competent to testify to observable facts. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994). Accordingly, lay evidence of facts supporting a diagnosis may not be categorically rejected as not competent solely because it was provided by a layperson. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (outlining the situations where lay evidence of a diagnosis is competent); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011) (recognizing that there is "no categorical requirement" that medical evidence be used to establish a diagnosis). Rather, the competency of lay evidence must be considered on a case-by-case basis, considering the nature of the claimed condition and whether lay evidence is competent in a particular case to establish the fact for which it was offered. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at n.4 ("Sometimes the layperson will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer."); Kahana, 24 Vet. App. at 433 n.4 ("When considering . . . lay evidence, the Board should determine, on a case-to-case basis, whether the [V]eteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence is competent.").

Here, the Veteran stated her urinary incontinence began in service around 2004, and that she still suffers from it. See January 2024 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. In service, as conceded by the AOJ, the Veteran sought treatment for these symptoms and the treatment provider noted the Veteran's "bladder incontinence." See June 2009 STR. It stands to reason the Veteran is competent to identify present urinary incontinence supporting a diagnosis the same as she did in service. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77. Moreover, the Board finds the Veteran's reports to be credible. See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995) ("Credible testimony is that which is plausible or capable of being believed."). 

As the AOJ has conceded the Veteran's STRs show complaints and treatment for urinary incontinence, and the Veteran's statements are competent and credible that she has current urinary incontinence, the criteria for a VA medical examination and opinion were met prior to the March 2024 decision on appeal. Therefore, the AOJ did not fulfill its duty to assist the Veteran in not so providing one. See McClendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83-86. 

Additionally, in January 2025, the AOJ associated the Veteran's Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER) with the record. The ILER indicates the Veteran's participation in TERA through her MOS duties. The Board notes there is no associated TERA memorandum of record. As detailed above, given there is evidence of current urinary incontinence and the Veteran's participation in TERA, and evidentiary record is not sufficient to establish service connection for this claim, VA has a statutory duty to provide a TERA examination and opinion. 38 U.S.C. § 1168. 

On remand, a VA examination and opinion must be provided, to include consideration of TERA.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. First, ensure the appropriate TERA memorandum is associated with the Veteran's claims file.

2. After completing the above development, schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of her urinary incontinence, to include consideration of TERA. After a review of the claims file, including a copy of this Remand, the examiner should address the following:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran, that her urinary incontinence is related to TERA.

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher), that the Veteran's urinary incontinence was otherwise incurred in or aggravated by her service. 

In making these opinions, the examiner should elicit a full history from the Veteran and consider the lay statements of record. The Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which she has first-hand knowledge, including the onset and development of symptoms. If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation for doing so.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for all opinions, citing to specific evidence of record and medical principles, as necessary.
