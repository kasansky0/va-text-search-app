DOCKET NO. 230106-311437
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The March 27, 2025, Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision which denied a rating higher than 10 percent for cervical strain from January 7, 2022, is vacated.

FINDING OF FACT

Following a request to switch to the Evidence Submission docket, the March 27, 2025, Board decision adjudicated the Veteran's appeal for a rating higher than 10 percent for cervical strain without notifying the Veteran of the docket switch and allowing the requisite 90-day window to submit additional evidence, thus denying the Veteran due process of law.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for vacating the March 27, 2025, Board decision which denied a rating higher than 10 percent for cervical strain have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Army from January 2018 to January 2022.

An initial rating decision was issued in January 2022; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In a January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket, which does not allow for the submission of additional evidence.  However, evidence was nonetheless added to the claims file in conjunction with the Veteran's appeal.  When a claimant elects the Direct Review option, but also submits evidence with a VA Form 10182, the Board has a regulatory duty to clarify the Veteran's intentions.  Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023).  To that end, the Board sent a letter to the Veteran seeking clarification on whether he want to change AMA dockets.

When the Veteran purportedly did not respond, the Board adjudicated his appeal in a March 12, 2025, decision.  However, the Veteran did, in fact, send a response in December 2024 indicating his intent to switch to the Evidence Submission docket.  This response was not processed by the time the Board issued its decision.  

The Board may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the appellant or his or her representative, or on the Board's own motion, when an appellant has been denied due process of law or when benefits were allowed based on false or fraudulent evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

The Board therefore vacated the March 12, 2025, decision, and issued a new decision on March 27, 2025, adjudicating the claim under the Evidence Submission docket and denying the claim.  However, the March 27, 2025, decision must also be vacated because the Veteran was not notified of the docket switch and not afforded the appropriate 90-day window to submit evidence following notification of the switch.  

Because the Veteran was not afforded his full due process rights, the Board vacates the March 27, 2025, decision denying a rating higher than 10 percent for cervical strain from January 7, 2022.
