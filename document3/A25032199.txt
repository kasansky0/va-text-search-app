REMANDED

Entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for the 2021 calendar year is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1974 to February 1975.  This matter  before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) was initiated by a February 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), in which the Veteran expressed disagreement with a January 2021 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration, identified the issue on appeal as "Clothing Allowance," and elected the Direct Review docket.  

The record in this case is missing documents including a copy of the decision on appeal and the Veteran's application for a clothing allowance.  It contains a "Statement of the Case" dated in January 2025, which indicates that the Veteran's clothing allowance claims were for knee braces.  However, it is unclear why this document was generated, as the claim and decision on appeal were apparently dated in January 2021, and the appeal has come to the Board through the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), in which Statements of the Case are not issued, rather than through the legacy review system, in which they were.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400(a)(1), 19.20, 20.201.

The record contains a "Missing Documents" Memorandum, dated February 8, 2025, indicating that the Veteran's clothing allowance application and a copy of the decision on appeal were unable to be obtained by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  However, it also contains a letter to the Veteran, issued the same date, informing him of the documents missing from his file and that the AOJ was taking steps ot rebuild the file to continue processing his appeal, and requesting that the Veteran submit "copies of any claims, decisions, or evidence or anything else that [he] would like to submit related to [his] appeal" to VA "within 60 days from the date of [the] notice."  

Decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record pursuant to applicable statutes and regulations.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(a), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  Furthermore, given that the Veteran, in his February 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), elected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Under the circumstances here, the Board cannot fulfill its statutory and regulatory requirement to base its decision on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, or even accurately assess the nature of the appeal, or the evidentiary period permitted to be reviewed.  Moreover, given the February 8, 2025, letter to the Veteran, the AOJ appears to still be developing the record.  

Furthermore, while, again, a January 2025 Statement of the Case is of record, this is not a legitimate procedural document in this matter and, given the absence of the Veteran's application for 2021 clothing allowances and notice of an AOJ decision to the Veteran, the record is unclear as to what appliances or medications were claimed and/or denied, and on what basis any might have been denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b) (requiring VA decision notice to include, among other things, identification of the issues adjudicated, a summary of the evidence considered by VA, identification of findings favorable to the claimant, and, in the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial).

The Board may remand for correction of any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Therefore, remand is warranted for the AOJ to associate with the electronic claim file all evidence and documentation relevant to the matter of an annual clothing allowance or allowances for the 2021 calendar year, to include the Veteran's application for benefits, and to provide the Veteran notice of its decision on his claim for clothing allowances for the 2021 calendar year in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the electronic claim file all evidence and documentation relevant to the matter of an annual clothing allowance or allowances for the 2021 calendar year, to include the Veteran's application for benefits.  Any unsuccessful attempts to obtain any such records must be clearly documented. 

2. Provide the Veteran notice of the decision on his claim for clothing allowances for the 2021 calendar year in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).  Such notice should include identification of the issues adjudicated-including what, if any, clothing allowances are denied-a summary of the evidence considered by VA, identification of findings favorable to the claimant, and, in the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial.
