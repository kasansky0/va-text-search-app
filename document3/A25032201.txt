ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for low back disability is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Without having shown good cause, the Veteran failed to report for a necessary medical examination scheduled for the purpose of determining entitlement to service connection for a low back disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran's failure to report for a necessary medical examination scheduled for the purpose of determining entitlement to service connection for a low back condition, and his failure to show good cause for that failure, necessitates that the supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection for a low back disability, be denied as a matter of law. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2003 to June 2008.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2024 decision.  In August 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2024 decision. However, the Veteran specifically appealed on his September 2024 VA Form 10182 the February 2024 rating decision. The Board notes that there is no prohibition against electing multiple AMA review options so long as the elections are not concurrent. Thus, the rating decision on appeal is the February 2024 rating decision specifically appealed in the September 2024 VA Form 10182. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 25-26 (2023).

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

On his September 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran untimely appealed a May 2012 rating decision for service connection for hypertension on the direct docket. However, in February 2025, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526 service connection claim for hypertension. Thus, that issue will be addressed in a separate decision at a later time.

Entitlement to service connection for a low back condition is denied. 

The Veteran seeks to reopen his claim for a lumbar spine condition (claimed as secondary to bilateral knee condition).  See September 2023 VA 20-0995 supplemental claim.

When entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination or reexamination, action shall be taken in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b) or (c), as appropriate. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (a).

When a claimant fails to report for a necessary medical examination in conjunction with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).  When the examination was scheduled in conjunction with any other original claim, a supplemental claim for a benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim for increase, the claim shall be denied. Id. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, illness or hospitalization of a claimant and death of an immediate family member. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a).

The burden rests upon VA to demonstrate that notice was sent to a claimant's last address of record and that the claimant lacked adequate reason or good cause for failing to report for a scheduled examination. Hyson v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 262, 265 (1993); see also Connolly v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 566 (1991). 

While VA has a duty to assist a veteran in obtaining information pertinent to their claim, the veteran has a duty to cooperate with VA in that development. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991) (noting that "[t]he duty to assist is not always a one-way street"). VA's duty must be understood as a duty to assist a veteran in developing their claim, rather than a duty to develop the entire claim with the veteran performing only a passive role. See Turk v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 565, 568 (2008). If a claimant wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may, or should, have information that is essential in obtaining relevant evidence. See Wood, 1 Vet. App. at 193; see also Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 178 (2005) (recognizing that "a veteran is free to refuse to report for a scheduled VA examination" but that "the consequences of that refusal may result in the adjudication of the matter based on the evidence of record").

In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the law presumes the regularity of the administrative process. Mindenhall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 271, 274 (1994) (citing Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 62, 64-65 (1992)). Notification for VA purposes is a written notice sent to the claimant's last address of record. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(q).

In October 2023, a VA examination pertaining to the Veteran's entitlement to service-connection for a low back condition was requested by the RO. See October 2023 exam request.  The examination was scheduled for November 9, 2023, correspondence addressed to the Veteran, notifying him of the scheduled examination, was sent on October 19, 2023.

The record reflects that the address to which the October 19, 2023, correspondence was sent is the updated/current address for the Veteran. The record of evidence reflects that the Veteran's address has remained unchanged since the Veteran's original October 2010 claim through his most recent February 2025 claim.  See February 2025 VA 21-526 claim, September 2024 VA 10182 notice of disagreement, September 2023 VA 20-0995 supplement claim, and October 2010 VA 21-526 claim.

A November 2023 exam scheduling request contention cancellation indicates that the Veteran was a no-show for his scheduled examination along with several other scheduled examinations.

A December 2023 VA subsequent development letter was mailed to the Veteran requesting a response regarding whether the Veteran was ready to report for the medical examinations that he had failed to show for previously.  See December 2023 subsequent development letter.  The record does not reflect any response from the Veteran or his representative.  

Significantly, there was no good cause presented prior to the rating decision on appeal. Here, an August 2024 HLR informal conference report with the Veteran was associated with the claims file after the rating decision on appeal.  This document is not evidence but rather a VA administrative document to confirm that an informal conference was conducted. The reviewer's notes reflect that the Veteran claimed good cause for missing other medical examinations but did not provide any reasons for his good cause claim.  In regard to the Veteran's low back condition the reviewer's notes reflect that the Veteran did not claim any good cause for missing his prior scheduled low back condition VA medical examination.

The record of evidence reflects that the Veteran's October 2010 claim for a low back condition was denied in a May 2012 rating decision due to the Veteran's failure to show for a VA scheduled medical examination.   See May 2012 rating decision.

Review of the record shows that correspondence, including correspondence attempting to schedule the Veteran for the necessary VA examination, was addressed to the Veteran's address of record prior to the November 2023 scheduled examination.

No VA correspondence have been shown to have been unsuccessfully delivered or returned to VA as undeliverable. Furthermore, the address of record for the Veteran when VA attempted to schedule his examination was the same address, he provided in all submissions to the VA.

There is no evidence of record to suggest that the address of record at the time the Veteran was sent notice of his scheduled examination was incorrect, that he was unaware of the scheduled examination, or that he was unable to attend the scheduled examination, and neither the Veteran nor his representative have provided good cause for his failure to appear at the appointed time. See October 2024, appellant's brief. The Board observes that the representative does not advance any reason for the Veteran's failure to report to his scheduled examination.

The VA's duty to assist the Veteran in developing his claim does not release the Veteran from any obligation to cooperate with its attempts to do so, including by ensuring VA is apprised of any reason he may be unable to attend an examination required to adjudicate his claim for entitlement to an increased rating. See Wood, 1 Vet. App. at 193; Turk, 21 Vet. App. at 568.

Given the evidence of record, including the multiple communications successfully delivered to the Veteran's address of record, the Board is satisfied that the Veteran did, in fact, receive proper notice of his examination scheduled for November 9, 2023, and simply did not cooperate in the development of his claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

The Board finds that VA made reasonable attempts to schedule the Veteran for a VA examination pursuant to his September 2023 supplement claim, that he received notice of these attempts, and that, notwithstanding such notice, did not cooperate in the development of his claim, resulting in not reporting for an examination, and has not shown good cause for not attending his examination.

The Board also finds that, without a VA examination as to the Veteran's low back condition, it is unable to determine whether he is entitled to service connection.  The record is absent any VA or private medical opinions regarding the Veteran's low back condition and the record is absent any lay statements or evidence to support the Veteran's September 2023 supplemental claim or May 2010 claim.

In conclusion, the Board finds, without having shown good cause, the Veteran failed to report for a necessary medical examination scheduled for the purpose of determining the etiology and entitlement to service connection for his low back condition. Accordingly, the Veteran's supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection for a low back condition must be denied as a matter of law. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).
