REMANDED

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 50 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with alcohol use disorder on or after June 22, 2023, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2009 to June 2013. 

This case comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in August 2024 and elected direct review.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the case, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Upon review, the Board finds that a remand is needed to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

There appear to be outstanding private treatment records.  In this regard, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-414a in August 2023 and November 2023.  However, it does not appear any attempt was made to obtain such records following the most recent authorization.  Nor is there any documentation indicating why an attempt was not made.  Therefore, on remand, the AOJ should attempt to obtain any outstanding medical records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) should request that the Veteran provide the names and addresses of any and all health care providers who have provided treatment for his service connected acquired psychiatric disability.  A specific request should be made for records from Dr. E.C. (identified in a November 2023 VA Form 21-414a).  After acquiring this information and obtaining any necessary authorization, the AOJ should obtain and associate these records with the claims file.

The AOJ should also obtain any outstanding VA medical records.
