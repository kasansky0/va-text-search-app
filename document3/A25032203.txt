DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ambulance services incurred on July 20, 2020, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The ambulance services the Veteran received on July 20, 2020, involved emergency on scene treatment by emergency personnel before death occurred.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA ambulance services incurred on July 20, 2020, have been met. ?38 U.S.C. §§ 1725;?38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1003(a)(2).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from December 1954 to December 1958. The Veteran died in July 2020.

This appeal is before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) from a September 2020 determination by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The appellant, Calhoun County EMS, is the private ambulance provider. 

In the March 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. §?20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The appellant is seeking reimbursement or payment for a non-VA ambulance charge from Calhoun County EMS. In the September 2020 Explanation of Payment, VA denied the claim based on the following: 

Medical records have not been received or are insufficient to determine decision of payment. If applicable, please submit the ambulance trip notes, ER Report, H&P notes, progress notes, and discharge summary within 30 days. If records are not received your claim will be considered abandoned. You may request additional time, which may extend this time limit as reasonably necessary. Please utilize electronic claim and record submission capabilities to resubmit the claim with the requested medical documentation. If you lack the ability to submit claims and records electronically, please mail the documents to the appropriate claims processing center.

Review of the medical records reflect that on July 20, 2020, Calhoun County EMS was called to the Veteran's nursing home after he was found unresponsive on the floor. The emergency personnel tried to resuscitate the Veteran for approximately twenty minutes, and he remained unresponsive, ultimately determining a time of death. The notes reflect that the Veteran was deceased on arrival. Calhoun County EMS did not transport the Veteran to a non-VA medical facility. 

There is no indication or allegation in the record that payment of the cost of the services provided by the?ambulance were authorized in advance. Two statutes allow for potential payment for non-VA?ambulance?services when payment for such transportation has not been pre-authorized,?38 U.S.C. § 1728?and?38 U.S.C. §?1725. 

In this case, at the time of the episode of care on appeal, the Veteran was service-connected for bilateral hearing loss at 30 percent. As such, the Veteran does not have a total and permanent service-connected disability rating. Likewise, the services he received were not for any injury or illness incurred in relation to participation in a vocational rehabilitation program. Consequently, he does not have potential eligibility for payment or?reimbursement?for the services provided by the?ambulance?personnel under?38 U.S.C. § 1728. See?38 C.F.R. § 17.120. 

Nonetheless, VA payment or?reimbursement?for non-VA emergency transportation may be considered under?38 U.S.C. § 1725. See?38 C.F.R. § 17.1003. When the elements of?38 U.S.C. § 1725 are met, VA shall?reimburse?the appellant for the reasonable value of emergency treatment furnished in a non-Department facility. VA regulations at?38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000?through 17.1008 constitute the requirements under?38 U.S.C. § 1725?that govern VA payment or reimbursement for non-VA emergency services furnished to a veteran for nonservice-connected conditions. 

A threshold requirement for payment or?reimbursement?under this legal authority is that the Veteran was transported to a non-VA facility for emergency medical treatment. 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1003. While this provision speaks to "transportation," it contemplates payment where "[d]eath has not occurred before emergency treatment could be provided." 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1003(a)(2). Here, the emergency personnel responded to an emergency call and provided emergency treatment for 20 minutes in an attempt to revive the Veteran. There is a note reflecting that the Veteran was deceased on arrival, but he was not officially declared dead and emergency personnel believed that attempts at revival was medically reasonable. The Board finds that death had not occurred before emergency treatment could be provided, and the requirements for payment under 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1003. The claim is granted.
