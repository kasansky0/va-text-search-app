ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed bilateral hearing loss is related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5103(a), 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from January 1968 to January 1970. 

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran generally contends he is entitled to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. 

Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021). If "the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance (which includes but is not limited to equipoise) the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt." Id.

Here, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss. Additionally, the April 2023 VA examination shows hearing loss for VA purposes. The AOJ also found that the Veteran had in-service acoustic trauma based on his job as a radio mechanic. Therefore, the first and second elements of service connection are met.

The question then becomes whether a nexus, or relationship, between the Veteran's current hearing loss disability and the Veteran's in-service noise exposure has been shown.

In this case, the evidence contains conflicting opinions regarding the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and its relationship to service.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2019. After confirming a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss, the examiner opined that it was less likely as not related to service indicating that the Veteran's hearing loss existed prior to service. Upon review of the record the Board finds the examiner's opinion is based on an inaccurate factual premise, specifically, that the Veteran experienced preexisting hearing loss. See Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60 (2018); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (An opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value). The Board notes that the Veteran's July 1967 pre-induction enlistment examination shows hearing loss in the left ear, but not for VA purposes under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. As such, the Veteran is presumed sound at enlistment. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993). Accordingly, this opinion is not probative.

In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a private hearing loss evaluation form which did not include a rationale for the examiners determination that the Veteran's hearing loss was related to service. Accordingly, this opinion is not probative.

The Veteran submitted a private examination report dated in December 2020 where the examiner indicated that they reviewed the Veteran's military service records. The examiner noted that the Veteran exposure to noise during service.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was at least as likely as not related to his in-service noise exposure. Finally, the examiner cited to medical literature showing that progressive or delayed-onset hearing loss is common with the type of acoustic trauma experienced by the Veteran. The Board finds the December 2020 private opinion of record probative as the private examiner reviewed the claims file, discussed the medical literature in relation to the Veteran's specific risk factors, and supported their opinions with adequate rationale. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2022. After confirming a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss, the examiner opined that it was less likely as not related to service indicating that there was no permanent auditory damage on active duty from conceded noise. The examiner stated the Veteran's hearing loss existed prior to service and was not aggravated beyond normal progression 

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in April 2023. After confirming a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss, the examiner opined that it was less likely as not related to service. The examiner indicated the Veteran's hearing loss existed prior to service and with regard to the issue of continuity of symptomatology for hearing loss stated the Veteran's hearing was noted as within normal limits bilaterally upon separation from service.

Upon review of the record the Board finds the examiners opinions are based on an inaccurate factual premise, specifically, that the Veteran experience preexisting hearing loss. See Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60 (2018); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (An opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value). Accordingly, the March 2022 and April 2023 opinions are not probative.

The Board finds no adequate reason to favor the negative opinions over the positive December 2020 opinion that is favorable to the Veteran's claim. Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss is related to service. Therefore, the third element of service connection is met. 

Based on the foregoing, and resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
