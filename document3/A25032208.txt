REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from July 2008 to September 2018.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In the rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the above claims.  As the rating of the 6 matters on appeal was rendered pursuant to a January 7, 2024, VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request - Higher Level Review (HLR), the evidentiary window closed with the issuance of the prior rating decision of January 31, 2023.

In the body of the May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ wrote:

We received your request for [an HLR] with an informal conference on January 7, 2024. We attempted to reach you for the informal conference on May 2, 2024. and May 7, 2024.  

Consequently, an informal conference did not take place.

Moreover, the AOJ wrote:

The issues of low back and erectile dysfunction are on the [HLR], received January 7, 2024, and the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (BVA) also received January 7, 2024.  In response to the BVA letter. dated January 24, 2024, you clarified that low back and erectile dysfunction are to be reviewed by BVA.  Therefore, those issues are not considered in the higher level review decision below.  An issue can only be in one claim at a time.

Therefore, docket number 240527-443711 is limited to the 6 matters above.

In his May 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decision, as qualified above, on appeal. 

If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  

If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

Service Connection 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service incurrence of a disease or injury; and (3) a relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F. 3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The Veteran has raised entitlement based upon secondary causation, more specifically that the Veteran's claimed disabilities were caused by the certain of the Veteran's service connected musculoskeletal disabilities.  Considering the instant favorable decision to grant service connection on a direct basis for these 6 claims, as explained below, a discussion of any other theory of entitlement is not necessary, as such would not result in an earlier effective date.  Cf. Johnson v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-7589, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 383 (Mar. 26, 2025) (indicating that effective date consequences can be considered by the Board in cases in which the issue before it is entitlement to service connection); Stender v. Wilkie, No. 19-0068, 2020 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 520, *5-*7 (Mar. 27, 2020) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) (the Board erred in granting service connection based on the Camp Lejeune Contaminated Water (CLCW) presumption without considering other theories of entitlement that could warrant an earlier effective date because of the effective date of the CLCW presumption); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

Cervical strain; left elbow disability; left hip disability; left knee disability; right ankle disability; and right shoulder disability

In a December 2022 VA cervical spine conditions examination report, a clinician rendered a diagnosis of cervical strain.  Although the evidence of record does not contain formal diagnoses of either a left elbow disability, a left hip disability, a left knee disability, right ankle disability, or a right shoulder disability, pain alone is sufficient in some circumstances to reflect the existence of left elbow, left hip, left knee, right ankle, and right shoulder disabilities.  See Saunders, 886 F. 3d at 1364-65) (a diagnosis is not required to meet the current disability requirement and pain alone can constitute disability if it causes impairment in earning capacity).  The Veteran's competent and credible lay statements reflect that he experiences on-going discernable left elbow, left hip, left knee, right ankle, and right shoulder pain that causes impairment in earning capacity.  Therefore, the current disability requirements for the 6 disabilities listed on the title page have been met.

The Veteran has competently reported that repeated impact of 47 static-line parachute jumps, and the rigorous exercise and lower extremity trauma of basic training protocols caused significant discernable pain while in active duty service.  This significant multi-joint pain has been on-going-has continued unabatedly through the present day.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (a veteran is competent to testify regarding observations); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1337 (holding lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence).  Specifically, the Board finds that the Veteran's competent lay accounts made to VA providers and associated with the evidence of record, as to these respectful disabilities, to be plausible, internally consistent, and consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of service, and there is nothing of equal or greater probative weight in the evidence of record to contradict this account of his discernable and ongoing symptoms culminating in the above noted diagnoses.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (each disabling condition for which a veteran seeks service connection must be considered based on factors including the basis of places, types, and circumstances of service as shown by service records).  Therefore, the in-service disease or injury requirement for these 6 disabilities has been met and continuous symptoms since service have been shown.

In addition to the December 2022 VA cervical spine conditions examination, the Veteran reported for a contemporaneous battery of examinations and a battery of examinations in 2020 focalized on other joints (left hip, left knee, right ankle, and right shoulder).  The clinician provided a negative etiological opinion as to the cervical strain based upon the absence of more than one notation as to a neck complaint in service (and an absence of medical records reflecting chronicity of neck care).  As to the left hip, left knee, right ankle, and right shoulder, the clinicians based negative etiological opinions of the lack of diagnoses discernable on the days of the respective examinations.  Even though these clinicians included the Veteran's plausible, competent, and credible accounts of the in-service joint injuries and on-going discernable pain (productive of functional loss in earning capacity), the clinicians jettisoned consideration of this fulsome evidence in their negative etiological opinions.  Consequently, these negative etiological opinions as to these 5 disabilities are inadequate.  Buchanan, 451 F. 3d at 1336, n. 1 (in the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "[l]ay statements [can present] sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the veteran's] disability such that [her claims] for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence").

The Veteran has not been afforded a VA left elbow examination but one is not required given the credible accounts of in-service left elbow pain and its ongoing discernable symptoms since service culminating in the current disability of left elbow pain causing impairment in earning capacity. 

While the Board could remand for addendum opinions, such a remand could well be construed as an attempt to develop evidence with the intent of denying the Veteran's 6 service connection claim, especially in light of the Veteran's competent, plausible, internally consistent, and credible accounts of his ongoing discernable and extensive symptoms (of each respective disability), from service through the present day.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim").  

To the extent that these 6 grants of service connection are based primarily on credible lay evidence rather than complete medical opinions, "nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] requires both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself."  Buchanan, 451 F. 3d at 1335.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence is sufficient to decide the Veteran's service connection claims, as it is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's cervical strain, left elbow disability, left hip disability, left knee disability, right ankle disability, and right shoulder disability each had onset in service.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection is warranted for these disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or the other is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
