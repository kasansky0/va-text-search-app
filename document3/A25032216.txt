ORDER

The March 2023 supplemental claim of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), including as secondary to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), was properly filed.

REMANDED

Service connection for OSA, including as secondary to PTSD, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a March 31, 2022 decision issued under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board denied service connection for OSA, including as secondary to PTSD.

2. On March 20, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim of service connection for OSA, including as secondary to PTSD, most recently addressed in a March 31, 2022 Board decision. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran's March 2023 supplemental claim of service connection for OSA was properly filed and received within one year of notice of the March 2022 Board decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(c)(3), 3.2501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Marine Corps from August 1988 to May 1991.

On March 20, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim of service connection for OSA, including as secondary to PTSD, most recently addressed in a March 31, 2022 Board decision. 

In a November 9, 2023 letter, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) declined to adjudicate the March 2023 supplemental claim of service connection for sleep apnea. The AOJ stated that for VA to begin processing the Veteran's claim for compensation, he must complete, sign, and return a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, or submit his claim through eBenefits. The AOJ stated, "On your VA Form 20-0995 dated 05/03/2023, you claimed SLEEP APNEA SECONDARY TO PTSD, but it was not a previously SC or Denied contention you have ever claimed before. When filing for a new contention, you have to file the claim on required form such as VA Form 21-526EZ."

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket and appealed the November 9, 2023 AOJ letter, asserting that the November 9, 2023 AOJ letter constitutes an AOJ decision to refuse to process his validly filed supplemental claim. 

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

In a June 2024 decision issued under the legacy appeals system, the Board granted service connection for PTSD. This decision was effectuated in a June 2024 AOJ decision, which granted service connection for PTSD effective October 21, 2011.

1. Whether a March 2023 supplemental claim of service connection for OSA, including as secondary to PTSD, was properly filed

In February 2020, a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim of service connection for a sleep disorder was received from the Veteran, and the AOJ reconsidered and denied that claim in an April 2020 rating decision. 

In an April 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket and appealed the April 2020 rating decision. 

At a November 2020 Board hearing, the Veteran asserted that his claim of service connection for a sleep disorder included OSA, and asserted that his OSA is secondary to PTSD.

In a March 31, 2022 decision, the Board denied entitlement to service connection for OSA, including as secondary to PTSD, which was not yet service-connected.

On March 20, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim of service connection for OSA, including as secondary to PTSD, most recently addressed in a March 31, 2022 Board decision. 

In a November 9, 2023 letter, the AOJ declined to adjudicate the March 2023 supplemental claim of service connection for sleep apnea, as indicated above.

In the September 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran asserted that the November 9, 2023 VA letter constitutes an AOJ decision to refuse to process his validly filed supplemental claim. 

The Board agrees, and finds that it has jurisdiction of the appeal of the November 9, 2023 rejection of the Veteran's March 2023 supplemental appeal. The Board has authority to decide all questions pertaining to its jurisdictional authority to review a particular case. 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c). Moreover, the Court of Appeals for Veterans claims (Court) has held that a letter from the Board to an appellant declining to docket his VA Form 10182 was a Board "decision" over which the Court could exercise jurisdiction. The Board's letter, the Court explained, was a "decision" because, "the letter (1) is in writing; (2) contains the Board's finding and conclusion, i.e., that the Board could not process the appellant's appeal; (3) contains a statement of reasons or bases explaining that the appellant can choose only one review option per issue; and (4) denied an earlier effective date by refusing to docket his appeal." Cardoza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 407, 412 (2024).

Although this case concerns a letter from the AOJ while Cardoza concerned a letter from the Board, both entities, as the Court indicated, issue decisions under 38 U.S.C. § 511 (a) - i.e., decisions, "under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans." Id. at 411 (quoting the statute). Like the Board's letter in Cardoza, the AOJ's November 2023 letter was in writing; contained a finding and conclusion (the AOJ could not process his claim); provided a reason (the Veteran filed the incorrect form and should use a different form); and had the effect of not processing his claim for benefits until he submitted a new form, which if accepted would result in a later effective date. 

An appeal consists of a notice of disagreement timely filed to the Board on any issue for which VA provided notice of a decision affecting provision of benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.4. The Veteran's notice of disagreement was timely filed, as it was received within one year of the November 9, 2023 letter.

At any time after VA issues notice of a decision on an issue within a claim, a claimant may file a supplemental claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(2). Following notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board, the claimant may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(3).

In this case, on March 20, 2023, within one year of notice of the March 2022 Board decision, VA received the Veteran's properly filed VA Form 20-0995, in which he requested readjudication of the claim of service connection for OSA, including as secondary to PTSD, most recently addressed in a March 31, 2022 Board decision. The Veteran submitted additional evidence with his supplemental claim. Accordingly, the claim was properly filed and the AOJ must adjudicate this supplemental claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Service connection for OSA, including as secondary to PTSD, is remanded.

The Board finds that the AOJ's failure to adjudicate the March 2023 supplemental claim of service connection for OSA, including as secondary to service-connected PTSD, was an error in satisfying regulatory and statutory duties, and that correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).
