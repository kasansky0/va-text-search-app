FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  Prior to April 22, 2022, the Veteran's GERD with hiatal hernia was not productive of persistently recurrent epigastric distress or symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health.

2.  Since April 22, 2022, the Veteran's GERD with hiatal hernia has not been productive of material weight loss, hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or symptoms combination productive of severe impairment of health.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for GERD with a hiatal hernia prior to April 22, 2022, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7399-7346.

2.  The criteria for entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for GERD on or after April 22, 2022, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7399-7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1990 to July 1994.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 higher-level review decision of a December 2022 rating decision.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA 10182 and elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision, which was subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued this decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included in this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the issues of entitlement to an increased evaluation for asthma and for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, any evidence that the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in adjudication of those claims.  C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Law and Analysis

The Veteran and his representative have not raised any issues with the pre-decisional duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issues decided herein. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

The Veteran's GERD with hiatal hernia is currently assigned a 10 percent evaluation prior to April 22, 2022, and a 30 percent evaluation thereafter, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7399-7346.

Hyphenated diagnostic codes including a diagnostic code ending in the digits "99" are used when there is no specifically applicable diagnostic code, and the disability is rated by analogy; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

The Board notes that VA amended some of the criteria for rating the digestive system effective from May 19, 2024. See 89 Fed. Reg. 19735 (March 20, 2024). However, consideration under the revised schedular criteria should not be undertaken before such criteria became effective.  The effective date rule contained in 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) prevents the application of a later, liberalizing law to a claim prior to the effective date of the liberalizing law.  That is, for any date prior to May 19, 2024, neither the AOJ nor the Board could apply the revised rating schedule.  As the amended criteria became effective after the appeal period in this case, they are not applicable.

Under the version of Diagnostic Code 7346 in effect during the appeal period, a 10 percent evaluation is assigned for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.  A 60 percent evaluation is contemplated for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

Governing regulations provide that there are diseases of the digestive system, particularly with the abdomen, which, while differing in the site of pathology, produce a common disability picture characterized in the main by varying degrees of abdominal distress or pain, anemia, and disturbances in nutrition.  Consequently, certain coexisting diseases in this area, as indicated in the instruction under the title "Diseases of the Digestive System," do not lend themselves to distinct and separate disability evaluations without violating the fundamental principle relating to pyramiding. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.14, 4.113.

Ratings under Diagnostic Codes 7301 to 7329, inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348, inclusive, will not be combined with each other.  A single evaluation will be assigned under the Diagnostic Code that reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114

Prior to April 22, 2022

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for his service-connected GERD with a hiatal hernia prior to April 22, 2022.  

The evidence does not show that the Veteran had persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal pain, productive of considerable impairment of health during this time period.  In fact, an August 2020 VA examiner specifically found that he did not have persistently recurrent epigastric distress or symptoms productive of considerable of impairment of health.  Although he was noted as having dysphagia, pyrosis, regurgitation, and substernal arm pain, those symptoms are contemplated in the currently assigned 10 percent evaluation.  Indeed, Diagnostic Code 7346 specifically provides that a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  A November 2020 VA examination also found that the Veteran did not have persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.

The Board acknowledges that an April 2019 VA treatment record documented the Veteran's report that he had "a lot of GERD symptoms," but the specific symptoms were not identified.  Moreover, VA treatment records dated in March 2019, February 2020, September 2020, and February 2021 indicate that the Veteran was not experiencing any vomiting.  An April 2021 VA treatment record further documents that his GERD "still comes back sometimes" and noted that it gets really bad with certain foods.  However, the evidence does not persuasively show that he has persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.  

In an effort to afford the Veteran the highest possible rating, the Board has also considered whether any other rating criteria are applicable.  However, other diagnostic codes available under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 are not for application because the Veteran's condition does not more closely approximate a disorder of the pancreas, liver, gall bladder, etc.  Nor does the Veteran's disorder cause esophageal stricture, spasm, or diverticulum, such that Diagnostic Codes 7203-7205 would apply.  Moreover, as previously noted, ratings under Diagnostic Codes 7301 to 7329, inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348, inclusive, will not be combined with each other.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent prior to April 22, 2022, for his service-connected GERD with a hiatal hernia.

On or After April 22, 2022

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for his service-connected GERD with a hiatal hernia on or after to April 22, 2022.  

The evidence does not show that the Veteran has material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  In fact, despite noting pain and vomiting that occurs less than one day per year as well as other symptoms contemplated in the rating criteria for a 10 or 30 percent evaluation, an April 2022 VA examination found that he did not have material weight loss, hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or symptoms combination productive of severe impairment of health.  Therefore, the Board finds that an evaluation in excess of 30 percent is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7346. 

The Board again finds that other diagnostic codes available under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 are not for application because the Veteran's condition does not more closely approximate a disorder of the pancreas, liver, gall bladder, etc.  Nor does the Veteran's disorder cause esophageal stricture, spasm, or diverticulum, such that Diagnostic Codes 7203-7205 would apply.  Moreover, as previously noted, ratings under Diagnostic Codes 7301 to 7329, inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348, inclusive, will not be combined with each other.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent on or after to April 22, 2022, for his service-connected GERD with hiatal hernia.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Upon review, the Board finds that a remand is needed to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors for the remaining issues on appeal.

In a December 2022 decision, the Board granted entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, noting that there was a June 2002 medical record documenting the latter diagnosis.  The AOJ implemented that decision and assigned a assigned a 10 percent evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected allergic rhinitis and sinusitis effective from December 14, 2012, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic 6522 (allergic or vasomotor rhinitis).  His representative has asserted that he should be granted a separate evaluation for sinusitis. See October 2023 VA Form 20-0996.  The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2022, but the examiner only addressed allergic rhinitis.  It is unclear as to whether the examiner had only found allergic rhinitis upon examination or if sinusitis was not evaluated at that time.  Therefore, the Board finds that an additional examination was needed.

The Board also notes that a September 2021 VA examiner found that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of asthma.  However, a note to Diagnostic 6602 provides that, in the absence of clinical findings of asthma at time of examination, a verified history of asthmatic attacks must be of record. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.  Thus, given that the Veteran was prescribed an albuterol rescue inhaler for asthma in January 2016, the Board finds that a retrospective opinion is needed to address the earlier time period on appeal.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  The Veteran should be afforded a VA examination to ascertain the current severity and manifestations of his service-connected allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.  Any studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file.

It should be noted that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.

The examiner should report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.  In particular, he or she should indicate whether there are any polyps.

The examiner should also address whether the Veteran has sinusitis detected by x-ray only; the number of incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment; and the number of non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.  He or she should also indicate whether there has been radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis, or near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain and tenderness of affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries.

It should be noted that an incapacitating episode of sinusitis means one that requires bed rest and treatment by a physician.

To the extent possible, the examiner should distinguish between which symptoms are attributable to the Veteran's service-connected allergic rhinitis and his service-connected sinusitis.  If the examiner is unable to distinguish the symptomatology, he or she should so state in the report and provide an explanation.

A clear rationale should be provided for all opinions.

2.  The Veteran should be afforded a VA examination to ascertain the severity and manifestations of his service-connected asthma for the period from December 14, 2012, to June 2, 2020.  

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with he claims file. 

The examiner should note that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.

For the period from December 14, 2012, to June 2, 2020, the examiner should address whether there was a verified history of asthmatic attacks.  He or she should also address whether the Veteran required intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy; daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy; inhalational anti-inflammatory medication; at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations; and intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids.  The examiner should further indicate whether the Veteran had more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure; or required daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immuno-suppressive medications.

In addition, the examiner should address whether it is possible to provide or estimate the FEV-1 percent predicted and FEV-1/FVC for the period from December 14, 2012, to June 2, 2020.  In so doing, he or she discuss whether the available pulmonary function tests may be indicative of his functioning during this time period. See e.g., July 2015 PFT results.

A clear rationale should be provided for all opinions.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
