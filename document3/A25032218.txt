ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for allergic rhinitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran has not been shown to have a sinus disorder since he filed his claim or within close proximity thereto.

2.  The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is not productive of any nasal obstruction or polyps.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  A sinus disorder was not incurred in active service and may not be presumed to have been so incurred. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1119, 1120 (as amended by the PACT Act, Pub. L. 117-168 (Aug. 10, 2022)); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.320.

2.  The criteria for an initial compensable evaluation for allergic rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1998 to March 2006 in the United States Air Force and from January 2007 to June 2019 in the United States Army.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in August 2024 and elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider any evidence submitted after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal.  If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Law and Analysis

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the pre-decisional duty to notify or duty to assist. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Effective August 5, 2021, VA amended its regulations to establish presumptive service connection for three chronic respiratory diseases associated with presumed exposure to fine particulate matter, including sinusitis. 86 Fed. Reg. 42724 (Aug. 5, 2021) (interim final rule codified at 38 C.F.R. § 3.320).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.320, service connection shall be granted for certain chronic diseases associated with exposure to fine particulate matter even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of military service if it becomes manifest to any degree (including non-compensable) following separation from a qualifying period of military service.  A veteran who has a qualifying period of service shall be presumed to have been exposed to fine particulate matter during such service, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to fine particulate matter during that service.  The term "qualifying period of service" means any period of active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(2), during the Persian Gulf War as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2 (i); or, in Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti, or Uzbekistan on or after September 19, 2001, during the Persian Gulf War as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2(i).  The disease shall not be presumed service-connected if there is affirmative evidence that: (1) the disease was not incurred during or aggravated by a qualifying period of service; or, (2) the disease was caused by a supervening condition or event that occurred between the veteran's most recent departure from a qualifying period of service and the onset of the disease; or, (3) the disease is the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct.

Under the PACT Act, unless affirmative evidence establishing otherwise, any covered veteran is presumed to have been exposed to certain substances, chemicals, and airborne hazards during their service.  A "covered veteran" means any veteran who on or after August 2, 1990, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, or United Arab Emirates; or on or after September 11, 2001, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Uzbekistan, or any other country determined relevant by the Secretary. When certain diseases diagnosed after service, including chronic sinusitis, manifest in a covered veteran, such disability shall be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated during active military, naval, air, or space service, notwithstanding that there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120 (as amended by the PACT Act, Pub. L. 117-168 (Aug. 10, 2022)).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for a sinus disorder.

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran has been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis for which he has already been granted service connection. 

The Veteran's service treatment records show that was diagnosed with acute sinusitis in November 2013 and was provided treatment for his symptoms.  Those records also show the Veteran's sinuses did not have tenderness in November 2014, and during the Veteran's retirement examination, it was reported that his sinuses were normal. 

In May 2019, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection for sinusitis.  The examiner diagnosed him with allergic rhinitis, but did not render a diagnosis of sinusitis. 

In November 2021, another VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with allergic rhinitis, but again did not diagnose him with sinusitis.

In July 2023, a VA examiner confirmed a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and determined that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of sinusitis. 

There are also no treatment records showing that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a sinus disorder since he filed his claim or within close proximity thereto.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has claimed that that he has a sinus disorder that it is related to his military service.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), as to the specific issue in this case, the diagnosis and etiology of a sinus disorder, falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person, particularly given the other diagnoses to which his symptoms have been attributed. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Moreover, even assuming the Veteran's lay assertions regarding the diagnosis and etiology are competent, the Board nevertheless finds that the opinion of the VA examiner is of greater probative weight than the Veteran's general lay assertions in this regard.  The examiner reviewed the claims file, considered the Veteran's own reported history and assertions, performed an examination, and relied on her own training, knowledge, and expertise to form the opinion.

The Board notes that the requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim, even in cases where the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321-323 (2007).  However, in this case, the evidence does not show that the Veteran had sinusitis at the time the supplemental claim was filed in June 2023 or during the pendency of the appeal.  Indeed, a diagnosis of acute sinusitis was most recently made in November 2013, which was approximately 10 years prior to the filing of the claim. 

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  Evidence must show that the Veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed. 

Because the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a sinus disorder, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted, and discussion of the remaining elements is not necessary. See Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006) (the absence of any one element will result in denial of service connection).

Increased Evaluation

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509- 10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

The Veteran is currently assigned a noncompensable evaluation for his allergic rhinitis pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

Under Diagnostic Code 6522, a 10 percent evaluation is assigned for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps.  A 30 percent evaluation is the maximum schedular evaluation possible for allergic rhinitis under Diagnostic Code 6522.

Where a diagnostic code does not provide a zero percent rating, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an increased evaluation for his service-connected allergic rhinitis at any time during the pendency of the appeal.

The evidence does not show that the Veteran has a greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  Nor has he been shown to have polyps.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2023 during which he reported having sinus pressure, a runny and stuffy nose, a sore throat, and a cough.  A physical examination revealed permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, but there was not a complete obstruction or 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on either side.  There were also no nasal polyps or other pertinent symptoms found upon examination.

The Board also notes that May 2019 and November 2021 VA examiners had found that the Veteran did not have a 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, a complete obstruction on either side, or nasal polyps.  

In addition, there are no treatment records showing that the Veteran has polyps or a nasal obstruction.  Therefore, an increased evaluation is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 6522.

The Board further finds that a higher or separate rating is not warranted under any other potentially applicable Diagnostic Code.  In this regard, in Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 338 (2015), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that when a condition is specifically listed in the rating schedule, it may not be rated by analogy. See also Suttmann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 127, 134 (1993) (providing that "[a]n analogous rating... may be assigned only where the service-connected condition is 'unlisted.'").  Thus, as the Veteran's allergic rhinitis is specifically listed in the Rating Schedule under Diagnostic Code 6522, such disability may not be rated by analogy.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the increased rating claim adjudicated herein. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
