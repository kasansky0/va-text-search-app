FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's bilateral flatfoot was noted upon entry into service and was not aggravated by service. 

2. The evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's current neck arthritis began during active service or is otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease. 

3. The evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has PTSD that began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease. 

4. The evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has radiculopathy of the right upper extremity that began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease. 

5. The evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has radiculopathy of the left upper extremity that began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease. 

6. The Veteran's umbilical hernia condition is not manifested by symptoms showing that the hernia is not well supported by a belt under ordinary conditions, or by a weakening of the abdominal wall and an indication for a supporting belt. 

7. The Veteran's right inguinal hernia has manifested as postoperative without evidence of recurrence.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2000 to December 2006.

In December 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the rating decision on appeal denying service connection for arthritis of the neck, PTSD, and radiculopathy of the upper extremities, and compensable ratings for umbilical hernia and right inguinal hernia.

In a January 2023 decision, the AOJ denied service connection for bilateral flatfoot.  

In a November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, with respect to issues of service connection for arthritis of the neck, PTSD, and radiculopathy of the upper extremities, and compensable ratings for umbilical hernia and right inguinal hernia, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the December 2022 decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

With respect to the bilateral flatfoot claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the January 2023 decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, the Board notes that 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 provides that a veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim. Notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing was not provided in this case prior to AOJ's initial adjudications in December 2022 and January 2023.  In Bowen, however, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested hearing before the AOJ because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a hearing before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253 (2012). Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket in the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) that he signed. The Veteran selected Direct Docket review by a Veterans Law Judge, and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, the veteran does not want a Board hearing. Because he was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation. Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.  

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). To establish service connection for a disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 38 F3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic (reliably diagnosed) in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). The requirement of a current disability is satisfied when a veteran has a disability at the time he files his service connection claim or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). However, when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of the diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).

Pain may be considered a disability for VA purposes if it results in a functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir., 2018).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of observable symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009). When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).

The Board is mindful of 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b), whereunder the in-service element of a service-connection claim may be relaxed in the case of a veteran who has asserted service connection for injuries incurred in combat. Section 1154 (b) allows a combat veteran to use satisfactory lay or other evidence to establish that he was injured or incurred a disability while on active duty, even in cases where there is no official record that such injury or disability occurred. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (b). The statute, moreover, specifically provides that the VA must resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran when determining whether a combat veteran incurred a particular injury or disability while in active service. Id. However, 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (b) does not eliminate the need for evidence of a nexus; it merely reduces, for veterans who have engaged in combat with the enemy, the burden of presenting evidence of incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease in service. Collette v. Brown, 82 F.3d 389, 392 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  

In this case, the December 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable finding: "Your military personnel records for the period of June 2000 through December 2006 show that you served in a combat zone."  Despite having served in a 'combat zone, the Board observes that the Veteran's DD Form 214 and personnel records show that he is not in receipt of an award or decoration indicative of combat or having engaged in combat with the enemy.  The Veteran in this case is not considered to be a combat veteran such that 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (b) is applicable.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral flatfoot

The Veteran essentially contends that his bilateral flatfoot (also known as pes planus), which was assessed upon entry into service, was aggravated by service.

The January 2023 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable finding: "You have been diagnosed with a disability. VA examination dated December 23, 2022, has diagnosed you with bilateral pes planus."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of pes planus, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's diagnosis of pes planus began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. The evidence reflects that the Veteran's pes planus pre-existed his entry into service and was not aggravated by service.

VA law provides that a Veteran is presumed to be in sound condition, except for defects, infirmities or disorders noted when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, or where clear and unmistakable evidence establishes that an injury or disease existed prior to service and was not aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1132, 1137.

The presumption of soundness attaches only where there has been an induction examination during which the disability about which the Veteran later complains was not detected. See Bagby v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 225, 227 (1991). The regulations provide expressly that the term "noted" denotes "[o]nly such conditions as are recorded in examination reports," 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (b), and that "[h]istory of pre- service existence of conditions recorded at the time of examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions." Id. at (b)(1). For purposes of illustrating the analysis to be used in such cases, the Board notes the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004), issued on June 1, 2004, summarizing the effect of 38 U.S.C. § 1111 on claims for service-connected disability:

When no preexisting condition is noted upon entry into service, the Veteran is presumed to have been sound upon entry. The burden then falls on the government to rebut the presumption of soundness by clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's disability was both preexisting and not aggravated by service. The government may show a lack of aggravation by establishing that there was no increase in disability during service or that any "increase in disability [was] due to the natural progress of the" preexisting condition. 38 U.S.C. § 1153. If this burden is met, then the Veteran is not entitled to service-connected benefits. However, if the government fails to rebut the presumption of soundness under section 1111, the Veteran's claim is one for service connection. This means that no deduction for the degree of disability existing at the time of entrance will be made if a rating is awarded. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.322.

On the other hand, if a preexisting disorder is noted upon entry into service, the Veteran cannot bring a claim for service connection for that disorder, but the Veteran may bring a claim for service-connected aggravation of that disorder. In that case section 1153 applies and the burden falls on the Veteran to establish aggravation. See Jensen v. Brown, 19 F.3d 1413, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 1994). If the presumption of aggravation under section 1153 arises, the burden shifts to the government to show a lack of aggravation by establishing "that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease." 38 U.S.C. § 1153; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.306; Jensen, 19 F.3d at 1417; Wagner, 370 F. 3d at 1096.

Service treatment records include a May 2000 enlistment examination which shows that the Veteran had moderate asymptomatic pes planus upon entering service.  A July 2005 examination report noted moderate asymptomatic pes planus. In a December 2006 Report of Medical History, the Veteran denied foot trouble.  His December 2006 separation examination noted mild pes planus.  

As noted above, the burden is on the Veteran to show that his pre-existing pes planus was aggravated by service. The separation examination, which notes mild pes planus weighs heavily against a finding of aggravation. The Veteran denied foot trouble at the time of separation from service.

A VA examination was conducted in December 2022.  The examiner noted a diagnosis of bilateral flatfoot (pes planus). The Veteran reported that the condition started in 2005 with soreness in the middle of both feet with tightness and a sharp pain. When the condition began, he used Ibuprofen or Aleve as well as insoles in the shoes.  The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's flatfoot/pes planus condition, which clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service, was aggravated beyond its natural progression by military service. The examiner explained that the claims file was reviewed but there are no military medical records supportive of the pes planus condition being problematic or progressive during military service, nor is there any indication of the pes planus having any signs of progressing beyond normal progression to support the claim.

The evidence fails to reflect aggravation of a pre-existing pes planus disability.

The Veteran believes that his pes planus was aggravated by service. On his initial claims application, he asserted that he has flat foot due to the mandatory use of steel toe boots in the Navy and has bilateral flat feet that are painful.  Although the Veteran is competent to state the symptoms of his pes planus, and that he wears inserts, he is not competent to determine that his pre-existing pes planus condition was permanently aggravated as a result of his service. The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of internal pathology. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran because the record does not show that he has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). 

Additionally, the Veteran's report to the VA examiner of onset of painful symptoms in 2005 is not consistent with the service treatment records, specifically the Veteran's denial of foot problems at the time of separation from service in 2006. The service treatment records show the Veteran had a clinical finding of moderate asymptomatic pes planus both upon entering and exiting service which is evidence against aggravation in service. 

Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the December 2022 examiner's opinion because it was offered by a medical professional that is competent to render etiology opinions, is based on review of the file, contains discussions of the facts of the Veteran's case and pertinent medical principles, and includes a rationale that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, (Fed. Cir. 2021). Consequently, the claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for arthritis of the neck

The Veteran contends that he has arthritis of his cervical spine that is related to service.  In his service connection claim, he indicated that his job required heavy lifting and that he was required to wear heavy clothing and equipment such as oxygen breathing apparatus which led to him having arthritis in the neck and associated pain and radiculopathy. 

The December 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable finding: "You have been diagnosed with a disability. Atlanta VAMC imagine report dated August 26, 2019 confirms a diagnosis of early degenerative changes of the lower cervical spine."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The service treatment records do not note any neck or cervical spine complaints or findings.  A July 2005 examination reported noted pseudofolliculitis barbae rash on the chin and neck, but otherwise normal examination of the neck.  The December 2006 separation examination noted normal head, neck, face, and scalp examination.  

A July 2019 VA treatment record noted the Veteran's report of neck pain with numbness down the left arm for the past month; the Veteran noted that he had started working as a forklift operator a few months earlier.

A December 2020 CT of the cervical spine conducted to evaluate cervical radiculopathy noted mild loss of disc height at C5-6 and C6-7.  

A December 2021 cervical spine x-ray noted multilevel mild degenerative disc disease without evidence of fracture or dislocation.  

The Board is cognizant that VA has not obtained an examination or opinion in this case but finds no examination is warranted as there is no credible evidence of an in-service incurrence of a neck/cervical spine condition or injury and no credible evidence of record indicating that the Veteran's current cervical spine degenerative changes may be associated with an in-service injury or event, including for instance a medical opinion or a credible lay report of neck pain symptoms during and since service discharge. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

The Board emphasizes that the Veteran's service treatment records and his post-service treatment records make no reference to a neck injury in service. Rather, neck pain with onset in 2019 is documented.

Moreover, while the Veteran's post-service treatment records indicate the Veteran may have a diagnosis of degenerative joint disease, which is considered a chronic disease under § 3.309(a), it was neither noted during service nor has it been credibly shown to have manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more during service or within a year of discharge from service. Accordingly, presumptive service connection as a chronic disease is not warranted and the application of the continuity of symptomatology framework is not appropriate. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

Based on the foregoing, service connection for neck arthritis is not warranted. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b).

3. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD

The Veteran contends that he has PTSD as a result of in-service stressors.  

The December 2022 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable finding: "A stressor is conceded based on fear. Your military personnel records for the period of June 2000 through December 2006 show that you served in a combat zone."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

Establishing service connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).

A diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a), which simply mandates that, for VA purposes, all mental disorder diagnoses must conform to the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-V). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f).

The service treatment records do not note any psychiatric complaints or findings.  A July 2005 examination report noted normal psychiatric examination.  On the report of medical history completed by the Veteran in December 2006, he denied nervous trouble and depression or excessive worry. 

The post-service medical evidence does not include a diagnosis of PTSD or any other psychiatric condition.  The evidence of record does not reflect that a psychiatrist or psychologist has diagnosed PTSD. 

In September 2022, the Veteran was scheduled for an examination on his claimed PTSD. The AOJ made multiple attempts to contact him that month and was unsuccessful.  The Veteran called later that month to reschedule the examination and indicated he had been out of town. The AOJ thereafter scheduled him for psychiatric examination to be conducted in October 2022; the Veteran failed to report for the examination.

The evidence does not otherwise include any competent and probative evidence or opinions showing that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD.

The Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis of PTSD as such requires specialized medical education and training.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Veteran's October 2022 VA examination was cancelled because he was a "no show."  The Veteran has not asserted that he did not receive proper notice of the examination or requested that an additional examination be scheduled.

The Board finds that the Veteran had proper notice of his scheduled examination and failed to report without good cause. The duty to assist is not always a one-way street. If a veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may have information that is essential. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). The Veteran must cooperate in VA's efforts to obtain evidence needed to adjudicate his claims including attending scheduled VA examinations and promptly communicating with VA why he cannot attend a scheduled VA examination. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c); 3.655(b) (setting forth potential consequences when a veteran fails to appear for a scheduled examination). In this instance, the duty to assist was frustrated by the Veteran's failure to comply with the scheduling request for his VA examination that was needed to produce evidence essential to his claim.

When entitlement or continued entitlement to a benefit cannot be established or confirmed without a current VA examination or re-examination, and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination or re-examination, action shall be taken in accordance with paragraphs (b) or (c) of 38 C.F.R. § 3.655, as appropriate. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant and death of an immediate family member. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (a). When the examination was scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (b).

In keeping with 38 C.F.R. § 3.655, the Board has adjudicated this matter based on the evidence of record. The Board finds that the competent, credible, and probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim. There is no doubt to be resolved and entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, (Fed. Cir. 2021).

4. Entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy, right upper extremity

5. Entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy, left upper extremity

The service treatment records do not note any upper extremity radiculopathy complaints or findings.  A July 2005 examination reported noted normal upper extremities and neurologic examinations.  On the report of medical history completed by the Veteran in December 2006, he denied numbness or tingling.  The December 2006 separation examination noted normal upper extremities and neurologic examinations.  

A July 2019 VA treatment record noted the Veteran's report of neck pain with numbness down the left arm for the past month; the Veteran noted that he had started working as a forklift operator a few months earlier.  A December 2020 CT of the cervical spine conducted to evaluate cervical radiculopathy noted mild loss of disc height at C5-6 and C6-7.  

There is no showing of radiculopathy of either upper extremity during service. Rather, the medical evidence indicates that upper extremity radiculopathy is associated with the Veteran's cervical spine condition. 

As noted above, the Veteran's neck arthritis is not service-connected. As there is no legal basis upon which to award service connection for a disability secondary to a disability that is not service connected, a secondary service connection theory of causation is not possible as a matter of law. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

There is no competent evidence of record to support a finding that the Veteran has a current upper extremity radiculopathy disability that was incurred in or is attributable to his period of service.

The preponderance of the evidence is against the claims of service connection for right and left upper extremity radiculopathy; there is no doubt to be resolved; and service connection is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule For Rating Disabilities, which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

6. Entitlement to a compensable rating for umbilical hernia

The Veteran underwent a right umbilical hernia repair during service in 2004.  A March 2018 rating decision granted service connection for umbilical hernia.  An initial noncompensable rating was assigned from January 9, 2018.  

The Veteran filed his claim for an increased rating in August 2022.  The period on appeal begins one year earlier in August 2021.

The Veteran's service-connected umbilical hernia has been rated by the AOJ under the provisions of Diagnostic Code 7339.  Under the applicable diagnostic criteria, a noncompensable rating is for assignment for wounds, postoperative, healed, with no disability, and belt not indicated. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7339. 

A rating of 20 percent is for assignment where the hernia is small, not well supported by a belt under ordinary conditions, or for a healed ventral hernia or post-operative wounds with weakening of the abdominal wall and indications for a supporting belt. A rating of 40 percent is for assignment where the hernia is large, and not well supported by a belt under ordinary conditions. A 100 percent rating is for assignment for a hernia that is massive, with persistent, severe diastasis of recti muscles or extensive diffuse destruction or weakening of muscular and fascial support of the abdominal wall, so as to be inoperable.

A VA examination was conducted in August 2022.  The Veteran reported residual pain and tenderness to touch in the umbilical area where the hernia was. He had had no recurrence of the hernia.  The examiner noted a history of right umbilical hernia repair in 2004.  On examination, there was no hernia detected.  There was no indication for support.  The Veteran's hernia did not impact his ability to work.  

To warrant a compensable rating, the evidence would need to show a small hernia, not well supported by belt under ordinary conditions, or healed hernia or post-operative wounds with weakening of abdominal wall and indication for a supporting belt. However, such was not shown on the examination of record.

Given that there is no objective evidence of record indicating the need for support with a belt, a compensable rating is not warranted for the Veteran's service-connected umbilical hernia condition.

In sum, the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for the Veteran's umbilical hernia condition.  As such, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. For these reasons, the claim is denied.

7. Entitlement to a compensable rating for right inguinal hernia

The Veteran underwent a right inguinal hernia repair during service in 2004.  A March 2018 rating decision granted service connection for right inguinal hernia.  An initial noncompensable rating was assigned from January 9, 2018.  

The Veteran filed his claim for an increased rating in August 2022.  The period on appeal begins one year earlier in August 2021.

The Veteran's service-connected right inguinal hernia has been rated by the AOJ under the provisions of Diagnostic Code 7338, which provides for a zero percent, non-compensable rating when the hernia was not operated on but remediable or when the hernia is small, reducible or without true hernia protrusion. A 10 percent rating is warranted for a postoperative recurrent hernia readily reducible and well supported by truss or belt and higher ratings if the postoperative recurrent hernia is inoperable, not reducible, or not well supported by truss. A 30 percent rating is warranted if the inguinal hernia is small, post-operative and recurrent, or is unoperated and irremediable, and is either not well supported by a truss or is not readily reducible. A 60 percent rating is warranted for an inguinal hernia which is large, post-operative, and recurrent, not well supported under ordinary conditions and not readily reducible, when considered inoperable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. Diagnostic Code 7338.

A VA examination was conducted in August 2022.  The Veteran reported residual pain and tenderness to touch in the groin area where the hernia was.  He had had no recurrence of the hernia.  The examiner noted a history of right inguinal hernia repair in 2004.  On examination, there was no hernia detected.  There was no indication for support.  The Veteran's hernia did not impact his ability to work.  

For a compensable rating to be warranted for the Veteran's post-operative right inguinal hernia repair, the disability would have to constitute a recurrent hernia readily reducible and well supported by truss or belt. In this case, the VA examiner did not detect an existing hernia. Consequently, there was no indication that a supporting belt was needed. As such, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim; and the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the claim for a compensable rating must be denied.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114. Diagnostic Code 7338.

REASONS FOR REMAND

8. Entitlement to service connection for GERD is remanded.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

An April 2006 service treatment record noted the Veteran reported periodic stomach pain, sometimes very excruciating.

A July 2015 VA treatment record noted GERD.

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was signed into law on August 10, 2022. The PACT Act included changes to medical examination requirements where there is documented toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). The PACT Act requires an individual longitudinal exposure record (ILER) report for all veterans who were subject to toxic exposure risk activities.

In this case, the Veteran contends that his GERD is related to exposure to toxic chemicals while performing his duties during service.  On his August 2022 claim, the Veteran reported he was "exposed to chemicals on the Naval Ship."  His service personnel records noted that is duties included equipment maintenance including work with diesel generators.  

 Although there is evidence of potential exposure to toxic substances during service, a TERA memorandum and ILER report have not been prepared and associated with the claims file. 

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a), the Board is permitted to remand this claim to satisfy a statutory duty and prepare a TERA memorandum and ILER report, as doing so could aid in substantiating the Veteran's claim.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Prepare a TERA memorandum and an ILER report for the Veteran and associate these documents with the claims file.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine whether his GERD is related to service.

The examiner must opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's GERD (1) began during any period of active service; OR (2) is related to an in-service injury or disease, to include the stomach complaints noted in his service treatment records and any toxic exposures in service.

In forming these opinions, the clinician must consider (i) the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments; and (ii) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities.

The examiner should provide rationale for the opinions.
