REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for service-connected lumbosacral strain (formerly diagnosed as lumbar spine intervertebral syndrome) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from February 2015 to November 2018.

This case is being reviewed according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 38 C.F.R. § 19.2. The AMA or modernized review system applies to all claims, requests for reopening of finally adjudicated claims, and requests for revision based on clear and unmistakable error for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019, the effective date of the modernized review system. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400.

The Veteran initiated his claim seeking a rating in excess of 10 percent for a disability of the lumbar spine on February 13, 2021 and a March 2021 rating decision continued the 10 percent evaluation.  In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected lumbosacral strain addressed in a March 2021 rating decision. In May 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim which increased the Veteran's evaluation to 20 percent effective March 8, 2022 based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2022 decision.  In September 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which granted the Veteran's June 2023 request for an extension on the time limit for seeking HLR review citing the COVID-19 global pandemic. The AOJ considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2022 decision and continued the 20 percent evaluation. 

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in October 2023 and elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim seeking a rating in excess of 20 percent for service-connected lumbosacral strain, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Lumbosacral Strain

The Veteran seeks entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for service-connected lumbosacral strain. His disability is afforded a 10 percent rating from November 9, 2018 and a 20 percent rating from March 8, 2022 under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5237 which utilizes the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Formula). 

Under the General Formula, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. 

A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.

A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine and a 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2021 where he reported difficulty bending, pain when rising from a sitting position and pain upon prolonged standing, sitting, and walking. He reported regular use of proscription and topical medications including Robaxin, Zanaflex, Naproxen, Theraworx, and Aspercreme, to alleviate his symptoms. 

The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination in March 2022 where he reported constant pain and intermittent muscle spasms in his lower and mid-back. The Veteran also requires assistance going up stairs and is unable to find a comfortable position when sitting or lying down due to the pain. He reported Epsom salt baths twice per week, taking naproxen, and wearing a lidocaine patch and back brace as needed. 

The Veteran provided an October 2021 private medical opinion which relied on the Veteran's February 2021 lay statement describing symptoms of pain, spasm, an uneven gait, flare-ups, and use of a back brace. The Veteran reported use of Robaxin, Zanaflex, Naproxen, ibuprofen, Cyclobenzaprine, Theraworx, Aspercreme, and salonpas and the October 2021 private evaluator did not indicate if the ameliorative effects of medication were considered in her evaluation. 

Here, neither the March 2021 nor March 2022 VA examiners or the October 2021 private evaluator indicated if the ameliorative effective of the Veteran's reported medications were contemplated by the medical evaluations. 

The Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). In a recent precedential decision in Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the provision of Jones applies when evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities if the relevant Diagnostic Code (DC) does not reference medication use and the Board must discount beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity of each disability. Here, the Veteran's disability is rated under DC 5237 and the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine which does not contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication. 

Therefore, the Board finds the March 2021, March 2022, and October 2021 examinations are inadequate and predecisional duty to assist has occurred. A remand is warranted to afford the Veteran an additional examination where the ameliorative effects of his prescription and topical medications are not considered when evaluating the severity of the Veteran's lumbosacral strain throughout the period on appeal. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (holding that when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Request an opinion from an appropriate examiner to determine the severity of the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral strain throughout the period on appeal (beginning February 2021 to September 2023). The examiner should be provided the claims file for review and is asked to consider the Veteran's February 2021 lay statement describing the severity of his symptoms. 

The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria in the absence of the ameliorative effects of medication.

If it is not possible to provide a retrospective opinion without speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
