ORDER

New and relevant evidence having been submitted, the request to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection for a lumbar herniated disk is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar herniated disk is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

New evidence received in April 2023 is relevant to the issue of entitlement to service connection for a lumbar herniated disk.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudicating the claim for service connection for a lumbar herniated disk have been met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501(a)(1).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Marine Corps on a period of inactive duty training from October 2004 to May 2005 and active duty from May 2007 to May 2008. 

By way of history, the Veteran submitted an original claim for service connection for his back condition in July 2012 that was denied in an August 2013 rating decision. He filed a notice of disagreement in August 2014 which included a new mailing address. The RO issued a Statement of the Case in July 2015 which continued the denial and was mailed to the prior mailing address. The SOC was returned as undeliverable in August 2015. It is unclear whether the RO re-mailed the SOC to the new address. 

A supplemental claim was submitted in April 2023. The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2023. In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision. However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for a lumbar herniated disk, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted sufficient to reopen the previously denied claim for service connection for a lumbar herniated disk.

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). Relevant evidence is evidence that "tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim." 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. The new and relevant standard will not impose a higher evidentiary threshold than the previous new and material evidence standard under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a). Id.

In this matter, the AOJ denied the Veteran's April 2023 supplemental claim because the evidence submitted was not new and relevant. The Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based on the evidence of record at the time of the supplemental claim decision on appeal.

Here, the Board finds new and relevant evidence has been received by way of medical treatment records (July 17, 2009 Saint Vincent MRI of the lumbar spine, and the September 14, 2009 VA report on the MRI scanned into VISTA) which relate to the onset of the claimed back disability. The evidence was not already of record and may prove or disprove the nexus element of the claim for service connection for a lumbar herniated disk.

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar herniated disk is remanded.

Remand by the Board in the AMA is proper for correction of duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors). 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Board finds that a remand is proper.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a lumbar herniated disk. He has maintained that he fell off a truck while carrying a full rucksack and injured his back in January 2008; he did not get any kind of work-up but has been sore ever since. See April 2008 VA treatment record. 

Post-service treatment records include a July 8, 2009 VA CT scan of the lumbar spine which noted an impression of probable right-sided disc protrusion at L5-S1. A July 17, 2009 Saint Vincent MRI of the lumbar spine showed disc desiccation at L4-5 and L5-S1 and board-based disc bulge at L4-5. In March 2011, the Veteran reported to his primary care physician that he was experiencing ongoing low back pain due to an injury to his back in 2007 while in Iraq. He stated he fell off a truck and the pain has been present since 2007 but thinks he may have reinjured it while playing hockey. The Veteran had an MRI performed in 2011 which showed a herniated disk at L5/S1. 

A June 2013 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's diagnosed lumbar herniated disk disorder was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed injury, event, or illness. The examiner explained that there is no evidence of a back injury in service severe enough to cause a chronic back condition. The examiner further stated that multiple medical notes show the Veteran injured his back while playing hockey in 2011, which resulted in a herniated disk. The examiner opined the 2011 injury is the most likely cause for the Veteran's current back problems. 

The Board, however, observes that there was evidence of disc disease prior to the reported 2011 hockey injury. The VA examiner opined that there is no medical evidence to support a causal link between the Veteran's reports of a back injury and his lumbar herniated disk but did not consider the Veteran's private treatment note showing he underwent an MRI in July 2009. Therefore, the Board finds the June 2013 VA opinion is inadequate, which is a pre-decisional duty to assist error that requires a remand for another opinion. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum VA opinion from an examiner addressing the nature and etiology of the Veteran's lumbar herniated disk. The need for an in-person examination is left to the discretion of the examiner proffering the opinion.

In rendering an opinion, the examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran's lumbar herniated disk had onset during active service, or is otherwise related to active service, and explain why or why not.

In rendering an opinion, the examiner should consider the relevant medical evidence of record, to include the April 2008 VAMC treatment note, July 8, 2009 VA CT scan of the lumbar spine, July 17, 2009 Saint Vincent MRI of the lumbar spine, and the Veteran's lay statements asserting that his low back pain is related to an in-service injury. 

A rationale should be provided for all opinions offered.
