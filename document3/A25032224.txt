ORDER

The overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation in the amount of $18,373.24 created by the retroactive termination of payment of additional compensation for three dependent children, is proper; the appeal is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. After affording the Veteran due process, the Veteran's dependency benefits for his children X. and U. were removed from the Veteran's VA compensation award effective July 1, 2014, and Y. was removed effective January 1, 2016.

2. The retroactive removal of the Veteran's children X., U., and S. from his VA compensation award resulted in the creation of a valid debt in the amount of $18,373.24.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The debt of $18,373.24 created by the retroactive removal of three dependent children from the Veteran's VA compensation benefits was proper and is a valid debt.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5111, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.401, 3.501. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Marine Corps from May 2000 to August 2000 and March 2003 to February 2004.

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2023 notification by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Debt Management Center (DMC) that the Veteran owed a debt of $18,373.24.  

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), on which he elected the Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the notification letter on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Additionally, the Board notes that in the VA Form 10182, the Veteran also appealed the issue of the propriety of the reduction of dependency benefits, and this matter will be addressed by the Board in a separate decision.  In that decision, the Board notes that the Board found that the retroactive removal of the Veteran's three children was proper.  

Validity of the Overpayment Debt

In August 2011, the Veteran was granted service-connected disability at the 50 percent level effective May 2010.  Thus, the Veteran was eligible for additional allowance for each dependent.?  See 38 U.S.C. § 1115. 

In September 2011, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, seeking to add his children, X. and U., as dependents to his award of VA disability compensation.  In June 2014, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 21-686c Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, seeking to add his children, X. and U., as dependents to his award of VA disability compensation.  In October 2014, the Regional Office (RO) of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that X. and U. had been added to the Veteran's VA compensation award effective May 2010, the effective date of service connection at the 50 percent rate (as a rating of 30 percent or more is required for dependency benefits).

In December 2015, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 21-686c Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, seeking to add his child, S., as a dependent to his award of VA disability compensation.  In December 2015, the Veteran was notified that his child, S., was added as a dependent to his award effective June 2015, the first day of the month following his birth.

In October 2022, VA sent the Veteran a letter asking that he complete the enclosed VA Form 21-0538 Status of Dependents Questionnaire, within 60 days in order to verify his ongoing eligibility for additional dependency benefits.  Thereafter, there is no indication that the Veteran responded to this request.  In January 2023, because VA had not received the requested dependency information from the Veteran, VA sent the Veteran a letter advising him that his dependent children, X., U., and S., were proposed to be removed from his compensation award. The Veteran was notified that he had 60 days to submit evidence, or the proposed action would be taken. 

In March, 2023 having not received a response from the Veteran, VA notified the Veteran that his dependent children, X., U., and S., were removed from his award effective April 1, 2023, the date that VA last paid the Veteran additional benefits.  The RO removed them as if this date to prevent a higher overpayment from accruing.  It was further noted that if the Veteran did not verify his dependents within the following 90 days, they would be removed effective the first of the month following the date that the Veteran last verified his dependents.  The Veteran was provided with a VA Form 21-686c with which to verify his dependents. 

In August 2023, having not received a response from the Veteran, VA notified the Veteran that his dependent children were removed from his award as of the date that he last verified these dependents.  The RO removed X. was removed from the Veteran's award effective July 1, 2014, U. was removed from the Veteran's award effective July 1, 2014, and S. was removed from the Veteran's award effective January 1, 2016.  These actions resulted in the creation of a debt in the amount of $18,373.24 created by the retroactive termination of payment of additional compensation for three dependent children, as indicated.  The letter delineated for the Veteran the monies he was due as a veteran with no dependents from July 1, 2014, onward.  

As noted, X. and U. were added to the Veteran's VA compensation award effective May 2010, and they were removed as of July 1, 2014.  They were removed as of July 1, 2014 because the dependency form for them was last received in June 2014, so July 1, 2014 was the first day of the next month from when VA knew of their existence as dependents.  S. was added as a dependent to his award effective June 2015.  S. was removed from January 1, 2016.  The Veteran's application to add S. was received in December 2015, so that was the last time VA knew of S.'s existence as a dependent.  The termination date was the first day of the following month, January 1, 2016.  From July 1, 2014, the Veteran was not paid for any dependent children.  He was then paid for S. from June 2015 until January 2016.  After that time, he was not paid for any dependent children.  

In September 2023, the DMC notified the Veteran of the debt of $18,373.24.  As indicated in a separate Board decision, the Veteran's three dependent children, X., U., and S. were properly removed per VA law and regulations.  

VA policy formerly dictated that payment of benefits in an amount exceeding a beneficiary's entitlement that is due to claims-processing delay was not considered administrative error.  See VA Adjudication Manual M21-1, III.v.1.I.3.d.  However, this section of the VA manual was removed.

However, the VA Beneficiary Debt Collection Improvement Act of 2022, 136 Stat. 5462, Pub. Law 117-328 inserted a new statute 38 U.S.C. § 5302B, Prohibition of debt arising from overpayment due to delay in processing.  Under this statute, the following is provided:

(a) Limitation.

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no individual may incur a debt to the United States that-

(A) arises from the participation of the individual in a program or benefit administered by the Under Secretary for Benefits; and

(B) is attributable to the failure of an employee or official of the Department to process information provided by or on behalf of that individual within applicable timeliness standards established by the Secretary.

(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the penal and forfeiture provisions for fiduciaries set forth in chapter 61 of this title [38 U.S.C. § 6101 et seq.].

(b) Notice.

(1) If the Secretary determines that the Secretary has made an overpayment to an individual, the Secretary shall provide notice to the individual of the overpayment.

(2) Notice under paragraph (1) shall include a detailed explanation of the right of the individual-

(A) to dispute the overpayment, including a detailed explanation of the process by which to dispute the overpayment; or

(B) to request a waiver of indebtedness.

(c) Delay on collection.

(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may not take any action under section 3711 of title 31 [31 U.S.C.S. § 3711] regarding an overpayment described in a notice under subsection (b) of this section until the date that is 90 days after the date the Secretary issues such notice.

(2) The Secretary may take action under section 3711 of title 31 [31 U.S.C.S § 3711] regarding an overpayment described in a notice under subsection (b) of this section before the date that is 90 days after the date the Secretary issues such notice if the Secretary determines that delaying such action is-

(A) likely to make repayment of such overpayment more difficult for an individual;

(B) likely to cause an unpaid debt to be referred to the Treasury Offset Program; or

(C) not in the best interest of the individual."

In sum, 38 U.S.C. § 5302B(a) bans the collection/creation of debts against Veterans that result from the failure to process information within applicable timeliness standards established by the Secretary.  In other words, it basically bans the creation or collection of debts created due to excessive administrative delay or processing errors.

In December 2023, VA's Assistant Deputy Under Secretary, Office of Policy and Oversight (VBA) issued a Memorandum entitled "Temporary Timeliness Instruction, providing guidelines for implementing the statute pending formal rulemaking.  The memorandum provides that absent delays directly attributable to a beneficiary's actions, VA must issue a Decision Notification Letter based on information provided by or on behalf of a beneficiary within one year from the date of claim.  When VA fails to do so, VA will not create additional debt for overpayments made more than 1 year from the date of claim.  The memorandum provides that its instructions apply to all debt collection activities pending and nonfinal on June 27, 2023.

In this case, the Veteran did not reply to VA's request for dependency verification.  Within one year, the RO adjusted his dependency benefits in August 2023.  Thus, the Board finds that the new statute does not apply in this case.  The creation of the debt in this case was proper and represents a valid debt.   The appeal is accordingly denied.
