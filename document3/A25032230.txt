ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) secondary to a service-connected thyroid condition, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The persuasive weight of the evidence weighs in favor of a finding that the Veteran's OSA is secondary to his service-connected thyroid condition. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA secondary to a service-connected thyroid condition have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1967 to February 1971. He was honorably discharged from service. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied service connection for OSA. In March 2025, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) requesting the direct review docket with review by a Veterans Law Judge.  Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The denial of due process may include issuing a Board decision prior to the expiration of the one-year period for a claimant to request a docket change. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, the Veteran, through his attorney, specifically waived the remaining time to request a docket change. Accordingly, the Board is issuing this decision prior to August 2025, which is the expiration of the one-year time period to request a docket change. 

The Board notes that it is required to seek clarification when a Veteran elected the direct review docket but attached evidence to the NOD. Edwards v. McDonough, 32 Vet. App. 56 (2023). However, in this instance, as the Board is able to grant the Veteran's claim without the benefit of the February 2025 Dr. C.V. independent OSA nexus opinion, the Veteran is not prejudiced by the Board not considering this evidence when rendering this decision. Additionally, there is other information attached to the NOD which is information noted elsewhere in the record. Thus, rather than evidence, the Board interprets this other information as argument whose purpose is to re-emphasize the circumstances to which the Veteran believes entitle him to service connection for OSA. 

 This appeal has been advanced on the docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c). 

Entitlement to service connection for OSA secondary to a service-connected conditions thyroid condition is granted.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of an established service-connected disease. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.310 (a)-(b); 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Allen v, Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).  Additionally, when aggravation of a veteran's non-service-connected condition is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected condition, such veteran shall be compensated for the degree of disability (but only that degree) over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. When service connection is established for a secondary condition, the secondary condition shall be considered part of the original condition. Id.  

A medical nexus opinion must state whether the claimed condition was caused by or aggravated by the service-connected condition. El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136 (2013); 38 U.S.C. § 1110. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (holding all that is needed is a "but for" causation or aggravation to show secondary service connection, which is an incremental-increase in the severity of a nonservice-connected disease and contemplates multi-causal links, including action and inaction.).

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability that are subject to lay observation. 38 U.S.C. § 1153 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support presence of disability even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence).

Depending on the evidence and the contentions of record in a particular case, lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis and medical etiology of a condition. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Specifically, lay evidence may be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis where (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.  

Additionally, where symptoms are capable of lay observation, a lay witness is competent to testify to a lack of symptoms prior to service, continuity of symptoms after in-service injury or disease, and receipt of medical treatment for such symptoms. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002). Lay testimony is not competent to determine the extent or etiology of  matters which require medical testing and expertise to determine. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).

The claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a).  The VA shall consider all information, including lay and medical evidence of record.  VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claims of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) 

The Board will consider if the criteria for service connection have been met.

The first element of service connection is a current disability.  The August 2024 rating decision conceded the current disability of OSA.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Thus, the Board finds the first element of service connection is satisfied.  

The second element of service connection on a secondary basis is that the Veteran have a service-connected disability which the Veteran asserts is proximately due to or the result of an established service-connected disease. In this case, the Veteran is service connected for thyroid, heart and diabetic conditions. Accordingly, the Board finds the second element of service connection on a secondary basis is satisfied. 

The third element of service connection on a secondary basis is a nexus between the current OSA disability and the service-connected conditions. For the purposes of evaluating the Veteran's service connection for OSA on a secondary basis, the Board notes that the Veteran is currently service connected for coronary artery disease (CAD) with hypertensive heart disease and aortic/mitral regurgitation associated with diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) (30 percent rating), DMII (20 percent rating), atrial fibrillation associated with CAD with hypertensive heart disease (10 percent rating), hypertension associated with DMII (0 percent rating), and malignant neoplasms of the thyroid, hypothyroidism, status post thyroidectomy (0 percent rating).

The March 2021 VA diabetes examiner noted that the date of onset of DMII was unknown. The examiner noted that Veteran's hypertension was associated with his DMII condition. The examination report noted that the Veteran's records reflected one medication was prescribed to control his hypertension in 2006. It was unclear whether the year 2006 was when the hypertension was first diagnosed or whether 2006 was the year the Veteran first began taking medication for hypertension. See also, December 2021, March 2022, and February 2023 hypertension examination report. The examiner further noted that the Veteran's hypertension was aggravated by his diabetic condition which in turn was at least as likely to contribute to the development of his hypertensive heart disease.

An April 2021 private treatment record noted that the Veteran had his tonsils out in 1955.  A December 2021 Veteran statement in support of his claim noted that he returned home from Vietnam in 1971. He was diagnosed with OSA in the early 2000's. To improve his breathing, his nose was broken and then straightened, tissue was removed from his throat and his uvula was removed. The Veteran further stated that he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in the 1980s or 1990s and both his thyroid glands were removed. An April 2021 private treatment record also noted the Veteran had surgery for sleep apnea in 2001, had hypertension, hypothyroidism, DMII, hypertensive heart disease with heart failure.

The May 2023 VA thyroid examiner noted that the Veteran's medical records reflected he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 1985. He underwent a thyroidectomy and now has hypothyroidism. In a narrative portion of the May 2023 examination report, the examiner noted sleep apnea was one of several conditions resulting from the Veteran's thyroid condition. The examination form also contained a list of potential findings, signs and symptoms of the thyroid.  Respiratory symptoms and cardiac symptoms were included on the list. Although the examiner did not check the box for respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms on the form, sleep apnea was specifically noted earlier in the examination report as one of the Veteran's thyroid symptoms. Additionally, at the very least, inclusion of respiratory symptoms as a sign and symptom of a thyroid condition on the preprinted medical examination form reflects that respiratory and cardiovascular conditions may be attributable to a thyroid condition.  

The May 2024 VA OSA nexus examination report noted the Veteran had been diagnosed with severe OSA in 2018.  This examiner did not address the Veteran's 2001 OSA surgery. The May 2024 VA nexus opinion stated that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's OSA was proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected condition of DMII and hypertension. (The thyroid was not included in this part of the nexus opinion). The examiner stated that with a body mass index of 30.8 in 2018, the Veteran was obese. The examiner noted that OSA is most common in people who are overweight or obese because excess weight created fat deposits in the person's neck called pharyngeal fat. The fat could block the upper airway during sleep. Additionally, increased abdominal girth from excess fat compresses the chest wall, decreasing lung volume.  This reduced lung capacity diminishes airflow making the upper airway more likely to collapse during sleep. OSA risk continued to rise with increasing body mass index. 

The examiner also did not consider whether the Veteran's service-connected thyroid condition may have caused his weight gain. Nor did this examiner address the Veteran's weight before and after 2000 to determine if the Veteran gained weight before or after he was diagnosed with OSA. The Veteran's separation physical in 1971 reflected he was six feet three inches and weighed 180 pounds. A December 2023 private record reflected the Veteran's height was six feet two inches and his weight was 235 with clothes (BMI 30.2). An August 2024 private treatment record reflected a weight of 234 pounds with clothes and a BMI of 30.1.  Although, the record does not contain treatment records for the time period after the Veteran separated from service until his OSA diagnosis in 2000, the Board notes that the examiner did not report any information obtained from the Veteran relating to his weight gain trends after service. It is not reasonable to conclude that the Veteran's weight in in 2018 or after, caused his OSA in 2000 without understanding the Veteran's weight gain trends prior to and after his OSA diagnosis.  

The May 2024 VA nexus examiner noted that less common causes of sleep apnea included enlarged tonsils that block the airway, anatomical features such as a large neck or narrow throat, endocrine disorders, including DM and thyroid disease, acid reflux, lung diseases and heart problems. The examiner further noted that roughly 60 to 90% of adults with OSA are overweight. The examiner did not note that the Veteran had his tonsils removed when he was a child or address the removal of his uvula and additional tissues which would have decreased the airway blockage the examiner mentions. The examiner also did not opine on why the Veteran did not have a less common cause of sleep apnea when the Veteran had three of the five less common causes of OSA. The Veteran had thyroid cancer in 1985, approximately 15 years prior to his first OSA diagnosis in 2000.  As mentioned above, the May 2023 thyroid examiner noted that the Veteran's OSA was a symptom of his thyroid condition. The Veteran is also service connected for DMII and three heart related conditions (hypertension, atrial fibrillation and CAD).

The Veteran had his tonsils removed as a child and his uvula and additional tissue were removed in 2001 without improvement to his OSA. The removal of his anatomy that potentially may block airway passages, indicates that the Veteran's OSA may not have been impacted by his anatomical features but instead affected by his thyroid, heart, and DMII conditions which were all noted as possible OSA causes by the May 2024 VA examiner. 

The VA examiner concluded that because 60 to 90 percent of OSA patients are overweight, the Veteran's OSA was caused by his weight. This conclusion assumes that if a patient is overweight, the OSA was caused by weight gain without considering that weight is one risk factor and that a patient may have multiple risk factors. Moreover, this conclusion did not consider that the Veteran had three of the five conditions which the examiner stated could cause OSA. 

Giving the Veteran the benefit of all reasonable doubt, the Board finds that at a minimum, there is a nexus between the Veteran's current OSA and service-connected thyroid condition.  Notably, and as noted above, in the May 2023 VA thyroid examination sleep apnea was specifically listed as one of the Veteran's thyroid symptoms.  As the third element of service connection is satisfied, there is no need for the Board to discuss whether the Veteran's heart conditions and DMII aggravated his OSA.  

Accordingly, as all three elements of service connection on a secondary basis have been met, the Board finds the Veteran's OSA is service-connected secondary to his service-connected thyroid condition. 

In reaching this determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. The persuasive weight of the evidence weighs in favor of a finding that the Veteran's OSA is related to his active-duty service. As such, that doctrine is applicable in the instant appeal, and his claim must be granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, supra.
