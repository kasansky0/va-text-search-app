ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 22, 2021 for the assignment of a 20 percent disability rating for service-connected right shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis and bursitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

While the matter of entitlement to an increased disability rating for service-connected right shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis and bursitis has been pending on appeal since August 2008, entitlement to an increased disability rating did not arise until at least March 22, 2021. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 22, 2021 for the assignment of a 20 percent disability rating for service-connected right shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis and bursitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. 

§§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400, 4.3. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from July 1984 until his honorable discharge in December 1993. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

As an initial matter, on August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). This law, which went into effect in February 2019, creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. 

Following the August 2021 rating decision assigning a 20 percent disability rating for a service-connected right shoulder condition, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request, seeking higher level review. The AOJ issued a rating decision thereafter in September 2023, denying the Veteran's claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date. He timely appealed to the Board and sought direct review by a Veterans' Law Judge (VLJ). The Board is honoring his choice and, accordingly, this decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

Important for this decision, the Board's review of the record under the AMA is limited by statute and regulation. Under the direct review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2021 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Dates

The statutory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110. Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

In cases involving direct service connection, the effective date will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). 

The reference above to "the date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation. The Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (the Court) has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought; this is determined on a "facts found" basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These "facts found" include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that VA receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35. 

"Claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998); Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199 (1992). The Board notes that, effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its adjudication regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary (i.e., VA Form 21-526). 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). This rulemaking also eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims for increase and revised 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). These amendments, however, are only applicable with respect to claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686 (Sept. 25, 2014). 

Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form must be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If the application form is received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. In evaluating a claim, the Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the evaluation of shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis and bursitis 

By way of procedural history, the Veteran filed his initial claim for entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder condition in January 1994. Service connection was granted in a July 1994 rating decision; the AOJ assigned a 10 percent disability rating based on painful motion. The AOJ acknowledged the Veteran's recurrent right shoulder pain in service and an examination that revealed positive impingement sign, evidence of tendinitis, and a probable rotator cuff injury. The findings of a VA examination performed in connection with the claim revealed subacromial bursitis, slight limitation of motion, and positive swelling below the acromioclavicular joint. The AOJ continued the assigned 10 percent disability rating for residuals of right shoulder strain and impingement with subacromial bursitis in an April 1996 rating decision. The July 1994 and April 1996 rating decisions subsequently became final. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(b); 7252.

Thereafter, the Veteran filed a claim for entitlement to an increased disability rating for his service-connected right shoulder condition in August 2008. In connection with his claim, VA treatment records were associated with the file, including a physician's note also dated August 2008. The note included, in pertinent part, as follows:

"The pain [in the Veteran's right shoulder] has been off and on for the past 20 years. For the past 10 years, it has been about 2-3/10 pain, increased with abduction. The past several months, there has been a tight feeling and increased pain in the shoulder. A heaviness which seems to extend into the posterior forearm..."

The assessment that day revealed full abduction with slight pain. Anterior flexion was slightly limited by pain and rotation was also slightly limited. The only area of tenderness was at the far anterior aspect of the rotator cuff. Otherwise, there were no specific areas of tenderness, no pain with resisted abduction, and no pain with resisted adduction. An x-ray of the shoulder was ordered. The Veteran also received a VA examination in connection with his claim for increase, which he received in November 2008. A January 2009 rating decision continued the Veteran's 10 percent disability rating for right shoulder bursitis based on the limitation of range of motion displayed during the November 2008 VA examination. The Veteran did not submit a notice of disagreement or new and material evidence within one year of notice of the rating decision. This decision was therefore deemed to be final. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (b); 7252.

In August 2021, the Veteran filed another claim for entitlement to an increased disability rating for his service-connected right shoulder condition. In an October 2021 rating decision, the AOJ increased the Veteran's disability rating for this condition from 10 percent to 20 percent based on further limitation of motion. The AOJ also noted additional diagnoses for the Veteran's right shoulder. The AOJ assigned an effective date of March 22, 2021 - the date the Veteran filed an Intent to File - for the date of increase. 

He contends, however, that he should receive an earlier effective date. During a higher-level review informal conference, his representative argued that there was new and material evidence, specifically an MRI dated January 30, 2009, that was received within one year of the January 2009 rating decision that should have been considered a claim for increase and that would have still been pending at the time of the October 2021 decision, invoking 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). The increase, therefore, should have gone back to the date of the claim relevant to the January 2009 rating decision or the date the new evidence was received. 

As an initial matter, 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(b), which was ultimately eliminated in March 2015, stated that once a formal claim for pension or compensation has been allowed or a formal claim for compensation disallowed for the reason that the service-connected disability is not compensable in degree, receipt of (1) a report of examination or hospitalization by VA or uniformed services, (2) evidence from a private physician or layman, or (3) reports and records from State and other institutions will be accepted as an informal claim for increased benefits or an informal claim to reopen.

The Court has held that this regulation only applies to a particular group of claims. See Pacheco v. Gibson, 27 Vet. App. 21 (2014) (en banc) (construing ambiguity contained in § 3.157 as applying to a previous disallowance for a service-connected disability not being compensable in degree); see Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 249 (2002) (finding that § 3.157 applies to a defined group of claims, i.e., as to disability compensation, those claims for which a report of a medical examination or hospitalization is accepted as an informal claim for an increase of a service-connected rating where service connection has already been established). Specifically, VA medical records are not accepted as informal claims for disabilities where service connection has not been established, since the mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for a condition. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998); see also Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999). In the case at hand, the Veteran has been service-connected for a right shoulder condition since December 1993. 

In a brief dated January 2025, the Veteran's representative argues that following the January 2009 rating decision, post-decisional VA medical records in the form of the right shoulder MRI were constructively before VA, which would constitute an informal claim for increase. As such, she argues, this rating decision did not become final. She cites to Turner v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 207 (2018) in support of this contention, which addressed constructive receipt of VA treatment records under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b):

"The Court held that if new and material evidence, such as VA treatment records, is 'received' during the one-year appeal period following a regional office decision, the VA is required to consider that evidence as having been submitted with the original claim. The Court further stated that VA treatment records can be 'constructively' received if VA adjudicators have sufficient knowledge of their existence within the one-year appeal period, even if they are unaware of the contents. Until the VA reconsiders the claim with the newly received or constructively received evidence, the denied claim remains pending." 

She then stipulates that Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2020) overruled Turner's requirement that VA adjudicators must have knowledge of the existence of VA medical records for them to be considered constructively received. 

Here, records were generated by VA within the one-year appeal period following the rating decision. Battle Creek VA Medical Center (VAMC) medical records dated February 5, 2009 included an MRI report for the Veteran's right shoulder that was completed on January 30, 2009.

As such, VA was in constructive possession of these treatment records, and VA had an obligation to consider the evidence received after its January 2009 rating decision as having been filed in connection with his August 2008 claim for increase. VA did not make a determination as to whether the VAMC treatment records were new and material; therefore, the Veteran's claim did not become final and remained pending. See Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1407 (Fed. Cir. 2014); see also Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1354-55 (Fed. Cir. 2020). 

The Board finds that due to the VAMC treatment records that were received within a year of the Veteran's January 2009 rating decision, the Veteran's claim remained pending prior to the October 2021 rating decision that was appealed to the Board. See Beraud, 766 F.3d at 1407; see also Lang, 971 F.3d at 1354-55.

However, as noted above, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. While the Board acknowledges that the claim has been pending since August 2008, entitlement to a 20 percent disability rating did not arise until after this date. 

The Veteran's right shoulder is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DCs) 5003-5201. At the time of the January 2009 rating decision, his condition was evaluated under DC 5019 for bursitis, which advised adjudicators to rate based on limitation of motion under the appropriate DCs for the specific joint involved - here, DC 5201. As an initial matter, the Board notes that during the pendency of the appeal, VA revised the portion of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities that addresses the musculoskeletal system. Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76463 (Nov. 30, 2020) (codified at 38C.F.R. § 4.71a). The final rule went into effect February 7, 2021.

When regulations are revised during the course of an appeal, the Board is generally required to consider the claim in light of both the former and revised schedular criteria and to apply the regulation more favorable to the Veteran. The new rating criteria, however, may be applied only prospectively from the effective date of the change forward, unless the regulatory change specifically permits retroactive application. VAOPGCPREC 3-2000 (Apr. 10, 2000); Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (emphasis added). The final rule did not specifically permit retroactivity of the changes. The Board has an independent obligation to consider all potentially applicable provisions of law and regulation and to apply the diagnostic criteria in a manner that maximizes benefits. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008). Thus, the Board will consider all applicable criteria in evaluating the Veteran's claim.

Under both sets of regulations, normal range of motion in the shoulder is from zero to 180 degrees of forward elevation (flexion) and zero to 180 degrees of shoulder abduction. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate I. As the evidence reflects that the Veteran is right hand dominant, the ratings pertaining to the major extremity are applicable in the instant case. Prior to February 7, 2021, under DC 5201, limitation of arm motion that is limited to shoulder level warrants a 20 percent rating in the major and minor extremities. Such limitation that is limited midway between the side and shoulder level warrants a 30 percent rating in the major extremity. Such limitation to 25 degrees from the side warrants a 40 percent rating in the minor extremity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

The February 7, 2021, amendments to DC 5201 did not intend to alter the rating criteria; rather, they simply clarified the specific ranges of motion that qualified as limitations to promote consistency among ratings. As noted in the clarification, a 20 percent rating for a major or minor joint where motion is limited "at shoulder level," was clarified as being flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees or less. A 30 percent rating for a major joint, or 20 percent for a minor joint, where motion is limited to "midway between side and shoulder level," was clarified as being flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees or less. Finally, a 40 percent rating for a major joint, or 30 percent for a minor joint, where motion is limited "to 25 degrees from side" was clarified as being flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from side.

In the instant case, available medical evidence does not quantify the limitation of the Veteran's range of motion for his right shoulder. Following the Veteran's MRI in January 2009, he received physical therapy for his shoulder. In October 2009, he had "fairly good" range of motion. However, by September 2012, his physician noted definite limitation of rotation compared to the left shoulder, but that he had full abduction. The Board observes that a plethora of private treatment records were associated with the record following the October 2021 rating decision; however, as they are outside the evidentiary window, the Board is unable to consider the evidence contained within. 

As such, the Board finds that while the matter has been pending since August 2008, entitlement to a 20 percent disability rating did not arise until later. On these facts, because the earliest effective date legally possible has been assigned, and no effective date for the award of a 20 percent disability rating for service-connected right shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis and bursitis earlier than March 22, 2021 is warranted, the appeal for an earlier effective date is without legal merit and must be denied. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
