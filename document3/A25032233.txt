ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability evaluation in excess of 30 percent for service-connected asthma is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability evaluation for service-connected right-shoulder surgical scars is denied. 

Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation in excess of 20 percent for service-connected status post right-shoulder surgery/labral tear is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected asthma did not manifest as FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted or less, FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent or less, at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least 3 times per year) course of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids; nor did the Veteran experience more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or require daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immuno-suppressive medications.

2. The evidence of record shows the Veteran's three service-connected right-shoulder scars do not more nearly approximate scars which are unstable or painful or deep and nonlinear with an area of at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm.) but less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.) or with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  

3. The evidence of record shows service-connected status post right-shoulder surgery/labral tear, as the dominant upper extremity, more nearly approximates arm limitation of motion at shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a disability evaluation in excess of 30 percent for service-connected asthma have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6602.

2. The criteria for an initial compensable disability evaluation for service-connected right-shoulder surgical scars have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, 7804, 7805.

3. The criteria for a disability evaluation in excess of 20 percent for service-connected status post right-shoulder surgery/labral tear have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.14, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5003, 5010, 5200, 5201, 5202, 5204, 5205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 2008 to November 2012.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 decision, issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO), which is also the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran filed a timely appeal to the Board under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA) with the submission of an April 2024 Decision Review Request (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) (VA Form 10182), disagreeing with the March 2024 decision on appeal. The Veteran specified the claims of higher evaluations for asthma, right-shoulder scars and status post right-shoulder surgery/labral tear. The Veteran requested the Direct Review docket, whereby the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. No evidence accompanied the NOD submission. 

Therefore, if evidence was associated with the claims file after the closing of the period for review of evidence in the Direct Review docket, the Board has not considered it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence which was added to the claims file which the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

The procedural history for the three issues on appeal shows that while the Veteran was on active duty in the military, a June 2012 Physical Evaluation Board made findings that the Veteran was not physically fit for further service based on his asthma and right-shoulder conditions. A decision followed later in June 2012 which proposed service connection for the conditions, with asthma rated at 30 percent disabling and right-shoulder at 10 percent disabling. A December 2012 decision granted service connection at the proposed ratings, each effective November 30, 2012. The Veteran did not appeal the decision.

In October 2020, the Veteran filed a claim for a higher initial rating for service-connected asthma, which a November 2021 decision denied. The Veteran filed a claim in May 2022 for a higher initial rating for status post right-shoulder surgery/labral tear. That claim was denied in an August 2022 decision, based on the Veteran's failure to report to a VA examination.

VA received the Veteran's new claim for higher ratings one year and seven days later on September 5, 2023, the date on which the period on appeal for these claims began. After examinations for the three issues were conducted in February 2024, the March 2024 decision on appeal granted service connection for right-shoulder scars at a noncompensable rating, effective September 5, 2023 and a 20-percent rating for service-connected status post right shoulder surgery/labral tear, also effective September 5, 2023. The decision denied a higher initial rating in excess of 30 percent for service-connected asthma. As stated, the Veteran appealed the decision on the three claims in April 2024. 

Schedular Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (rating schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  When a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Additionally, it is possible for a veteran to be awarded separate percentage evaluations for separate periods (staged ratings), based on the facts. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Where an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of the veteran's disability is the primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  

However, for claims other than those appealing the initial rating assigned, attention in adjudicating an increased rating claim will be directed to evidence concerning the state of the disability from the period of one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as "pyramiding," must be avoided; however, separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury, so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities, VA, in addition to applying the schedular criteria, may assign a higher disability rating when the evidence demonstrates functional loss due to limited or excessive movement, pain, weakness, excessive fatigability, or incoordination, to include during flare-ups and with repeated use, if those factors are not considered in the rating criteria.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; see also DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 204-07 (1995); Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011). Nonetheless, a disability rating higher than the minimum compensable rating is not assignable under any diagnostic code relating to range of motion where pain does not cause a compensable functional loss. Rather, the "pain must affect some aspect of 'the normal working movements of the body' such as 'excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance,'" as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 4.40, before a higher rating may be assigned. See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 37 (2011) (noting that while "pain may cause a functional loss, pain itself does not constitute a functional loss," and, is therefore, not grounds for entitlement to a higher disability rating).

Additionally, the intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability. Thus, with or without degenerative arthritis, actually painful, unstable or malaligned joints, due to a healed injury, are recognized as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59; see also Burton v. Shinseki at 5 (holding that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 are not limited to disabilities involving arthritis).

Further considerations required of VA when evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities are to ensure findings on examination include range of motion measurements made during active and passive motion and in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing maneuvers. Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158, 168 (2016).  Additionally, findings must account for the effects of pain, weakness, fatigability, or incoordination on range of motion during flare-ups and in repeated use over time.  When flare-ups are not occurring during the examination or repeated use over time is not tested that day, findings nonetheless must include estimations of additional loss of motion made in actual degrees, based on a veteran's reports or as demonstrated by the veteran. Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 34-36 (2017).

In adjudicating these claims, the Board must assess the competence and credibility of the Veteran and probative value of the evidence of record in its whole. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005), 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2) (2021) (Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of the facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person). In determining whether documents submitted by a veteran are credible, the Board may consider internal consistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995). 

1. Entitlement to an initial disability evaluation in excess of 30 percent for service-connected asthma.

The Veteran contends that the current disability evaluation for his condition does not reflect the level of its severity. 

The March 2024 decision on appeal did not identify any favorable findings of fact.

The Veteran's asthma disability is rated 30 percent under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602. Under DC 6602, a 30 percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or; daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy, or; inhalational anti-inflammatory medication. 

A rating of 60 percent is warranted with FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or; at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or; intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids. 

A rating of 100 percent is warranted with FEV-1 less than 40 percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or; more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or; requirement of daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immuno-suppressive medications. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602.

DC 6602 has a note that states in the absence of clinical findings of asthma at the time of the examination, a verified history of asthmatic attacks must be of record.

Turning to the record, the Veteran was afforded one VA examination in the appeal period for respiratory conditions in February 2024. The examiner diagnosed asthma. The Veteran's PFT results showed FEV-1/FVC of 69 percent pre-bronchodilator and 83 percent post-bronchodilator (neither designated as "predicted"). The examiner further found FEV-1 of 69 percent pre-bronchodilator predicted and 90 percent predicted post-bronchodilator. The examiner noted that the FEV-1 % predicted test result most accurately reflects the Veteran's level of disability. 

The Veteran reported increased asthma symptoms in cold weather. He also reported the use of an albuterol inhaler "as needed" and also being "2-3 times a week." The examiner noted this in the examination report as "intermittent" use of inhalational bronchodilator therapy for treatment. The Veteran did not require the use of corticosteroid medicals, oral bronchodilators, antibiotics, or outpatient oxygen therapy. He reported that he had had no asthma attacks with episodes of respiratory failure in the past 12 months. The Veteran reported that he had made no visits to a physician in the past 12 months for required care for exacerbations. The examiner found no other pulmonary conditions, pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to the Veteran's asthma. The examiner noted that no exercise capacity has been performed.

Based on the foregoing findings, the criteria for the next higher rating of 60 percent have not been satisfied. For example, the examiner stated the FEV-1 % predicted test result most accurately reflects the Veteran's level of disability. A 60-percent rating requires 40 to 55 percent predicted. The FEV-1 % test result for post-bronchodilator was 90 percent predicted. Moreover, in the alternative, a 60-percent rating would require at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations. The Veteran reported none in the past 12 months. A further alternative requires intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids. The Veteran reported and the record in the appeal period shows no such use. 

A 100 percent rating requires an even lower FEV-1 % test result, as well as the alternative of more intensive corticosteroid use. The rating schedule offers the further alternative of more than one asthma attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure. The Veteran reported no asthma attacks with episodes of respiratory failure in the past 12 months. 

Lastly, the Board briefly notes that, as stated, the Veteran reported use for treatment of an albuterol inhaler, as needed. As set forth above, DC 6602 makes reference to inhaled medications in the criteria for a 30-percent rating. Therefore, the effects of such medications have been factored into the rating criteria and their ameliorative effects are not for consideration in the higher ratings. Further analysis of their ameliorative effects in the higher ratings therefore is not necessary. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 61 (2012).

The Board's review of the record in the appeal period shows no medical or lay evidence to support a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's asthma. As the Board does not find at least an approximate balance of the evidence in favor of the claim, it is denied.

The Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. However, as the evidence is decidedly and persuasively against the claim, the rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 780-81 (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability evaluation for service-connected right-shoulder surgical scars.

The Veteran contends that the severity of his condition warrants a compensable disability rating indicating at least some measurable level of severity. 

The decision on appeal did not identify any favorable findings of fact.

The Veteran's three right-shoulder scars currently are evaluated at a noncompensable rating (0 percent) under DC 7804. Evaluation of scars is governed by several DCs. Although VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018, DCs 7804 and 7805 remain unchanged by the amendments. Since 2018, 38 C.F.R. §4.118 (b) notes that two or more skin conditions may be combined in accordance with § 4.25 only if separate areas of the skin are involved. If two or more skin conditions all involve the same area of skin, only the highest evaluation should be used.

DC 7804 provides a 10 percent rating for one or two scars that are unstable or painful, a 20 percent rating for three or four scars that are unstable or painful, and a 30 percent rating for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. Note (1) to the code further provides that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. Note (2) adds that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, the rater should add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. Note (3) provides that scars evaluated under Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under Code 7804, when applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.

As stated, an evaluation may be received under DCs 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805, as the codes are considered analogous or closely related. Diagnostic Code 7800 addresses scars of the head, face or neck, due to burns or other causes; or other disfigurement of the head, face or neck. The code provides that one characteristic of disfigurement warrants a 10 percent rating. A scar with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with two or three characteristics of disfigurement warrants a 30 percent rating. A scar with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with four or five characteristics of disfigurement warrants a 50 percent rating. A scar with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion of three or more features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with six or more characteristics of disfigurement warrants an 80 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Note (1) to DC 7800 presents the following list of "8 characteristics of disfigurement" for purposes of evaluation under § 4.118: A scar 5 or more inches in length; a scar at least one-quarter inch wide at widest part; surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation; scar adherent to underlying tissue; skin hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches; skin texture abnormal in an area exceeding six square inches; underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding six square inches; and, skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches. Id.

Diagnostic Code 7801 pertains to burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are deep and nonlinear. Under these criteria, a scar with an area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm.) but less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.) warrants a 10 percent rating. Higher ratings are warranted for a scar with a larger area. Prior to August 13, 2018, Note (1) to DC 7801 instructed that a deep scar is one associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Since August 13, 2018, DC 7801 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. DC 7801 was otherwise unchanged by the August 13, 2018 amendments.

DC 7802 provides for burn scars or scars due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. It assigns a 10 percent rating for scars with area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. Note (1) to the code states: For the purposes of DCs 7801 and 7802, the six (6) zones of the body are defined as each extremity, anterior trunk, and posterior trunk. The midaxillary line divides the anterior trunk from the posterior trunk. Note (2) states: A separate evaluation may be assigned for each affected zone of the body. Combine the separate evaluations under §4.25. Alternatively, if a higher evaluation would result from adding the areas affected from multiple zones of the body, a single evaluation may also be assigned under this diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802.

DC 7804 provides a 10 percent rating for one or two scars that are unstable or painful, a 20 percent rating for three or four scars that are unstable or painful, and a 30 percent rating for five or more scars that are unstable of painful. Note (1) provides that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. Note (2) provides that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. Note (3) provides that scars evaluated under Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under Code 7804, when applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.

Lastly, under DC 7805, disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under DCs 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804 are to be rated under an appropriate diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7805.

The Veteran was afforded a February 2024 VA examination for scars/disfigurement. The examiner diagnosed "scar [sic]," status post right shoulder surgery. The Veteran reported the onset of his condition was in September 2010, the scars had stayed the same and he experiences no current symptoms. He also reported he had not undergone any surgery, he had no current treatment and he did not use any medications. However, it is clear that this was a typographical error regarding the surgery, as the examiner noted the prior surgery and the Board found he did have shoulder surgery, as explained in rating the shoulder below.

The examiner noted at the outset that the Veteran does not have scars or disfigurement of the head, face or neck. She also found the Veteran's scars, which are of the trunk or extremities, are not painful. Moreover, his scars are not unstable, with frequent loss of covering of the skin over the scar. The examiner found the scars are not due to burns. 

Therefore, based on these findings, DC 7800 is not applicable for rating purposes, as the Veteran's scars are not of the head, face or neck. DC 7804 addresses scars which are unstable or painful. As the examiner found neither,  DC 7804 therefore is not applicable.

Further findings on examination include that the Veteran's three scars are located on the right-upper extremity on the anterior shoulder, posterior shoulder and superior shoulder. The sizes of the scars are as follows: Scar #1: 1.4 x 0.15 cm; Scar # 2: 2.1 x 0.2 cm; and Scar # 3: 1.5 x 0.1 cm. The examiner also found the approximate total area of these scars is 0.78 sq. (squared) cm. These measurements are considerably less than the minimum required 39 sq. cm. in DC 7801 and the barest fraction of the 929 sq. cm. required under the Veteran's assigned DC 7802. 

Other findings include there was no underlying soft-tissue damage, the scars do not cause limitation of function/motion and have no functional-loss impact.

The Board notes that in every instance where the schedule does not provide a 0-percent rating for a diagnostic code, 0 percent will be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Based on the foregoing findings and the application of rating criteria from several DCs, there is no basis on which to assign an initial compensable rating. As stated, the reported lay observations of the Veteran himself were that the scars had stayed the same, he experiences no current symptoms, he had no current treatment, and he does not use any medications. 

The Board finds the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so in regard to the claim for a higher evaluation. As the evidence is decidedly and persuasively against the claim, the rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 780-81.

3. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation in excess of 20 percent for service-connected status post right-shoulder surgery/labral tear.

The Veteran contends that as his right-shoulder exhibits decreased range of motion and he experiences weakness and difficulty lifting, as well as chronic pain, his condition warrants a disability rating greater than 20 percent.

The March 2024 decision on appeal did not identify any favorable findings of fact.

The Veteran's right-shoulder condition currently is rated under DC 5019-5201. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires the use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Therefore, the Veteran was diagnosed with bursitis (DC 5019), the symptomatology of which is reflected in the rating criteria for limitation of arm motion (DC 5201). 

Both DC 5019 and DC 5201 were revised, effective February 7, 2021. As the pendency of this appeal begins with VA's receipt of the September 5, 2023 claim application, received by VA well beyond the revision date, pre-revision versions of the codes have not been considered.

DC 5019 appears in the rating schedule within a group of certain other codes. The rating schedule states those codes now are to be evaluated as degenerative arthritis, based on limitation of motion of affected parts. Degenerative arthritis is rated under DC 5010 (post-traumatic arthritis) and DC 5003 (other than post-traumatic arthritis). Although the Veteran's reports, set forth below, suggest the cause of Veteran's condition may be traumatic, the February 2024 VA examiner for shoulder conditions did not provide a finding indicating a specific type of arthritis.

DC 5010 directs the rater or adjudicator to rate as limitation of motion, dislocation, or other specified instability under the affected joint. If there are 2 or more joints affected, each rating shall be combined in accordance with §4.25. As it is, DC 5201 for limitation of motion of the arm has been assigned.

DC 5003 provides that degenerative arthritis established by X-ray findings will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved (DC 5200 etc.). When however, the limitation of motion of the specific joint or joints involved is noncompensable under the appropriate diagnostic codes, a rating of 10 percent is for application for each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion, to be combined, not added under DC 5003. Limitation of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful motion. In the absence of limitation of motion, with X-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups, with occasional incapacitating exacerbations, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted. With X-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted. Note (1) to the code states: The 20 percent and 10 percent ratings based on X-ray findings, above, will not be combined with ratings based on limitation of motion. Note (2) states: The 20 percent and 10 percent ratings based on X-ray findings, above, will not be utilized in rating conditions listed under DCs 5013 to 5024, inclusive. 38 CFR Part 4, Schedule for Rating Disability: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries; Correction, 85 Fed. Reg. 249, 85523 (December 29, 2020).

DC 5201 provides a 20 percent rating for both the major and minor extremities for limitation of motion of the arm at shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees). Limitation of motion of the arm midway between side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees) warrants a 20 percent rating for the minor extremity and a 30 percent rating for the major extremity. Flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from the side warrants a maximum 30 percent rating for the minor joint and a maximum 40 percent rating for the major joint. Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76463 (Nov. 30, 2020) ( now codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5201).

The rating schedule further provides that normal range of motion of the shoulder is flexion and abduction from 0 to 180 degrees, and internal and external rotation each to 90 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate I. Abduction is the motion of lifting the arm from the side, with 0 degrees representing the arm at the side and 90 degrees representing the arm at the shoulder level. Normal range of motion for internal and external rotational also is 90 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate I. The Board notes from relevant case law that DC 5201 "does not provide separate ratings for limitation of motion in the flexion and abduction planes, but rather is addressed generically to limitation of motion of the arm." Yonek v. Shinseki, 722 F.3d 1355, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

In order to afford the Veteran every possible opportunity to attain the highest evaluation allowed under the regulations, the Board also has looked to analogous or closely related diagnostic codes pertaining to the shoulder, They are related by symptomatology and anatomical location, Separate disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); see also Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment). Analogous or closely related diagnostic codes are addressed below, as they become relevant in the discussion of the evidence.

Turning to the record, the Veteran during the appeal period underwent a February 2024 VA examination for shoulder conditions. The examiner first noted that the Veteran is right-hand dominant. The Veteran reported his condition had worsened. He reported current symptoms of aching and deep bone pain. The Veteran sometimes has difficulty raising his arm over his head after sleeping on it the wrong way. He experiences decreased range of motion and weakness. The Veteran has difficulty lifting due to pain and weakness, described as aching, sharp pain. The Veteran added he has to be careful with lifting his children due to aching sharp pains.

Before range-of-motion testing, the Veteran also reported he experiences flare-ups. They occur a couple times a month and they last 1-2 days. During a flare-up, pain is constant, almost like a spasm or cramp on the inside and with a sensation of burning, increased stiffness and decreased range of motion. Flares are precipitated by repetitive motion such as weeding or by reaching up to change a light bulb or working above head level. The Veteran further reported he avoids any kind of heavy lifting, any type of overhead reaching and bending down and picking something up straight off the floor. The Veteran again added that when lifting up his children he feels like he might drop them due to pain. The Veteran noted that he has more pain sleeping with the flare-ups if laying on his right shoulder. The Veteran also reported the same description of the effects of functional loss after repeated use over time.

Initial right-shoulder active range-of-motion testing showed the following: 

Flexion	0-150 of 180 (normal) Degrees

Abduction	0-145/180 Degrees

Internal rotation	0-75/90 Degrees

External rotation	0-50/90 Degrees

The examiner noted pain on examination in each of the above maneuvers. 

The examiner further found passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion, also with pain noted in each maneuver. The examiner found evidence of pain in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing, as well as in active motion and passive motion. Pain caused functional loss, as described above by the Veteran. Correia,  28 Vet. App. at 168.  

There was objective evidence of crepitus. The Veteran was able to perform right-shoulder repetitive-use testing with at least three repetitions. The effects were as follows:

Flexion	0-150/180 Degrees

Abduction	0-135/180 Degrees

Internal rotation	0-75/90 Degrees

External rotation	0-45/90 Degrees

The examiner found pain, weakness, fatigability, and lack of endurance caused the functional loss.

The Veteran was not examined immediately after repetitive use over time. She provided the following estimated range-of-motion measurements. 

Flexion	0-145/180 Degrees

Abduction	0-130/180 Degrees

Internal rotation	0-70/90 Degrees

External rotation	0-40/90 Degrees

The examiner found pain, weakness, fatigability, and lack of endurance caused functional loss. 

The Veteran was not examined during a flare-up. The examiner therefore provided the following estimated measurements.

Flexion	0-145/180 Degrees

Abduction	0-130/180 Degrees

Internal rotation	0-70/90 Degrees

External rotation	0-40/90 Degrees

The examiner noted that pain, weakness, and lack of endurance caused functional loss. Sharp, 29 Vet. App. at 34-36.

The examiner found no muscle atrophy or ankylosis. The Veteran's right shoulder was positive in the Lift-off Subscapularis Test. During such testing, a patient internally rotates the affected arm behind the lower back and pushes against examiner's hand. Weakness indicates a "positive" test, which may indicate subscapularis tendinopathy or tear. Results were negative for the Hawkins Impingement Test, the Empty-Can Test and the External Rotation/Infraspinatus Strength Test. 

The examiner found there is right-shoulder "instability, dislocation or labral pathology," as well as "mechanical" symptoms, such as clicking, catching, etc. There were no current residuals of recurrent dislocation (subluxation) of the glenohumeral (scapulohumeral) joint. The examiner found no clavicle, scapula, acromioclavicular (AC) joint, and sternoclavicular joint conditions. However, she noted tenderness on palpation of the AC joint. There were no conditions or impairments of the humerus. The examiner noted the Veteran's previous surgery in November 2010 for labrum repair. She further noted its residuals of pain, stiffness, decreased range of motion, and weakness.

The Veteran did not report use of assistive devices. There were no imaging studies for the examination. The examiner described functional impact the Veteran's ability to work was he would not be able to work a position that involves lifting anything heavier than 30 pounds or repetitive overhead lifting of his arm.

Although the February 2024 examiner did not find ankylosis, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) has noted that the criteria for a rating based on ankylosis may be met by evidence demonstrating the "functional equivalent" of ankylosis. Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 20 (2021). Therefore, ankylosis pertaining to the Veteran's right-shoulder condition could be shown by functional loss consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis under the General Rating Formula. Essentially, ankylosis indicates "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure." DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY, 94 (32nd ed. 2012).

The February 2024 VA examination does not show such reports by the Veteran or in examination findings. For example, the Veteran reported in the examination that sometimes has difficulty raising his arm over his head after sleeping on it the wrong way. He further reported that he avoids any kind of heavy lifting, any type of overhead reaching and bending down and picking something straight off the floor. As stated, the examiner found the impact of the functional loss caused by the Veteran's condition on his ability to work is the inability to lift anything heavier than 30 pounds or repeatedly lift his arm above his head.

The above reports of the Veteran and the examiner's prospective assessment of the Veteran's capability in the workplace implicitly indicate that, nonetheless, the Veteran can move his right shoulder and arm. Possible difficulty at home or at work such as "repeatedly" lifting his arm over his head or lifting something described as "heavy" are not reasonable equivalents to the inability to move at all the right shoulder.  The Board therefore finds ankylosis cannot be established by functional loss consistent with or equivalent to ankylosis, as contemplated under the General Rating Formula. Chavis, 34 Vet. App. at 20.

Additionally, the Board notes that the Veteran reported in the examination that he takes ibuprofen as needed. The Court has held the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not contemplated specifically by the rating criteria. Jones, 26 Vet. App. at 61. The relevant rating criteria make no mention of medication. Under Jones, the Board therefore must consider that the Veteran's right-shoulder condition would be worse without the ibuprofen. 

However, the Board finds any ameliorative effects of ibuprofen do not change the Board's analysis of the disability rating for right-shoulder condition. For example, the Veteran's reports do not indicate and the February 2024 examiner did not find any discernible improvement pertaining to the Veteran's functional loss with the use of ibuprofen. Moreover, the Veteran reported it is used "as needed," thereby suggesting that functional loss was not noticeably improved with ibuprofen, otherwise the Veteran likely would be using it regularly. The Board therefore can reasonably conclude that the Veteran's condition would not necessarily be worse without ibuprofen. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. at 61. Therefore, the Board further finds there is sufficient evidence to rate the disability without an opinion regarding the ameliorative effects of ibuprofen. Ingram v. Collins, Vet. App. No. 23-1798 (March 12, 2025).

The record shows the only treatment notes of record are 2012 right-shoulder treatment notes in connection with a Medical Evaluation Board referral to VA for treatment during the Veteran's military service. However, the appeal period for the current claim began on September 5, 2023, the date the Veteran's claim was received by VA for this appeal. The record contains no VA or private medical records of treatment for the period on appeal. Additionally, as this is a claim for an increased rating, the Board has reviewed the evidence of record in a one-year "look-back" period from the appeal period's commencement. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d. 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010). However, the record for that period contains no medical evidence of treatment. 

The Board finds evidence reviewed for the appeal period supports the rating of 20 percent, as assigned in the March 2024 decision on appeal. The Board notes again that, under DC 5201, limitation of motion of the arm at shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees) warrants a 20 percent rating for both the major and minor extremity. The February 2023 examiner's findings show that flexion and abduction never were below 145 and 130 degrees, respectively. Those findings are the lowest range-of-motion measurements and they account for loss of motion both after repeated use over time and during flare-ups. Therefore, the current rating of 20 percent was assigned to compensate the Veteran, not based on actual range-of-motion measurements on examination, but rather on reports and findings of pain, weakness, fatigability, and lack of endurance limiting active and passive range of motion. See DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 205-06; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45.

Generally, functional loss due to pain is rated at the same level at which functional loss is impeded. Stated another way, range of motion may be possible beyond the point when pain sets in but, for rating purposes, only to the extent pain limits motion will be considered. Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 43. However, in considering the Veteran's reports and the examiner's findings of loss of motion due to pain, weakness, fatigability, and lack of endurance, there is no indication of greater pain on movement than that which already has been compensated in the 20-percent evaluation assigned for those causes of loss of motion.

The Board further finds the evidence does not support ratings higher than 20 percent. For example, as stated, the ratings for degenerative arthritis, other than traumatic under DC 5003 provide a maximum 20-percent rating for x-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major joints or 2 or more minor joint groups, with occasional incapacitating exacerbations. However, as the Veteran is already rated at 20 percent and an award of an additional 20 percent for the same symptomatology or body location would be impermissible "pyramiding" one identical rating upon another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. Moreover, the record does not show the required x-ray evidence and the VA examination contains no findings that a second major joint or two or more minor joint groups were involved.

As stated, DC 5201 for arm limitation provides a 30-percent rating of the dominant extremity for limitation of motion of the arm "midway between the side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees)." The Board understands this designation to mean that midway between side and shoulder level equates to flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees. There is no medical evidence which indicates range of motion limited to no more than 45 degrees. As the maximum rating of 40 percent (dominant hand) requires flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees, the Board notes again flexion and abduction were never below 145 and 130 degrees, respectively.

In looking to analogous or closely related diagnostic codes, the February 2024  examiner did not find ankylosis of scapulohumeral articulation (DC 5200). She did not find humerus impairment or malunion (DC 5202). The examiner did not find dislocations or malunion of the clavicle or scapula (DC 5203). As it is, DC 5203 does not offer ratings higher than 20 percent, already assigned in the current evaluation. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

For the three claims on appeal, the Board has carefully considered the Veteran's lay evidence in the form of his reports to the examiners. Lay persons are competent to report on matters observed or within their personal knowledge. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). Therefore, the Veteran is competent to provide statements of symptoms which are observable and perceived through his senses. Nonetheless, the Veteran's lay evidence in turn must be weighed against other evidence, as all relevant evidence of varying kinds must be considered. See Caluza, 7 Vet. App. at 511.

The Board assigns more probative weight to the findings of the VA examiner. She is a medical professionals who examined and tested the Veteran during an in-person session, she thoroughly reviewed the Veteran's medical history and record and her findings, for the reasons stated above, are therefore adequate for VA rating purposes. Cf. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-04 (2008) (the central issue in assessing the adequacy of an opinion is whether the examiner was informed of the relevant facts in rendering a medical opinion).

The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record for the Board's consideration. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017).

For the reasons stated and based on the evidence of record, the Board finds the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so in regard to the claim for an increased rating in excess of 20 percent. 

The Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. However, as the evidence is decidedly and persuasively against the claim, the rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 780-81.
