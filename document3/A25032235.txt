CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for pes planus with plantar fascia pathology are met. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to October 9, 2018, for entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.159, 3.160, 3.400, 20.1104.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of February 13, 2019, but no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.159, 3.160, 3.400, 20.1104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1954 to May 1956. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 and February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to a compensable rating for hemorrhoids and entitlement to total disability due to individual unemployability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that the AOJ requested the Veteran submit any relevant private treatment records or submit information with which VA can assist the Veteran in obtaining private treatment records.  Required notice and information were provided in the claim form which the Veteran signed, certifying to the fact that such notice was received and further than they have included or identified relevant evidence. VA requested records for which the Veteran submitted a proper release and/or adequately identified. The duty to assist is not a one-way street. If a Veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining evidence. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). Thus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the duty to assist. No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in development. Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).

The standard set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) only permits constructive receipt of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records that not only existed prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, but also for which the claimant furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of those records. Thus, the Board's consideration of VHA records is limited to the same.  Here, the Board finds that VA treatment records were obtained and reviewed consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) and the AMA framework.

38 C.F.R. § 3.103 provides that a Veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim.  The Board observes that notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing at the AOJ was not provided in this case. In Bowen, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested hearing before the AOJ because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a hearing before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253 (2012). Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket. Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.

Service Connection

1. Entitlement to service connection for pes planus with plantar fascia pathology is granted. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for plantar fasciitis because it developed as a result of military service or, in the alternative is secondary to his service connected back disability. 

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For secondary service connection, it must be shown that the disability for which the claim is made is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury, or that service-connected disease or injury has aggravated (increased in severity) the nonservice-connected disability for which service connection is sought.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The Veteran filed an initial claim for plantar fasciitis in November 2019. The claim was denied in a March 2019 rating decision. The Veteran filed a supplemental claim in March 2020 (within one year of the rating decision) and an April 2022 rating decision again denied the claim on the merits. The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 in April 2023. An August 2023 Board decision remanded the Veteran's claim for further development, and a November 2023 rating decision again denied the claim. The Veteran filed his VA Form 10182 in November 2024. 

During the period on appeal, a June 2018 VA treatment record notes that the Veteran has bilateral pes planus. June 2021 VA treatments suggest that the Veteran has symptoms of plantar fasciitis.  This evidence establishes a current disability. 

With respect to service connection on a direct basis, the record contains no evidence of an in-service injury or event related to pes planus or plantar fasciitis and no evidence of a nexus between the Veteran's military service and pes planus or plantar fasciitis. 

In February 2025, the Veteran submitted a private opinion with regard to his feet disability. The clinician opined that the Veteran has bilateral pes planus with plantar fascia pathology, more likely than not secondary to his service connected back condition (intervertebral disc syndrome "IVDS") which causes chronic low back pain. The clinician also noted that sciatic radiculopathy (secondary to the Veteran's service connected IVDS) is more likely than not a significant contributing factor for the development and persistence of the Veteran's bilateral foot disability. In support of this opinion the clinician provided medical literature as well as cited to evidence of record which shows ongoing low back pain and bilateral foot pain and symptoms. 

The Board affords weight to this opinion as it is consistent with and supported by the evidence of record. 

Ultimately, based on evidence of a current disability but no in-service injury, service connected on a direct basis is not established. However, based on evidence of a current disability, and a probative opinion which establishes that the Veteran's pes planus is aggravated by the Veteran's IVDS, which he is service connected for, service connection for pes planus with plantar fascia pathology is established on a secondary basis. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus with plantar fascia pathology secondary to IVDS is granted. 

Effective Date

The effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application thereof.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 9, 2018, for the grant of service connection for hemorrhoids. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to October 9, 2018, for the grant of service connection for hemorrhoids. 

The Veteran filed a notice of intent to file a claim which was postmarked October 5, 2018. Thereafter, in November 2018 the Veteran filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids. The claim was denied in a March 7, 2019, rating decision. Rather than appealing the March 2019 rating decision, the Veteran filed a new claim for service connection for hemorrhoids on November 12, 2019, and a supplemental claim on March 4, 2020. An April 2022 rating decision again denied the claim. The Veteran continued to pursue his claim by filing a VA Form 10182 in April 2023. An August 2023 Board decision remanded the claim.  Thereafter, a November 2023 rating decision granted service connection for hemorrhoids with a noncompensable rating effective October 9, 2018. 

Private treatment records show that the Veteran has suffered from hemorrhoids as remotely as December 2007. Here, because the Veteran filed a claim in October 2018 that was denied, and subsequently filed a new claim on November 12, 2019, the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date more than one year prior to the November 2019 claim. As such, October 9, 2018, is the earliest effective date the Veteran is entitled to. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date of February 13, 2018, for the grant of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. In February 2025 correspondence, the Veteran's representative argued that an effective date of February 22, 2019, the date entitlement arose because the Veteran has been prescribed a CPAP for his sleep apnea since February 22, 2019. 

The Veteran initially filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea in November 2018.  A March 7, 2019, rating decision denied the claim.  The Veteran filed a supplemental claim on March 4, 2020, seeking service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  An April 2022 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim.  The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 in April 2023, and an August 2023 Board decision remanded the Veteran's claim for further development.  Following the Board's remand, a February 2024 rating decision granted service connection for obstructive sleep apnea with a 50 percent evaluation effective August 10, 2022.  The Veteran filed the current VA Form 10182 in November 2024 seeking an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. 

The Veteran's November 2018 initial claim was filed in the legacy review system (see 38 C.F.R. §19.2 noting that the effective date of the modernized review system is February 19, 2019).  However, the modernized review system applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after the effective date of the modernized review system (February 19, 2019).  38 C.F.R.  § 3.2400.  Here, the Veteran's rating decision was issued March 7, 2019.  Under the modernized review system, the effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date that is one year before the date of receipt of the application. 38 U.S.C. 5110 (b)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).

Evidence of record shows that the Veteran underwent a diagnostic polysomnogram on February 13, 2019.  The impression was moderate obstructive sleep apnea, and it was recommended that the Veteran start using a CPAP.  There is no evidence prior to February 13, 2019 which shows a diagnosis of or treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.  Based on this evidence, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of February 13, 2019, for the grant of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  

Entitlement to an effective date of February 13, 2019, for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

3. Entitlement to a compensable rating for hemorrhoids is remanded.

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for obstructive sleep apnea is remanded. 

5. Entitlement to total disability due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR THE REGIONAL OFFICE (RO) ADJUDICATOR:

This is a remand to cure a predecisional duty to assist error. 

a)	The Veteran is seeking entitlement to an increased rating for his hemorrhoid disability, which is currently rated as noncompensable. VA treatment records throughout the period on appeal, including October 2019 and October 2023 note that the Veteran's has taken medication for his hemorrhoids including a suppository. In evaluating an increased rating claim, the Board is required to discount the ameliorative effects of medication. In order to do so, the Board must know what those are.  Remand is warranted to assess the beneficial effects of the Veteran's medication. 

b)	The Veteran is seeking entitlement to an increased rating for obstructive sleep apnea. As discussed above, the Board has granted an earlier effective date for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. Accordingly, the claim must be remanded to determine the initial rating in the first instance. 

c)	A claim for entitlement total disability due to individual unemployability (TDIU) was raised by the record. As the assessment of the aforementioned claim for an increased rating for hemorrhoids could impact the TDIU claim, the claim for TDIU is inextricably intertwined and must be remanded. 

THE REMAND DIRECTIVES FOLLOW

2. Obtain an opinion regarding the following from an appropriate examiner.

(a)	Clearly indicate whether any medications (over the counter or prescription) the Veteran used affected the level of severity of his hemorrhoid disability as of the October 2023 examination.

(b)	If any such medication was productive of ameliorative affects, clearly identify such effects and opine as to the severity of the hemorrhoid disability absent such medication as of the October 2023 examination. 

All opinions must be based on a review of all evidence of record and supported by adequate rationale. 

The Board notes that the claims folder must be provided to and reviewed by the examiner for all post-remand cases per AOJ policy. See VBA Manual M21-1, Part IV.i.2.A.8.b. Thus, the examiner must specifically note that the claims folder was received and reviewed in the body of the examination report.
