ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, malignant skin neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain behavior is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, malignant skin neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain behavior are related to herbicide agent exposure in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, malignant skin neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain behavior have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 1110, 1116, 5107(b) (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1968 to July 1972, with service in Vietnam.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on April 3, 2025. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). The Board notes that the Veteran waived the remaining period after his hearing to submit evidence. See April 2025 Board hearing. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the requirement that the Board delay issuing a decision until the period to request to switch dockets elapses pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024). Nonetheless, the grant herein is considered a full grant of the benefit sought. Therefore, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with adjudication. 

Entitlement to service connection for skin cancer.

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection requires evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Veterans who served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War era are presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents in service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(ii).

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) requires that, when a veteran whose active service subjected the veteran to participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) files a claim to service connect a disability and there is evidence of such disability, VA must provide the veteran with a VA examination and obtain a medical opinion addressing the possibility of a nexus between the claimed disability and the TERA, unless the Secretary of VA determines that there is no indication of an association between the disability claimed by the veteran and the TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168. 

One such exception to obtaining a TERA medical opinion pursuant to the PACT Act found by the Secretary is for conditions determined to have no positive association with herbicide agent exposure, which includes conditions determined by the Secretary based on cumulative scientific data reported by the National Academies of Science since 1993. Nonmelanoma skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell) is included as part of the exception found to have no positive association with herbicide agent exposure. Veterans Benefits Administration Letter 20-24-06, Updated Guidance on Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 89 Fed. Reg. 51,224 (Jun. 17, 2024).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

A September 2024 VA examiner diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, malignant skin neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain behavior. Thus, the first element of service connection is conceded. 

The Veteran served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War era. See, e.g., September 2023 VA memorandum. He is thus presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents in service and the second element of service connection is conceded. However, the Board notes that exposure to ionizing radiation is not conceded.

The September 2024 VA examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's conditions are related to herbicide agent exposure in service after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic combined effect of all TERAs. The examiner discussed that the Veteran had no history of any type of skin cancer prior to his military service and noted that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents, other fuels and fumes, and ionizing radiation. Two medical articles were provided that showed these toxic substances had a high prevalence in causing skin cancers.

Later in September 2024, the AOJ requested an addendum opinion from the September 2024 VA examiner because exposure to ionizing radiation was not conceded. The examiner again opined it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's conditions are related to herbicide agent exposure in service after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic combined effect of all TERAs. The examiner stated that herbicide agent exposure has been shown to cause indirect DNA damage, producing skin malignancies.

The Board finds the September 2024 VA examiner's addendum medical opinion to be adequate for appellate review. The examiner relied on examination of the Veteran and a review of the file, and he provided a full and detailed rationale that included discussion of the Veteran's disabilities of record and lay statements of reported history. The Board acknowledges that the Secretary found that there was an exception to the requirements of the PACT Act for nonmelanoma skin cancers. However, the Board finds that the Secretary's exception to the PACT Act does not prevent awarding service connection on a direct basis. Here, the Board finds that the September 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's skin cancer disabilities were related to herbicide agent exposure on a direct basis and assigns the addendum opinion significant probative weight accordingly.

The probative evidence of record reflects that the Veteran's squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, malignant skin neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain behavior are related to his herbicide agent exposure in service. Thus, service connection is warranted.
