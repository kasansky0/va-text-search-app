REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided to the Veteran on May 6, 2024, is remanded.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1965 to December 1968.

The decision on appeal was issued in November 2024 by the VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Although one year has not passed since the Veteran was notified of the November 2024 decision on appeal, the Board can proceed because the Veteran cannot switch his AMA docket choice as he has already submitted evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of non-VA services provided to the Veteran on May 6, 2024, is remanded.  

The Veteran seeks payment or reimbursement for non-VA emergency room services provided on May 6, 2024, at Flagstaff Medical Center. 

The claim was denied in a November 2024 decision which found, in pertinent part, that the claim was not filed within 90 days after the latest of the following: a) the date the Veteran were discharged from the facility that furnished the emergency treatment; b) the date of death; or c) The date the Veteran finally exhausted, without success, action to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party.  38 C.F.R. § 17.1004(d).     

VHA records reflect that authorization was approved for the outpatient emergency medical services provided on May 6, 2024, under 38 U.S.C. § 1725.  The records also indicate that the Veteran had Medicare Part A insurance.

A threshold requirement for reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 is that the claim for payment or reimbursement is timely filed.  For the claim to be timely, a claimant must file within 90 days after the latest of the following:

(1) The date that the veteran was discharged from the facility that furnished the emergency treatment; or

(2) The date of death, but only if the death occurred during transportation to a facility for emergency treatment or if the death occurred during the stay in the facility that included the provision of the emergency treatment; or

(3) The date the veteran/claimant finally exhausted, without success, action to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party.

See 38 C.F.R. § 17.1004(d)(1)-(3).

In this case, the record does not contain a copy of the initial claim for reimbursement beyond an eCAMS screenshot which indicates the claim was received on October 23, 2024.  VA Emergency Care Reporting records indicate that a claim number was created in July 2024 for the episode of care which was authorized under 38 U.S.C. § 1725, which would have been within 90 days of the episode of care.  In evidence submitted with the VA Form 10182, the Veteran stated that after he received bills six or seven weeks after the treatment, he contacted VA Community Care.  The Veteran stated that the medical bills were never sent to the correct VA departments.  He stated that the bills were often submitted to TriWest, a VA third party administrator, but he later found out that the bills should have gone to the Tampa Bay, Florida, VA administration department.  

Although a January 2025 Report of Contact indicates that there was one claim on file within eCAMS, FBCS-Archive, Optum or TriWest, the Veteran's statements and VA Emergency Care Reporting records indicate there may have been previous claims submitted to TriWest.  As the Veteran also had Medicare, and there is no Explanation of Benefits of record or referenced in the decision, it is also unclear whether the October 2024 claim was submitted within 90 days of exhaustion of action to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party. 

Accordingly, remand is necessary to associate all records pertaining to the initial claim for reimbursement and all records relating to whether the Veteran or provider exhausted, without success, action to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party (such as Medicare).  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) ("The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.").?

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Associate with the electronic claims file all evidence considered in connection with the claim.  The record should include, but is not limited to: 

All claims received regarding the May 6, 2024, episode of care, to include all claims and correspondence received by VHA and TriWest from the provider and Veteran, records relating to the creation of the July 2024 claim number, any Explanation of Benefits, and all records relating to whether the Veteran or provider had exhausted, without success, action to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party (such as Medicare).  

If any such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the Veteran with notice of the unavailability of records.
