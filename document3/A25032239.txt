ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for lupus is withdrawn and is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On August 26, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant that a withdrawal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for lupus is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal for entitlement to service connection for lupus by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1985 to August 2005.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal issued on October 4, 2023. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Withdrawal and Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

On August 26, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-4138 (Statement in Support of Claim). In that statement, the Veteran stated that he wanted to withdraw his BVA appeal, submitted by his representative on May 29, 2024, for the rating decision dated on October 4, 2023.  The record showed that on May 29, 2024, the Veteran's representative submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement with the October 4, 2023, rating decision denying service connection for lupus. In the statement requesting to withdraw the appeal for service connection for lupus, the Veteran identified himself, the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a clear statement of intent to withdraw this appeal in its entirety. Accordingly, the Board finds that the withdrawal is effective. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b); Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).

Hence, since the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remains no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
