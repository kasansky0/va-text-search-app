DOCKET NO. 240828-470313
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to the claim of entitlement to service connection for migraine headache disorder is dismissed.

The appeal as to the claim of entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

Following receipt of the August 28, 2024, VA Form 10182 pertaining to the denial of the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for migraine headache disorder and fibromyalgia, VA received a clear statement from the Veteran dated November 4, 2024, that included the Veteran's name, file number, docket number, and a request to withdraw these appeals. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal of entitlement to service connection for migraine headache disorder by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2.  The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal of entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Marine Corps from June 2018 to January 2023.  His service was under honorable conditions. 

The matter is on appeal from February 2024 and August 2024 rating decisions issued by a VA Regional Office (RO). 

The Veteran chose to participate in VA's test program "RAMP", the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program.  This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.  The Veteran opted into RAMP on August 28, 2024, and selected the Direct Review Lane.  As explained on the RAMP Opt-In Election Form, the review is based on evidence submitted to VA as of the date of the election, and the Veteran may not submit additional evidence. Thereafter, in subsequent correspondence, the Board accepted the Veteran's appeal and placed it on the Direct Review docket.  Under Direct Review, the Board will consider all evidence of record up to August 28, 2024.  The Board has not considered any evidence received or submitted after the August 2024 RAMP Opt-In Election. 

1.  Entitlement to service connection for migraine headache disorder. 

See section 2 below

2.  Entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

In the present case, the Veteran submitted a statement dated November 4, 2024 (after the date of the appeal presently before the Board), indicating that he is respectfully requesting to withdraw all of the issues pertaining to his August 28, 2024, Notice of disagreement (entitlement to service connection for a migraine headache disorder and entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia) regarding rating decision dated February 14, 2024, and August 27, 2024. 

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.205(b)(1).  These factors have been met in the present case.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeals, and they are dismissed.
