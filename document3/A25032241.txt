CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 14, 2022, has been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 14, 2022, has been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Coast Guard from January 1999 to July 2004.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2022 decision.  In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2022 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 decision.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of increased rating for left lower extremity and right lower extremity, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to an effective date of October 20, 2014, for service connection of radiculopathy, right lower sciatic nerve is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of October 20, 2024, for service connection of radiculopathy, left lower sciatic nerve is granted. 

The Veteran contends he is entitled to the same effective date for his bilateral radiculopathy as his service-connected back condition. See August 2024 Representative Letter.  

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an inial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An initial claim includes a new claim requesting service connection and a claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2019). The earliest date of entitlement to an increase in disability compensation is the date at which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). When medical records indicate an increase in a disability, receipt of such medical records may be used to establish effective dates for retroactive benefits based on facts found of an increase in a disability only if a complete claim or intent to file a claim for an increase is received within one year of the date of the report of examination, hospitalization, or medical treatment. Id. 

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014). The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are: (1) intent to apply for benefits; (2) identification of the benefits sought; and (3) communication in writing. See Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

From March 24, 2015, a claim must be filed on a designated VA form. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2018); 79 Fed. Reg. 57, 696 (Sept. 25, 2014).

Prior to February 19, 2019, a final claim is one in which the period to file a notice of disagreement has expired or there is a disposition on appellate review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d). A claimant must file notice of disagreement within one year from the date that notice of the determination is mailed to him or her. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52. A decision will not become final if new and relevant evidence is submitted within one year of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). 

After March 24, 2015, aside from submitting a formal claim, a Veteran may file an intent to file a claim via a saved electronic application, written intent on a prescribed intent to file a claim form, or oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel and recorded in writing. If VA receives a complete application appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. If any communication indicating a desire for benefits is not completed by one of these three options, then such communication is considered a request for an application form for benefits and has no impact on effective dates, which is governed based upon when the formal claim is received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (2018).

After February 19, 2019, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the following administrative review options after any decision by the agency of original jurisdiction, Board, or by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), provided that any appeal to the Court is timely filed as determined by the Court: (1) following the notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, requesting a higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board; (3) following notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court; and (4) following a decision on an appeal to the Court, the claimant may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). 

Except as otherwise provided by other previsions of this part, including 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options listed in 38 C.F.R. §3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision, provided that any appeal to the Court must be accepted as timely by that court. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). 

Here, the Veteran was granted service connection for his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy with an effective date of September 14, 2022.  See September 2022 Rating Decision. The Veteran was service connected for radiculopathy as part of the grant for his service-connected back condition, which has an effective date of October 20, 2014, based on the date of his claim for service connection for his back. See September 2022 Rating Decision. While the neurological complications secondary to a spinal condition do not remain part and parcel of a spinal claim once they have been separately addressed and adjudicated in a VA decision, they must be considered and properly compensated by VA when they are raised by a veteran or reasonably raised by the record. See generally, De Hart v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 371 (U.S. 2024). 

Here, the Veteran filed his claim for service connection for his back condition on October 20, 2014, and attached private treatment records to support his claim. In the October 2014 private treatment records, the Veteran was noted to back and bilateral leg pain and numbness. The October 2014 private treatment records went on to not the Veteran was experiencing bilateral aching and throbbing that radiated into bilateral L5 and S1 distribution and bilateral paresthesias. The Veteran was denied service connection for his back condition in a July 2015 rating decision which the Veteran timely appealed. The Veteran continued to pursue his claim for service connection for his back condition until it was granted in the September 2022 rating decision on appeal. Here, the Board finds the Veteran's rating for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was part and parcel of his service-connected spine claim; and therefore, should be granted the same effective date of October 20, 2014. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an increased evaluation of radiculopathy, right lower extremity, sciatic nerve, which is currently 10 percent disabling, is remanded.

2. Entitlement to an increased evaluation of radiculopathy, left lower extremity, sciatic nerve, which is currently 10 percent disabling, is remanded.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an initial rating for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy in excess of 10 percent. See August 2024 VA Form 10182: Notice of Disagreement. 

In general, disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disabilities adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set for the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Here, the Veteran's bilateral radiculopathy is rated under diagnostic code 8520 for the sciatic nerve. The Board has identified a duty to assist error that occurred before the September 2022 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Veteran was afforded a VA Examination for his back condition in September 2022; however, the examiner failed to fully address the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. Specifically, the examiner failed to address whether the Veteran experienced any paralysis as a result of the radiculopathy. Therefore, the Board finds this exam to be inadequate and cannot make a fully informed decision on this issue. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). The Board must remand this matter for an adequate opinion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of the service-connected bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.  

In so doing, the examiner must test the Veteran's active motion, passive motion, and pain with weight-bearing and without weight-bearing.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

In so doing, the examiner must attempt to elicit information regarding the severity, frequency, and duration of any flare-ups, and the degree of functional loss during flare-ups.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement based on direct observation, the examiner should provide an estimate, if at all possible, of the additional impairment due to flare-ups based on the other evidence of record and the Veteran's statements.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

The examiner should also address whether the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy requires the use of medication and the severity of the Veteran's condition without the remedial affects of medication. If the examiner unable to render such opinion, please provide an explanation why such opinion cannot be rendered.
