DOCKET NO. 210622-167519
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an increased evaluation for temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ) based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) is dismissed.

Entitlement to an increased evaluation of residuals of fracture of left mandible based on CUE is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has failed to identify a rating decision containing CUE and has not clearly and specifically set forth the basis for the application for revision because of asserted CUE in the evaluation of TMJ.

2. The Veteran has failed to identify a rating decision containing CUE and has not clearly and specifically set forth the basis for the application for revision because of asserted CUE in the evaluation of residuals of fracture of left mandible.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 

1. Because the pleading requirements of a motion for revision of a decision based on CUE have not been met, the motion for TMJ must be dismissed without prejudice to refiling. 38 U.S.C. § 5112, 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a), 20.205. 

2. Because the pleading requirements of a motion for revision of a decision based on CUE have not been met, the motion for residuals of fracture of left mandible must be dismissed without prejudice to refiling. 38 U.S.C. § 5112, 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a), 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c). 38 U.S.C. § 7101(a)(2).

The Veteran served on active duty in the Marine Corps from February 1968 to November 1969. 

In April 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ/RO) issued a decision denying the Veteran's claims on appeal. In the June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. The Board notes that the evidentiary window based on the Veteran's selections is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the AOJ issued notice of the applicable decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.

On July 30, 2024, the Veteran testified before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) at a Board hearing. The VLJ who conducts a Board hearing in the modernized review system is not required to decide the appeal. Frantzis v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 354 (2022).

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to an increased evaluation for TMJ based on CUE.

2. Entitlement to an increased evaluation of residuals of fracture of left mandible based on CUE.

The Veteran seeks increased evaluations for his TMJ and residuals of fracture of left mandible based on CUE.

After review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran has not specified a final rating decision he challenges as containing CUE, nor has he properly stated the basis for his application. The Board will therefore dismiss the application without prejudice to a refiling.

The law specifies that broad brush allegations of "failure to follow regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of error cannot constitute a valid claim for CUE.  Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 44.  The Court has further noted that a breach of VA's duty to assist cannot form a basis for a claim of CUE.  Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1994).  Thus, as a threshold matter, a claimant must plead CUE with sufficient particularity.  Only if this threshold requirement is met does the Board have any obligation to address the merits of the CUE claim.  See Phillips v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 25 (1997).

Here, in the Veteran's March 2021 motion and July 2024 Board Hearing, he essentially indicated that increased evaluations are warranted due to the August 1970 VA examiner failing to properly assess him, thus making the examination inadequate, but failed to clearly identify the rating decision being collaterally attacked. Further, CUE must be pled with some degree of specificity as to what the alleged error is and, unless it is the kind of error that if true would be CUE on its face, the claimant must also give persuasive reasons as to why the result of the prior determination would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error. Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 44 (1993); see also Phillips v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 25 (1997) (distinguishing denial of CUE due to pleading deficiency and denial of CUE on merits). The March 2021 motion and July 2024 Board Hearing does not identify a specific error for the Board to review besides discussion of the examination/examiner and its/his alleged inadequacies; however, there is no reasoning provided to explain why increased evaluations are warranted based on CUE beyond consistently mentioning VA's failure in its duty to assist, which as a matter of law, is insufficient to form a basis for a claim of clear and unmistakable error. Caffrey at 382. As noted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in Cook, the requirements that a clear and unmistakable error be both outcome determinative and based on the record that existed at the time of the original decision make it impossible for a breach of the duty to assist to form the basis for a CUE application. Cook, 318 F.3d at 1346.

Therefore, the proper remedy for the Board, when confronted with an inadequately pled CUE application is to dismiss the challenge without prejudice. Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104, 114 (2003). Therefore, the applications are dismissed without prejudice to refiling.
