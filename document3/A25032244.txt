REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1986 to February 1990.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Under the AMA, a record on appeal may be developed further by a remand to the AOJ when it has committed a pre-decisional, duty-to-assist error.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 20.802(a).  The error must have been committed prior to the issuance of the decision being reviewed.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(g).  When the Board identifies the error, then unless the highest level of the benefit sought can be awarded, the Board must return the appeal to the AOJ with instructions to correct the error.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(g).  A remand is also permitted under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) to satisfy a statutory or regulatory duty that could aid in substantiating the claim.  

Prior to the AOJ decision on appeal, the record reflects that there are outstanding private treatment records relevant to the claims.  VA clinic records show that that the Veteran was treated outside of VA for all medical needs for many years.  See CAPRI received by VA April 2024.  She receives VA community care, and some of those records have been scanned into VistA, but have not been associated with the claims folder.  VA has a duty to assist the Veteran in obtaining her private medical records which were identified prior to the rating decision on appeal, see Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377, 383 (1994) and those private records in VA's possession have not been associated with the claims folder.  The Board finds a pre-adjudicatory duty to assist error requiring a remand.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the claims folder records stored in VistA. See, e.g., VA Community Care-Consult Result Note, NonVA Consult, dated July 22, 2024 (VistA Imaging - Scanned Document).

2. Assist the Veteran in obtaining her complete private treatment records.  The AOJ's attention is directed to the following:

(a.) 3/5/2024 clinic record indicating that the Veteran has been seen outside of VA for all medical needs for many years, including injections, procedures, and MRIs.  See CAPRI received by VA April 2024.  

(b.) 3/5/2024 clinic record showing that the Veteran has been treated by a non-VA pain clinic.  See CAPRI received by VA April 2024.  

(c.) 3/19/2024 clinic record referencing that the Veteran was prescribed antibiotics by her non-VA primary care physician for possible oral lesions.  See CAPRI received by VA April 2024.
