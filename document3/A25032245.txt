REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1972 to August 1975.

The case is on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision from an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In August 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 to initiate an appeal on the Board's Hearing Docket.  In December 2024, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing.  Thus, the Board will review the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 decision on appeal and any evidence received at or within 90 days after the Board hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300, 20.302.

Although, in the May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ appears to have found that new and relevant evidence had not been submitted, see May 30, 2024 Notification Letter, the Board notes that the Veteran has since testified about his heart disorder, hearing loss, hypertension, and knee disorders at the December 2024 Board hearing and submitted additional evidence. Thus, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence is now of record to readjudicate the merits of the service connection claims currently on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a) (defining new and relevant evidence as evidence not previously of record that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the claim).

To ensure all diagnosed disorders are considered in adjudicating the claims on appeal, the Board has recharacterized the claim of service connection for atherosclerotic heart disease as one of entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

1. Service connection for a right knee disorder 

2. Service connection for a left knee disorder 

The Board finds that, based on the pre-decisional evidence of record, a remand is needed to obtain outstanding treatment records.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Specifically, the Board finds that an old x-ray referenced in VA treatment records is outstanding.

A February 2008 VA treatment record notes degenerative joint disease (DJD) on an old x-ray.  A July 2011 VA treatment record notes mild degenerative joint disease and peripheral atherosclerotic vascular disease.  An October 2017 VA treatment record notes that knee pain onset about 10 years ago.  A November 2018 VA treatment record notes the Veteran's report that knee pain started years ago without any specific event.

The outstanding question in this case that remains is the age and source of the "old x-ray" referenced in the February 2008 VA treatment record.  The Veteran reported in October 2017 that his knee pain had onset about 10 years prior, or in 2007.  The "old x-ray" could be only a few months old.  However, the x-ray could be older.  Thus, the date upon which the Veteran's DJD in the knees was first identified, and the date on which his symptoms began remains unclear in the pre-decisional evidence of record.  Though the Veteran testified at the Board hearing that he has had continuous VA treatment for his knees, this testimony was ambiguous.  Reading this testimony with the evidence currently of record, the Veteran was likely referencing having continuous treatment by VA since he was first seen for his knees which, on the current record, would likely be around 2007.  However, without additional information about the "old x-ray" referenced in the February 2008 VA treatment record, this remains unclear.  Thus, a remand is necessary to obtain information regarding the date of this "old x-ray."

3. Service connection for a heart disorder 

4. Service connection for hypertension 

The Board finds that, based on the pre-decisional evidence of record, a remand is needed to determine whether the Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange or other toxins during service.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

VA is to afford a veteran a VA medical examination whenever there is an indication that a currently diagnosed disorder might be related to service.  See McLendon, supra.  Under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), VA is to afford veterans examinations if they participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). 

The Veteran had a heart attack in December 2000 and has since been treated for various heart disorders such as coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.  VA treatment records also show a current diagnosis of hypertension.

In his August 2023 claims, the Veteran stated that he was exposed to Agent Orange when serving in Panama.  An August 2023 memorandum states that the Veteran was not exposed to Agent Orange during service.  However, it is unclear how the AOJ arrived at this conclusion, or if the AOJ ever asked the Veteran for details regarding his potential exposures to Agent Orange or other toxins.  Had such information been of record, the AOJ may have afforded the Veteran a VA examination of his heart disorder and hypertension.  The Veteran's attorney did submit information regarding potential toxic exposures in the Panama Canal Zone after the Board hearing.  Because this information was received after the rating decision on appeal, the Board may not remand for a new examination.

However, because it is unclear how the AOJ determined that the Veteran had not been exposed to Agent Orange or other toxic chemicals during service, the Board will remand the claim for the AOJ to decide whether further information is needed regarding the Veteran's exposure.  Based upon the information received on remand, the AOJ should determine whether to afford the Veteran VA examinations of his heart disorder and hypertension.

As a final matter, the Board notes that in his March 2024 Supplemental Claim, the Veteran claimed that he was diagnosed with hypertension during service.  However, there is no indication of a hypertension diagnosis or complaints of symptoms related to hypertension in service treatment records (STRs).  The Veteran may want to provide evidence of diagnosis or treatment for hypertension during service on remand.

5. Service connection for bilateral hearing loss 

The Board finds that, based on the pre-decisional evidence of record, a remand is needed to obtain a new medical opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination of his hearing loss in April 2024.  Audiometric testing showed that the Veteran had a hearing loss disability as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's hearing loss was less likely than not related to service because the Veteran's audiogram upon separation from service revealed hearing within normal limits.  In addition, hearing loss is also indicative of presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss.

However, this medical opinion ignores the Veteran's history of hearing loss upon entry into and during service.  Specifically, upon entry into service in November 1972, audiometric testing showed the following pure tone thresholds:

???????????? 	???????????? 	???????????? 	HERTZ??????????? 	???????????? 	???????????? 

Nov. 1972 	500????? 	1000???? 	2000???? 	3000???? 	4000???? 

RIGHT? 	25	20	25	X	45

LEFT? 	15	20	15	X	20

This demonstrates that, upon entry into service, the Veteran had a right ear hearing loss disability as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  However, the Veteran had normal left ear hearing.  See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157, 159 (1993) (holding that normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels and that service connection for hearing loss could be established even when a hearing loss disability as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 was not present upon separation from service). 

Just prior to separation from service, the Veteran's hearing was tested again in June 1975.  Pure tone thresholds were:

???????????? 	???????????? 	???????????? 	HERTZ??????????? 	???????????? 	???????????? 

June 1975 	500????? 	1000???? 	2000???? 	3000???? 	4000???? 

RIGHT? 	20	20	20	X	20

LEFT? 	20	20	20	X	20

An August 1975 STR notes that the Veteran had some deafness in both ears.

A remand is needed in order to obtain a new medical opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's hearing loss that acknowledges the Veteran's history of impaired hearing prior to and during service.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304, 3.306.  In remanding the claim, the Board notes that in his March 2024 Supplemental Claim, the Veteran claimed that his hearing loss is related to the long-term effect from continuous noise exposure.  Thus, on remand, the examiner should consider the long-term effects of noise exposure on hearing loss.  See McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243 (2019).

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain information regarding the date of the "old x-ray" of the Veteran's knees showing DJD referenced in the February 2008 VA treatment record.  With necessary assistance from the Veteran, make as many attempts as necessary to obtain the "old x-ray," unless the record does not exist or further attempts would be futile.  If the x-ray cannot be obtained, inform the Veteran consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e).

2. Obtain further information regarding the Veteran's TERAs (including claimed exposure to Agent Orange), and based upon such information, determine if the Veteran is entitled to TERA examinations of his heart disability and hypertension.

3. Obtain a new medical opinion to determine the etiology of the Veteran's hearing loss.  Specifically, the examiner should opine as to:

(A) Whether there was a worsening of the Veteran's right ear hearing loss disability during service.  Please note that a pure tone threshold of 45 decibels at the 4000 Hertz level was noted upon entry into service.

(B) If so, whether such worsening of the Veteran's right ear hearing loss was clearly and unmistakably due to the natural progression of the disease.

(C) Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss is related to service or onset within a year after separation from service.

A complete rationale should be provided for any opinion rendered.  Please consider the audiometric testing conducted on entry into and separation from service as well as the August 1975 STR noting some deafness in both ears.  Please also consider the long-term effects of noise exposure, such as delayed onset hearing loss, as discussed in the Institute of Medicine Study which found insufficient support for such a phenomenon but did not rule out the possibility that such a phenomenon exists.
