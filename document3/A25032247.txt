ORDER

Service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is granted.

Service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is granted.

Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is at least as likely as not related to presumed in-service exposure to herbicide agents.

2. The Veteran's right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is at least as likely as not related to presumed in-service exposure to herbicide agents.

3. The Veteran's PTSD is attributable to stressors associated with his service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307.

2. The criteria for service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307.

3. The criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1965 to July 1969. Unfortunately, the Veteran passed away in August 2023. The Appellant is his surviving spouse. Her request for substitution was granted in April 2024.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. At the outset the Board notes that the time to appeal the September 2022 rating decision had not expired at the time of the Veteran's passing. Additionally, the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) was received one month after substitution of the Appellant was granted. Therefore, the Board will consider the May 2024 Notice of Disagreement timely.

In the May 9, 2024, Notice of Disagreement, the Appellant elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant, or representative, with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Left and Right Lower Extremity Peripheral Neuropathy

The Appellant contends that the Veteran had bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy that was caused by military service.

In the September 2022 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ found that the Veteran had a current diagnosis of both left and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, the AOJ noted that the Veteran served in Vietnam from October 1966 to October 1967; it is therefore presumed that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents. The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). As such, the first two elements of service connection are satisfied.

Regarding the third element of service connection, the record contains a December 2021 letter dated September 2021 from the Veteran's treating physician. The letter states that the Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange while in-service and Agent Orange is a known cause of peripheral neuropathy.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2022. The examiner confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. However, an opinion regarding the etiology of his disability. 

The Appellant then subsequently submitted a private opinion in May 2024. This opinion again confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis. The examiner ultimately concluded that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy was the result of his exposure to Agent Orange in-service. Specifically, the private examiner noted that the Veteran did not have any documented signs of neuropathy prior to his service in Vietnam. The earliest documentation of peripheral vascular issues was in April 1970 when he complained of leg pain which was attributed to his varicose veins. The private examiner went on to note that the Veteran's pain continued and records in 2021 onwards document the progression of peripheral neuropathy, which starts with pain, sensory changes, and eventually progresses to weakness, gait instability, and frequent falls. 

The private examiner also cited several studies that link peripheral neuropathy to Agent Orange exposure. Further, although the private examiner conceded that the Veteran's neuropathy does not appear to be well documented until 2021 it was noted that the Veteran has had several evaluations, workups, and tests performed that noted pain, paresthesia, and motor weakness, which is likely related to Agent Orange exposure. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current left and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents. If the evidence is supportive or is in relative equipoise, then the veteran prevails. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Accordingly, after resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for left, and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is warranted.

PTSD

Similar to the criteria above, entitlement to service connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); (2) credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor occurred; and (3) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and the in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f); Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Regarding the first element of a service connection claim, a diagnosis, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2022. The examiner noted that the Veteran reported a stressor due to exposure to combat while service in Vietnam. The examiner found that this met criteria A for a PTSD diagnosis, however the examiner found the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis.

Conversely, the Appellant submitted a private examination in July 2024. The private examiner after review of the Veteran's medical records met the full criteria of PTSD and major depressive disorder. Based on the above, the Board finds the evidence is relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran had a diagnosis of PTSD. Accordingly, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the first element of a service connection claim has been met. 

Regarding the second element of a PTSD service connection claim, the AOJ, in the September 2022 decision on appeal, conceded a stressor on the basis of fear of hostile military or terrorist activity. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). As such, the first two elements of service connection are satisfied.

As for the third element, the Appellant submitted a private evaluation in July 2024. The private examiner concluded that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's PTSD developed because of his fear of hostile military activity while serving in Vietnam. Specifically, the examiner noted that the record shows the Veteran expressed a significant change following his deployment to Vietnam. Further, the examiner highlighted statements from the Appellant noting PTSD symptom expression. Specifically, the Appellant stated that when the Veteran returned from service he was "hot and cold" with his moods and his temperament, and no longer wanted to be around others. Therefore, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's PTSD developed because of his fear of hostile military activity while serving in Vietnam.  Therefore, resolving any doubts in his favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD is related to service, and service connection is warranted.
