DOCKET NO. 241011-483188
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity (RLE) peripheral neuropathy, sciatic nerve, is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity (LLE) peripheral neuropathy, sciatic nerve, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The appellant served in the Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) from September 24, 1967, to September 21, 1968; participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), exposure to herbicide agents, is conceded.

2. The appellant has current diagnoses of peripheral neuropathy, sciatic nerve, of the bilateral lower extremities.

3. The appellant's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any complaints of, or treatment for, peripheral neuropathy.

4. The appellant's peripheral neuropathy did not manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the last date on which the appellant was exposed to an herbicide agent during active service

5. The appellant's peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities did not manifest until many years after service discharge, the competent evidence does not relate this condition to herbicide agent exposure, and it is not otherwise related to his military service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for RLE peripheral neuropathy are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for LLE peripheral neuropathy are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant had active service in the United States Army from April 1967 to April 1969.  The appellant is a Purple Heart recipient.  

This appeal has been advanced on the Board of Veterans' Appeals' (Board) docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

These matters come before the Board on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ)), which denied service connection for RLE and LLE peripheral neuropathy.  In October 2024, the appellant submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD (via VA Form 10182)), appealing that decision to the Board, and requesting Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  

Finally, under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) the appellant has one year from his August 2024 rating decision to modify his choice of Board appeal lane, and the "Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up."  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  However, the appellant was provided with a letter in November 2024, informing him that the Board was not able to adjudicate his appeal until this period has ended unless he waived the right to request a different Board review option.  In December 2024, the appellant provided a waiver of his right to request a different Board review option.  As such, the Board may proceed to adjudicate the claims.

Evidentiary Window

Since the appellant selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182).  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The appellant has not filed such a request.  If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it.  If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy, sciatic nerve, of the bilateral lower extremities, is denied.

The appellant contends that service connection is warranted for his bilateral peripheral neuropathy due to in-service herbicide exposure.  See Fully Developed Claim, October 24, 2023.  

Applicable Law

Generally, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted for specific disabilities associated with exposure to herbicide agents, including early-onset peripheral neuropathy. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  These disabilities will be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated by service despite any lack of evidence of such disease during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a).  This presumption applies to veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam during January 9, 1962, to May 7, 1975, even if there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6).  While early-onset peripheral neuropathy is included among the list of diseases VA associates with herbicide agent exposure, 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(ii) requires that early-onset peripheral neuropathy manifest itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the last date on which the veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active service.

VA also considers peripheral neuropathy an organic disease of the nervous system, which is included among the chronic diseases that that may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree during service or in a specified period after service, usually one year.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  For the showing of a chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, provided that the diagnosis was noted during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Alternatively, service connection for chronic diseases can be granted on a presumptive basis when an in-service disease or injury and a nexus can be established through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology since service, provided that the diagnosis was noted during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

Analysis

Service connection is not warranted for right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy.

The August 2024 rating decision on appeal favorably found that the appellant had current diagnoses of bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerves and participated in a TERA (exposure to herbicide agents during his service in Vietnam.)  Favorable findings made by the AOJ are generally binding on the Board, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c); 20.801(a).  Such evidence is not present in this case.

Initially, although herbicide agent exposure has been conceded, the record does not reflect a diagnosis of early-onset peripheral neuropathy, and the appellant has not contended otherwise.  Specifically, the record demonstrates that peripheral neuropathy manifested many years after the appellant's herbicide agent exposure.  The earliest documentation of reports of numbness and tingling in the lower extremities was in 2010; over 40 years after discharge.  See VA Treatment Record, November 30, 2010.  As such, service connection is not warranted for early-onset peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities on a presumptive basis as due to herbicide agent exposure.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6)(ii), 3.309(e).  

Additionally, service connection is not warranted for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities as a chronic condition.  As noted, peripheral neuropathy was not diagnosed at any time during service, it did not manifest to a compensable degree within the presumptive period of one year, and it was not diagnosed until many years after service.  Continuity of symptomatology is not established.  As such, entitlement to service connection based on the chronic disease presumption would not be warranted if such presumption is applicable to peripheral neuropathy.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

Finally, service connection is not warranted on a direct basis.  In this regard, even if service connection is not warranted on a presumptive basis, service connection may still be established on a direct basis.  See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  As referenced above, generally in order to establish direct service connection, three elements must be established: (1) a current disability, (2) an in-service event and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the in-service event.  See Shedden, supra.

The August 2024 rating decision on appeal favorably found that the appellant has current diagnoses of peripheral neuropathy, sciatic nerves, of the bilateral lower extremities and that the appellant was exposed to a TERA, exposure to herbicide agents, in service.  The appellant does not contend that his claimed peripheral neuropathy is related to any other in-service event.  Further, the evidence of record does not otherwise reasonably raise any other relevant in-service events related to these claims.  Specifically, the appellant's STRs did not identify any treatment or event related to the disabilities at issue.  In fact, the appellant's January 1969 separation medical examination noted the appellant's neurological system to be normal.  No relevant defects or diagnoses were noted.  On an accompanying separation report of medical history form, the appellant denied experiencing neuritis, neurological difficulties, or paralysis.

The final question in this analysis relates to Shedden element three, medical nexus.  See Shedden, supra.  There is no competent medical evidence supporting a nexus between the appellant's currently diagnosed bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerves to his conceded herbicide exposure or other event in service.  The only medical evidence addressing the question of nexus is the July 2023 VA Peripheral Nerve Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), wherein the appellant was diagnosed with sensory polyneuropathy.  See VA Peripheral Nerve DBQ, July 2, 2024.  The clinician determined that it was not likely that the appellant's peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities was caused by herbicide agent exposure, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA activities.  Id.  The clinician explained that the published research and the appellant's history and physical did not support the claims of peripheral neuropathy being caused by or related to TERA activities involving herbicide agents.  Id.  In support of this determination, the clinician noted that the appellant's STRs were silent for mention of signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy while in service; symptoms began around 2020; and his medical records attribute his peripheral neuropathy to a history of alcohol abuse.  Id.  

A medical opinion is considered adequate when it is based upon consideration of the appellant's prior medical history and examinations and also describes the disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one.  See D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 104 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007) (an adequate medical examination must provide a rationale and explanation for its conclusions).  It is a medical examiner's responsibility to provide a well-supported opinion so that the Board may carry out its duty to weigh the evidence of record.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (concluding that medical opinion is not entitled to any weight "if it contains only data and conclusions").  Here, the VA examiner thoroughly reviewed the appellant's claims file, to include his STRs and his post-service medical treatment records.  The appellant's exposure to herbicide agents was noted, along with the amount of time between his last exposure to herbicide agents and his initial diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities.  This review, in conjunction with analyzing the appellant's prior medical history to include alcohol abuse, provided the foundation upon which the examiner based the negative nexus opinion.  The Board finds this opinion to be thorough and well-supported and assigns significant probative value to it.  It is sufficient upon which to base a determination.  See Nieves-Rodrigues, supra.

The Board acknowledges the appellant's sincere belief that his currently diagnosed peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities is the result of his exposure to herbicide agents during his service in Vietnam.  The evidence of record, however, does not establish that the appellant is competent to provide an opinion as to the etiology of his peripheral neuropathy, to include that such is due to his in-service herbicide agent exposure, as this is a medical issue that would require education, training, or experience to address.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(1), (2); see generally Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

There is no competent evidence of record linking the appellant's peripheral neuropathy to his active service, to include herbicide agent exposure.  As such, the third and final element required for direct service connection, nexus, has not been shown and therefore service connection on a direct basis is not warranted.  See Shedden, supra.

In sum, peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities is not directly related to the appellant's active service, nor may it be presumed to be related thereto.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.302, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Since the evidence is not in an approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
