DOCKET NO. 240828-469553
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran was exposed to loud noises while in service.

2. The Veteran's currently diagnosed tinnitus is related to in-service loud nose exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1154(a), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2006 to April 2007.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus. 

Initially, the Board notes the AOJ, in the September 2023 rating decision, made the following favorable findings: 1) the Veteran has a diagnosis of tinnitus, 2) the claimed disability is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to your military service, 3) noise exposure has been conceded based upon the Veteran's military occupation specialty (MOS), and 4) a nexus or link, has been established between the Veteran's tinnitus and an in-service event or injury based on a July 2023 private medical opinion.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  See AMA, Pub. L. No. 115-55, § 5104A, 131 Stat. 1105, 1106-07.

The Veteran asserts that his tinnitus is the result of in-service noise exposure.  He also reports that his tinnitus began in service and has been recurrent since that time. See September 2003 C&P Examination Report at page 6 (reporting episodes of ringing following shooting weapons on the firing range).

Certain chronic diseases, like tinnitus, will be presumed related to service if they were noted as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if continuity of the same symptomatology has existed since service, with no intervening cause.  38 U.S.C. § § 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307, 3.309(a).

The Board finds that based on the lay and medical evidence of record, service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

The Veteran was afforded a VA hearing loss and tinnitus examination in September 2023.  The Veteran reported that the onset of his tinnitus was during service.  Specifically, he stated that while shooting weapons at the range, he has experienced recurrent episodes of ringing in his ears.  See September 2023 VA examination.  The Veteran stated that the ringing in his ears has worsened over the years.  Id.  The examiner concluded that it was less likely that the Veteran's tinnitus was related to service.  The VA examiner reasoned that there were no reports of tinnitus during service.  The examiner noted that the Veteran reported the onset of his tinnitus to be post separation from service.  

In July 2023, the Veteran's private examiner provided a positive nexus opinion.  The private examiner opined that the Veteran's MOS of Logistics should be conceded.  He reasoned that given the Veteran's MOS, his credible lay statement, and the current medical literature, it is more likely than not that his bilateral tinnitus is due to and/or related to military acoustic trauma during active-duty military service.  See July 2023 private examination report.  

To the extent that a VA examiner rendered a negative direct service connection opinion in September 2023, the Board does not find this negative opinion to persuasively outweigh the July 2023 private positive nexus opinion. The VA examiner's statement that the Veteran reported the onset of tinnitus after service conflicts with the prior page of that report wherein it was documented that the Veteran experienced episodes of ringing in service after shooting weapons on the range.

For these reasons, and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met, and the claim is granted.
