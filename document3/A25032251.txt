ORDER

An evaluation greater than 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus is denied.

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

REMANDED

An initial evaluation more than 10 percent for service-connected left ankle condition is remanded.

Service connection for left foot condition is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's tinnitus manifests ringing in ears.

2. The evidence weighs persuasively against the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

3. The Veteran does not have a bilateral hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial evaluation more than 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.71a, diagnostic code (DC) 6260.

2. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 2019 to September 2023.

In the February 2024 rating decisions, the regional office (RO) granted service connection for tinnitus and left ankle tendonitis with separate 10 percent evaluations and denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and left foot condition.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected a Direct Review.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal was not considered.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for left foot condition and increase rating for left ankle condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claims.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Disability Ratings

Ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.  The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  

The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2009).

When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

1. An evaluation greater than 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus.

The Veteran's service-connected tinnitus is evaluated as 10 percent disabling from September 11, 2023.  The Veteran seeks a higher initial evaluation.  

In September 2023, the Veteran was provided a medical examination confirming reports of ringing in ears since service.  See VA medical examination (September 2023).  Subsequently, in a February 2024 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for the Veteran's tinnitus with a 10 percent rating from September 11, 2023.  Indeed, the Veteran is competent to establish factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005).  Tinnitus is capable of lay observation.  Competent lay evidence is sufficient in and of itself to establish service connection.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d. 1331 (2006).

Here, the probative evidence, to include a VA medical examination, show the Veteran's tinnitus causes ringing in ears.  See VA medical examination (September 2023).  Under DC 6260 a 10 percent rating is assigned for recurrent tinnitus.  Thus, the Veteran's condition and symptoms are identified and adequately contemplated by DC 6260 and therefore is rated under the appropriate DC. Moreover, the Veteran is currently rated at the maximum rating allowed under DC 6260.  See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 336-337 (2015).  Thus, an evaluation more than 10 percent for the Veteran's tinnitus condition is not warranted.

Since the Veteran requests a rating more than the maximum 10 percent rating allowed for tinnitus, the Board assessed whether extraschedular consideration was appropriate.  

Consideration of an extraschedular rating requires a three-step inquiry.  The first question is whether the schedular rating criteria adequately contemplate the veteran's disability picture.  If the schedular evaluation does not contemplate the level of disability and symptomatology shown and is found inadequate, then the second inquiry is whether the exceptional disability picture exhibits other related factors, such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization.  See Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008).  If the veteran's disability picture meets the second inquiry, then the third step is to refer the case to the Director of Compensation Services to determine whether an extraschedular rating is warranted.  See Thun, 22 Vet. App. 111.

In regard to the first element, comparison of the Veteran's symptoms and associated functional impairment does not show that the rating criteria are inadequate to describe the disability picture.  The Veteran's tinnitus is rated under DC 6260.  The record shows complaints and findings of constant ringing in ears.  See VA medical examination (September 2023).  DC 6260 does list all the Veteran's symptoms.  Thus, the probative medical and lay evidence, to include Veteran's statements, VA examination, and treatment records demonstrate that the Veteran's symptoms of ringing in ears is identified and contemplated under the 10 percent rating assigned.  See VA medical examination (September 2023).  Here, the Veteran's tinnitus manifestations are reasonably contemplated by DC 6260.  The threshold issue under Thun is thus not met, and further consideration of an extraschedular rating is not warranted.

For the above reasons, the evidence for and against a rating greater than 10 percent or extraschedular consideration, at any time, is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so.  Rather, the evidence weighs persuasively against claim.  Consequently, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application and an initial evaluation greater than 10 percent is not warranted.  See 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Service connection

In general, service connection may be granted for a disability or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  To prevail on a direct service connection claim, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  

Determinations as to service connection will be based on review of the entire evidence of record, to include all pertinent medical and lay evidence, with due consideration to VA's policy to administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with the facts in each individual case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). 

Certain chronic diseases, including sensorineural hearing loss, are subject to presumptive service connection if manifest to a compensable degree within one year from separation from service even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

2. Service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  VA conceded hazardous noise exposure in service.  

VA may find hearing loss to be a disability only when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels (dB) or greater; when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC test are less than 94 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2023. Testing of the left ear revealed the following puretone thresholds: 15 dB at 500 Hz, 10 dB at 1000 Hz, 5 dB at 2000 Hz, 10 dB at 3000 Hz, and 20 dB at 4000 Hz. Testing of the right ear revealed the following puretone thresholds: 10 dB at 500 Hz, 10 dB at 1000 Hz, 10 dB at 2000 Hz, 15 dB at 3000 Hz, and 15 dB at 4000 Hz. Speech discrimination testing yielded 100 percent speech discrimination in both ears.  See VA medical examination (September 2023).  The September 2023 VA examination is adequate, and the findings constitute highly probative evidence that weighs substantially against the claim.  Although the record includes other VA examinations for bilateral hearing loss, the evidence was filed outside of the evidentiary window for this appeal and cannot be considered at this time.  

While the Veteran credibly reports being exposed to hazardous noise as an Aircraft Armament Systems Journeyman during service, and VA conceded as much, the September 2023 VA examination findings demonstrate that the Veteran's symptoms do not meet the requirements for a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes. See VA form 21-526 (August 2023); Rating decision (February 2024).  

Notwithstanding the credible statements offered by the Veteran regarding hearing loss, the assignment of a disability for hearing impairment is derived by a mechanical application of audiometric evaluation results to the rating schedule.  See Lendenmann, 3 Vet. App. at 349.  

For the above reasons, the evidence for and against the claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so.  Rather, the evidence weights persuasively against the claim. The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application and service connection for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.  See 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

REASONS FOR REMAND

This appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.  Remand by the Board in the AMA is proper for correction of a pre-decisional duty to assist errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

3. An initial evaluation more than 10 percent for service-connected left ankle tendonitis.

The Veteran's left ankle tendonitis condition is evaluated as 10 percent disabling under DC 5271 from September 2023.  The Veteran seek a higher initial evaluation.

The Veteran underwent a left ankle VA examination in November 2023.  See VA medical examination (November 2023).  However, the examiner did not adequately address the pertinent lay and medical evidence of record regarding the severity of the Veteran's left ankle condition.  Moreover, the examiner did not provide an adequate medical opinion assessing the severity, flare ups, active and passive motion, and weight and non-weight bearing problems of the Veteran's left ankle condition, throughout the appeal.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Sharp v. Shulkin,29 Vet. App. 26 (2017); Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  Consequently, as to the issue of an increase evaluation for left ankle condition, the examination is inadequate and provided minimal probative weight.  

The failure to provide an adequate examination and opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand to remedy.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

On remand, the examiner must provide a retrospective medical opinion discussing the severity of the Veteran's service-connected left ankle condition, throughout the appeal.  See Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80, 85-86 (2008).  In doing so, the examiner must fully discuss the medical and lay evidence regarding the symptoms and impairment of the Veteran's service-connected left ankle condition for the appealed period.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020).

4. Service connection for left foot condition.

The Veteran seeks service connection for left foot disability, to include as secondary to service-connected left leg disabilities.  

The medical evidence documents functional impairment with treatment and pain on heel of left foot.  See VA medical treatment record (September 2019).  

A negative nexus opinion was obtained in November 2023.  See VA medical examination (November 2023).  However, the examiner did not sufficiently address the pertinent lay and medical evidence of record regarding the onset, cause, and nature of the Veteran's left foot condition, including any relation to service-connected left leg disabilities.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020).  Additionally, the examiner did not apply the correct standard of proof or support the findings with a full rationale.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  Consequently, the VA opinion is inadequate.  

The failure to provide an adequate examination and opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand to remedy.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

On remand, the examiner must consider all the medical and lay evidence of record to determine the onset, etiology, and nature of the Veteran's left foot disability or functional impairment.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020).  Reliance on a lack of diagnosis or treatment in service is not a basis for a negative etiological opinion and the examiner must discuss with a complete rationale the medical evidence and Veteran's reports of left foot disability and functional impairment.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018). 

Importantly, the examiner must discuss if the Veteran's left foot disability is due to service-connected lumbar and left leg disabilities.  The examiner is reminded that secondary service connection is warranted where a nonservice-connected disability would have been less severe "but-for" a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.  See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule a VA examination to assess the severity of the Veteran's service-connected left ankle disability. 

The examiner must review the entire claims file and this remand.

The examiner shall provide a full, retrospective description of the severity of the left ankle condition and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability, throughout the appeal period.  

The examiner shall identify all functional impairment found to be present in the disability.  

In doing so, the examiner must specifically acknowledge and discuss the Veteran's medical history and competent lay reports regarding the severity of the left ankle condition. 

The examiner shall describe any pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, instability of station, locking, active and passive motion, weight and non-weight bearing problems, and incoordination present for left ankle condition. 

The examiner shall also state whether the examination is taking place during a period of flare-up.  If not, the examiner shall ask the Veteran to describe the flare-ups experienced, including frequency, duration, characteristics, precipitating and alleviating factors, severity and/or extent of functional impairment experienced during a flare-up of symptoms and/or after repeated use over time. 

Based on the Veteran's lay statements and the other evidence of record, the examiner will provide an opinion estimating any additional degrees of limited motion caused by functional loss during a flare-up or after repeated use over time. 

If unable to render a medical opinion, provide a statement as to whether there is any additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.  

If the examiner is unable to provide any requested opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain why this is so.

2. Schedule a VA examination to determine the onset, etiology, and cause of the Veteran's left foot disability or functional impairment.  

The examiner must review the entire claims file and this remand. 

The examiner shall then respond to the following:

(a) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's left foot disability or functional impairment had its onset in, at least in part, in service? Why or why not?

(b) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's left foot disability or functional impairment is related, at least in part, to service? Why or why not?

(c) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's left foot disability or functional impairment is proximately due, at least in part, to service-connected lumbar and left leg orthopedic conditions and medications? Why or why not?

(d) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the Veteran's left foot disability or functional impairment is aggravated, at least in part, by service-connected lumbar and left leg orthopedic conditions and medications? Why or why not?

Separate opinions addressing causation and aggravation are required for the claimed condition.  

The examiner must acknowledge and discuss the medical and competent lay reports regarding the etiology, onset, nature, and cause of any left foot problems.  A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  

The examiner must apply the "but-for" analysis required to determine entitlement to secondary service connection.  

If unable to render a medical opinion, provide a statement as to whether there is any additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.  

If the examiner is unable to provide any requested opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain why this is so.
