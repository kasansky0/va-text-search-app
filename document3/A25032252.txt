ORDER

The VA Form 21-0958 received August 22, 2019, was a valid Notice of Disagreement.

FINDING OF FACT

The VA Form 21-0958 received August 22, 2019, was received within one year of the date the Veteran was notified of an August 2018 rating decision and clearly identified the benefit sought on appeal. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The VA Form 21-0958 received August 22, 2019, was a valid Notice of Disagreement. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.7, 19.20, 19.21, 19.52.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This is one of two contemporaneous decisions ultimately arising from an August 2018 rating decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) that implemented a Board of Veterans' Appeals decision granting service connection for status post oropharyngeal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue.

In August 2018 the AOJ, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision executing a June 2018 Board grant of service connection for oropharyngeal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue (claimed as throat cancer). The AOJ assigned an initial rating of 100 percent, effective March 31, 2013 (the date the claim of service connection was received), and also found that basic eligibility to Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA) had been established from March 31, 2013. 

In August 2019 the Veteran filed a Legacy Notice of Disagreement (Legacy NOD). In his Legacy NOD, the Veteran contended that he was entitled to additional compensation. Specifically, he asserted that the AOJ had erred by failing to address the issue of entitlement to Special Monthly Compensation based on Aid and Attendance under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) (SMC- A&A). In April 2020 the AOJ advised the Veteran that it did not consider his August 2019 Legacy NOD to be a valid appeal of the August 2018 rating decision, as the issue of entitlement to SMC- A&A had not been adjudicated at all, and thus could not be appealed. As discussed further below, the Board finds this conclusion to have been in error, and that the August 2019 Legacy NOD was a valid appeal of the August 2018 rating decision. 

In May 2020 the Veteran sought Higher Level Review (HLR) of the April 2020 determination under the modernized appeal system (AMA). Also in May 2020, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for lung cancer. 

In a September 2020 HLR decision the AOJ maintained its determination that the August 2019 Legacy NOD had not been a valid appeal, as the issue of entitlement to SMC - A&A had not been adjudicated in the August 2018 rating decision, and thus could not be appealed. In October 2020 VA received a VA Form 10182 seeking review of the September 2020 Higher Level Review (HLR) decision. The record reflects that the October 2020 filing was docketed as an AMA appeal (06/30/2021, BVA Letter). 

While the October 2020 appeal was pending, in December 2020 the AOJ granted the May 2020 claim of service connection for lung cancer and, in addition to rating that disability, awarded SMC- A&A effective April 6, 2020. 

In February 2021 VA received notice that the Veteran had died on February [REDACTED] 2021. The appellant, Veteran's surviving spouse, requested to substitute in April 2021 and her request was granted later that same month.

In March 2022 the appellant filed a VA Form 10182 seeking an earlier effective date for the May 2020 grant of SMC - A&A. In March 2022 the appellant was advised that her March 2022 AMA NOD was not considered timely. In March 2024, under the instant docket number, the Board upheld the finding that the March 2022 AMA NOD was not timely. The appellant appealed this issue to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC). In October 2024 CAVC, pursuant to the terms of a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) by the appellant and VA, vacated the March 2024 Board decision and remanded the issue to the Board for readjudication. The matter of the timeliness of the March 2022 VA Form 10182 is addressed by the Board in a separate decision under an appropriate AMA docket number. 

The subject of the instant Board decision is whether the August 2019 Legacy NOD was a valid appeal of the August 2018 rating decision. As discussed further below, the Board finds that the August 2019 Legacy NOD was a valid appeal. Accordingly, the Veteran's August 2019 appeal of the August 2018 rating decision is properly adjudicated under the Legacy system and will be so adjudicated in a separate decision under an appropriate Legacy docket number. 

1. VA Form 21-0958 received August 22, 2019, was a valid Notice of Disagreement

As discussed above, in August 2018 the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for status post oropharyngeal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue. The AOJ assigned a disability rating of 100 percent, effective March 31, 2013 (the date VA received the claim of service connection). The Veteran was notified of this decision by correspondence dated September 1, 2018. 

In August 2019 VA received a VA Form 21-0958 (Notice of Disagreement) in which the Veteran, through his representative, sought to appeal the August 2018 rating decision "insofar as VA did not grant [SMC - A&A]." 08/22/2019, NOD. VA advised the Veteran in April 2020 that his appeal was not considered valid, as the issue of entitlement to SMC - A&A had not been adjudicated in the August 2018 rating decision. 04/06/2020, Appeal Notification Letter. In a September 2020 HLR the AOJ maintained that the August 2019 NOD was invalid as the issue of entitlement to SMC - A&A had not been adjudicated in the August 2018 rating decision, and there could be no appeal of an unadjudicated issue. In October 2020 the Veteran submitted a VA 10182 seeking review of the May 2020 HLR decision on the validity of the attempted August 2019 appeal. 

The Board hereby finds that the August 2019 Legacy NOD was a valid appeal of the August 2018 rating decision. 

Under the Legacy appeals regulations, an appeal consists of a timely filed VA Form 21-0958 that clearly identifies the issue sought to be appealed. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.20 - 19.21. The Board notes that the August 2019 Legacy NOD was timely. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52.

A claim for SMC is considered part and parcel of a claim for increased rating. Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118 (1991). The August 2018 rating decision assigned an initial rating for the service connected status post oropharyngeal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue. The Veteran sought a higher initial rating (specifically in the form of SMC - A&A). To find that the matter of entitlement to SMC - A&A would have had to have been expressly adjudicated in August 2018 in order for the Veteran to seek it as an ancillary benefit as part of an appeal of an initial rating would be contrary to the holding in Akles and would deprive the Veteran of the right to one review on appeal under 38 U.S.C. § 7105. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the August 2019 Legacy NOD was a valid appeal of the August 2018 rating decision. As discussed above, the underlying claim of entitlement to a higher initial rating for status post oropharyngeal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue, to include entitlement to SMC - A&A, is properly adjudicated under the Legacy system, and will be so adjudicated in a separate decision under an appropriate Legacy docket number.
