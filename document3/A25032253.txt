ORDER

Entitlement to a rating of 30 percent for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the period on review, the Veteran's BPPV was manifested by dizziness and occasional staggering. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a 30 percent rating for BPPV have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.59, 4.87, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1984 to August 2007. 

The first rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2023 decision.  In September 2023, the AOJ issued a HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2023 decision.  

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for BPPV most recently addressed in the September 2023 HLR decision.  In March 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 decision on appeal.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Other than what is discussed below, the Veteran has not raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board . . . to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to duty-to-assist argument).

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for BPPV

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for BPPV prior to his retirement from the military, and in February 2008 he was granted service connection for BPPV, rated as 10 percent disabling, effective September 1, 2007. In February 2023, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim for BPPV. In May 2023, the AOJ continued the 10 percent rating for BPPV. The Veteran filed a request for HLR, and in September 2023 the AOJ continued the 10 percent rating for BPPV. The Veteran filed a supplemental claim and in March 2024 the AOJ continued the 10 percent rating for BPPV. The Veteran disagreed with the rating and perfected this appeal of the May 2023 and March 2024 decisions. He contends that the assigned rating does not adequately reflect the severity of his disability. The period for review is from February 2023 to March 2024. 

A disability rating is determined by applying VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. The Board may consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time-a practice known as "staged ratings,"- whether or not the claim concerns an initial rating. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). Where the rating criteria for a disability do not explicitly consider the ameliorative effects of medication, the Board may not consider those effects in assigning a disability rating. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 61 (2012).

The Veteran's service-connected BPPV is currently evaluated as 10 percent disabling under DC 6204. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87. Under DC 6204, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for occasional dizziness, and a maximum 30 percent disability rating is warranted for dizziness and occasional staggering. A Note to the code states that objective findings supporting the diagnosis of vestibular disequilibrium are required before a compensable evaluation can be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87.

Dizziness is defined as "a disturbed sense of relationship to space; a sensation of unsteadiness with a feeling of movement within the head." See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary at 559 (32nd ed. 2012). The term "stagger" is not defined in the Rating Schedule, but is generally defined as "a reeling or unsteady gait or stance." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1214 (11th ed. 2003).

The AOJ's rating decisions continued the 10 percent rating for BPPV based on his occasional dizziness, finding that the evidence did not show "occasional staggering" as required for a 30 percent rating under DC 6204. 

The Veteran submitted a statement in August 2023 describing his BPPV symptoms:

After my last bout of vertigo I really thought that I would have to quit working. I still have trouble walking normally and constantly have to find a wall or some other thing that I may use to help keep from falling. I went through over a year of vestibular rehab so that they could retrain my brain, I did notice some relief but still have things that are really bothersome and often embarrassing. Not only has this affected my balance but has caused some vision problems as well . . . . [BPPV] has drastically altered my everyday living as tripping or weaving when just trying to walk has become a[n] everyday ordeal.

The Veteran also submitted a statement from his wife in August 2023, describing the Veteran's BPPV:

My husband . . . went through another episode of his vertigo about 2 years ago. This occurrence was the worst I have seen, not only did this cause him to have nausea and constant vomiting, there was also the times where he could not walk a straight line without the assistance of friends or family members. Many times he bumped into things and lost his balance, not only in our home but when out in public as well.

He spent over a year having to go to Vestibular Rehabilitation every week to try and cope with his condition. He has changed dramatically since this last occurrence, he often tells us that it is residual left overs from the vertigo.

A VA primary care physician note from November 13, 2023, noted the Veteran's BPPV was "chronic, intermittent, improving," with "some residual symptoms." The Veteran denied having fallen, but noted "some stumbles" that he believed were due to the BPPV.

The Veteran's VA treatment notes show that he was previously prescribed Meclizine to help his BPPV symptoms. His Meclizine prescription is noted in treatment notes from October 2007 to January 2020. The most recent mention of Meclizine is a primary care note dated January 24, 2020, which noted that Meclizine provided the Veteran with "some relief." There is no specific mention that Meclizine was discontinued, but it no longer appeared in the Veteran's lists of active medications beginning in October 2020. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2023. The VA examiner, Dr. D.E., noted that the Veteran had been diagnosed with BPPV in 2004, with the following history:

Veteran has acute onset of vertigo while at work in the service, he was unable to stand with dizziness, lasted for 5-10 minutes.  It happened a couple more times while in service.  It resolved for years then returned in 2021 and he had another severe episode.  He again had dizziness and could not focus.  This time lasted longer, 30 minutes. He then was seen at the VA. He has minor episodes now of feeling off balance.

Dr. D.E. noted that the progress of the Veteran's BPPV had "stayed the same" since its onset, with the Veteran currently experiencing "recurrent vertigo occurring 1x every 2 months and lasting 30 minutes." The Veteran reported having had vestibular therapy, and taking no medication for BPPV. Dr. D.E. noted that the Veteran suffers from vertigo less than once a month, lasting less than one hour, and did not indicate that his symptoms include staggering. Regarding the functional impact of BPPV, Dr. D.E. noted that the "Veteran would not be safe to work at heights or with heavy machinery. He should limit driving."

Based on the Veteran's VA treatment notes not mentioning him taking Meclizine since January 2020, as well as Dr. D.E. noting that the Veteran does not take medication for his BPPV, the Board finds that the Veteran's BPPV symptoms as reflected in the evidence throughout the period on review do not include the effects of medication, and there is no need for the Board to discount any ameliorative effects of medication.

The question at issue is whether the Veteran experiences "occasional staggering" as required for a 30 percent rating under DC 6204. 

As noted above, the dictionary definition of staggering is "a reeling or unsteady gait or stance." Although Dr. D.E. did not note that the Veteran experiences staggering, she did state that the Veteran reported that his BPPV episodes cause him to be "unable to stand," which would certainly constitute unsteady stance within the definition of staggering. Additionally, the Veteran's August 2023 statement reflects that he "still ha[s] trouble walking normally and constantly ha[s] to find a wall . . . [to] use to keep from falling," as well as "tripping or weaving when just trying to walk." His VA treatment medical records additionally include his report to his primary care physician that he had experienced stumbling which he believed was due to the BPPV. These clearly show occasional unsteadiness in gait or stance.

Therefore, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence of record reflects that throughout the appeal period the Veteran has experienced occasional staggering as well as dizziness due to his BPPV, and so a 30 percent rating under DC 6204 is warranted for the entire appeal period. This is the maximum schedular evaluation available under DC 6204.
