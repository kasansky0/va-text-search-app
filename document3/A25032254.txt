FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's left knee manifestations began during and have continued since service (being diagnosed post-service as arthritis) and were at least as likely as not caused by in-service injury.

2. The probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's lumbar spine manifestations began during and have continued since service (being diagnosed post-service as arthritis) and were at least as likely as not caused by in-service injury.

3. The probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's LLE paresthesia is secondary to his lumbar spine degenerative arthritis.

4. The probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's RLE paresthesia is secondary to his lumbar spine degenerative arthritis.

5. The probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's right shoulder manifestations began during and have continued since service (being diagnosed post-service as arthritis) and were at least as likely as not caused by in-service injury.

6. The probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's left elbow manifestations began during and have continued since service (being diagnosed post-service as arthritis) and were at least as likely as not caused by in-service injury.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1968 to May 1970.  The Board thanks the Veteran for his service to our country.

On April 13, 2023, VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ initiating the claims herein.  In a January 24, 2024, Rating Decision (on appeal), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claims herein.  On May 9, 2024, VA received a VA Form 10182, in which the Veteran elected the Board's review of the claims herein under the Hearing Request Docket pursuant to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  38?C.F.R. §?20.301.  A Board hearing was scheduled for August 8, 2024; however, that hearing was cancelled after the Veteran submitted an August 5, 2024, Correspondence, withdrawing his hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.704(e).  Further, on January 30, 2025, VA received the Veteran's response to a January 6, 2025, docket switch waiver request letter; the Veteran elected to waive his right to a different Board review option.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).

Applicable Review Periods and Evidentiary Windows

The review period and the evidentiary window are distinct concepts in AMA that are not interchangeable (the review period is limited to the period considered by the AOJ [i.e., ends at the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal]; the evidentiary window is the time which evidence may be submitted and considered for the issue on appeal).  The Hearing Request Docket only permits the Board to review the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision(s) on appeal as well as any evidence submitted at the hearing (including the testimony) and within 90 days after the hearing.  38?C.F.R. §?19.2(d).  If the hearing request is withdrawn pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.704(e), the Board's decision will be based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's decision(s) on the issue(s) on appeal and evidence submitted within 90 days following receipt of the hearing withdrawal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  If additional evidence was submitted between the date of the AOJ decision(s) on appeal and the date the hearing request was withdrawn, the Board will not consider it unless it is resubmitted during the 90 days following receipt of the hearing withdrawal request. ?Id; Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).? 

Regarding the appeal herein, the review periods for all claims span from the date of the claims (April 13, 2023) through the date the AOJ issued the decision on appeal (January 24, 2024); the evidentiary windows for all claims are limited to evidence associated with the claims file on or before the date the AOJ issued the decision on appeal (January 24, 2024) and submitted within 90 days following VA's receipt of the hearing withdrawal (within 90 days from August 5, 2024).  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. §?3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  Cook, supra.  However, regarding the claim remanded herein, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Under the AMA, the reasons for remand are limited to: (a) correction of pre-decisional, duty-to-assist errors; and (b) correction of an AOJ error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).  Following correction of the error, the AOJ must readjudicate the issue.  Pub. L. No. 115-55, § 2(d)(2); 38?C.F.R. §?3.2502.  A claimant may choose to file a new appeal to the Board from such readjudication or request higher-level review or a supplemental claim with the AOJ.

Direct service connection may be warranted if the evidence shows: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Although a competent medical opinion is generally required to establish etiology, competent and credible lay evidence of chronicity and continuity of symptomology may also establish etiology.  38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b); Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465?(1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372?(Fed. Cir. 2007).  Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d); Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043?(Fed. Cir. 1994). 

Secondary service connection may be warranted for a current disability that is either proximately caused by or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. §?3.310(a), (b); Allen v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?439 (1995).  A "permanent worsening" of a non-service-connected disability is not required to establish secondary service connection based on aggravation (i.e., aggravation may include temporary worsening of a disability).  Ward v. Wilkie, 31?Vet. App.?233 (2019).  Secondary service connection may also be warranted where a nonservice-connected disability would have been less severe but-for a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the nonservice-connected disability.  Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023). 

When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a Veteran's disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki,?24?Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau,?supra.  In this case, the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran has the medical background necessary to opine regarding symptoms or diagnoses that are not lay observable; however, as a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report lay-observable symptoms and functional loss because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses.  Layno,?supra.  Lay evidence may establish a diagnosis of a simple medical condition, a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or symptoms that later support a diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau, supra.

The Veteran generally contends that his left knee, lumbar spine, right shoulder, and left elbow manifestations (diagnosed post-separation as arthritis) began during and have continued since service and are etiologically related to in-service injury; the Veteran further contends that his bilateral lower extremity neurological symptoms are secondary to his lumbar spine condition.  See April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; November 2024 Brief.  Service treatment records did not document pertinent abnormalities upon entrance to service (see March 1968 pre-induction examination); however, they documented the Veteran's report of knee problems and the provider's note of swelling on the right upon separation (see April 1970 separation examination).  Although service treatment records did not document left knee, back, right shoulder, or left elbow symptoms, treatment, or diagnoses, the Board finds the Veteran's reports of ongoing manifestations since service to be probative because the Veteran is competent to report his lay-observable symptoms and functional loss, his reports are credible given his in-service duties, and his reports have remained longitudinally consistent throughout the record.  See April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; November 2024 Brief; Layno,?supra;?Jandreau,?supra. 

Crucially, the Veteran has competently and consistently contended that his lay-observable manifestations began during and have continued since service; as noted above, the Board finds the Veteran's reports of in-service injury and continuity of symptomology since service to be probative.  Id.  The AOJ did not afford the Veteran VA examinations in connection with these claims; nevertheless, the Board finds that remand for further medical development is not warranted because, as discussed above, there is no indication that the Veteran had pertinent problems prior to service, injury during service has been conceded, and the Veteran provided probative reports of lay-observable manifestations since service that were subsequently attributed to the arthritis diagnoses herein.  See February 11, 2011, private record (after imaging and examination, the provider determined that the Veteran's back symptoms were consistent with degenerative arthritis); November 3, 2011, private record (after imaging and examination, the provider determined that the Veteran's right shoulder and left elbow symptoms were consistent with degenerative arthritis in the acromioclavicular joint and osteoarthritis in the left elbow); September 7, 2012, private record (after imaging and examination, the provider determined that the Veteran's knee symptoms were consistent with significant osteoarthritis); Jandreau, supra; Layno, supra.  Accordingly, the probative lay statements regarding continuity of symptomatology since service, coupled with post-separation providers attributing that continuing symptomatology to the arthritis diagnoses herein, are sufficient to establish nexuses between the in-service injury and the claimed disabilities.  Thus, the Board grants the left knee, lumbar spine, right shoulder, and left elbow claims on direct bases, resolving them in full.  Lastly, probative evidence medically attributes the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity paresthesia to his lumbar spine degenerative arthritis (see March 2, 2022 private record); thus, the Board grants the LLE and RLE paresthesia claims on secondary bases, resolving them in full (the Board finds it is unnecessary to address any other theory of service connection for the LLE and RLE paresthesia claims because they would award no greater benefits to the Veteran than an award based on secondary service connection in this appeal and, as such, no prejudice results).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition

The Veteran generally contends that his acquired psychiatric disorder was caused by in-service trauma and that his manifestations have persisted since service.? See April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; June 2023 VA Form 21-0781; November 2024 Brief.  Despite the January 2024 Rating Decision adjudicating multiple claims related to mental health, the Board notes that all mental health diagnoses are collectively construed as a single claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.? Clemons v. Shinseki, 23?Vet. App.?1 (2009) (the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may be reasonably encompassed by the claimant's description of the disability, reported symptoms, and other information of record).

In the April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran contended that this disability was caused by losing colleagues and experiencing combat alerts in 1968.  In the June 2023 VA Form 21-0781, the Veteran reported additional stressors: (a) witnessing a fellow servicemember get electrocuted while he was assigned to an engineer battalion; and (b) getting harassed about his fear of snakes by other soldiers in his platoon, resulting in a sergeant punishing the other soldiers.  In August 7, 2023, and November 16, 2023, Subsequent Development Letters, the AOJ asked the Veteran to provide more details about his reported stressors (including the unit assignment during the electrocution incident and the dates of unit assignment) and explained that the information already submitted did not meet the minimum level of detail needed for VA to seek corroboration assistance; however, the Veteran did not respond to those letters.  Accordingly, in the January 2024 Rating Decision, the AOJ noted that it could not confirm the reported stressors.  

Crucially, the Veteran's Military Personnel Records (of record at the time of the Rating Decision on appeal) contained some of the additional information requested by the August 7, 2023, Subsequent Development Letter for seeking corroboration assistance.  Specifically, the Veteran reported that the electrocution incident occurred while he was assigned to an engineer battalion and his Military Personnel Records document assignment to "HHC, 13th EngrBn, 7thInfDiv, USARPAC" from December 13, 1968, through May 15, 1970.  It is unclear whether the AOJ considered that additional information when analyzing whether the total information met the minimum level of detail needed for VA to seek corroboration assistance (to the contrary, asking for the Veteran to provide that information indicates that the AOJ was not aware that the information was already of record).  As such, the Board finds that the AOJ committed a pre-decisional, duty-to-assist error by inadequately considering whether it could seek stressor corroboration assistance, the results of which could favorably impact the Veteran's claim.  Although the Board has carefully considered whether remand could be avoided, the evidence of record is insufficient to decide the claim; thus, remand is warranted.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Determine whether the total information of record meets the minimum level of detail needed to seek stressor corroboration assistance from the U.S. Army Office for Unit Records Research (or similar repository).

The AOJ must consider, but is not limited to:

(a)	the Veteran's reported stressors (in the April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran contended that this disability was caused by losing colleagues and experiencing combat alerts in 1968; in the June 2023 VA Form 21-0781, the Veteran reported additional stressors of (i) witnessing a fellow servicemember get electrocuted while he was assigned to an engineer battalion and (ii) getting harassed about his fear of snakes by other soldiers in his platoon, resulting in a sergeant punishing the other soldiers);

(b)	August 7, 2023, Subsequent Development Letter (the AOJ asked the Veteran to provide more details about his reported stressors, including the unit assignment during the electrocution incident and the dates of unit assignment, and explained that the information already submitted did not meet the minimum level of detail needed for VA to seek corroboration assistance); and

(c)	Military Personnel Records (documented assignment to "HHC, 13th EngrBn, 7thInfDiv, USARPAC" from December 13, 1968, through May 15, 1970).
