DOCKET NO. 240819-498808
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment of beneficiary travel mileage expenses associated with travel to a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facility on August 7, 2024, is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran travelled to a non-VA medical facility on August 7, 2024, based on pre-authorized care.  Resolving doubt in his favor, the appointment did not take place through no fault of his own; instead, the failure to obtain the care or services was due to actions by persons acting on behalf of VA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to payment of beneficiary travel mileage expenses associated with travel to a non-VA medical facility on August 7, 2024, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 111, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 70.4, 70.10, 70.20 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1967 to May 1970.

The decision on appeal was issued in August 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In his August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to payment of beneficiary travel mileage expenses associated with travel to a non-VA medical facility on August 7, 2024

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to payment or reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses for travel to a non-VA appointment on August 7, 2024, that was ultimately cancelled due to his refusal to sign documents that could make him financially responsible for the treatment provided.  See August 2024 statement.  

Generally, payment or reimbursement for beneficiary travel may be authorized under 38 C.F.R. §§ 70.1-70.50. 38 U.S.C. § 111. VA will approve payment for beneficiary travel if the travel was made to obtain care or services for a person who is eligible for beneficiary travel payments under 38 C.F.R. § 70.10. Eligible persons include veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more who travel to or from a VA facility or VA-authorized health care facility for examination, treatment, or care for any condition. 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a)(2).

VA will approve payment for beneficiary travel if: (1) the travel was made to obtain care or services for a person who is eligible for beneficiary travel payments under § 70.10; (2) the travel was in conjunction with care or services for which such person was eligible under the laws administered by VA; (3) application was made in accordance with § 70.20; (4) all the requirements of this part for payment are made; and (5) any failure to obtain the care or services was due to actions by officials of VA or persons acting on behalf of VA. 38 C.F.R. § 70.4.

In this case, the Veteran is service connected for several disabilities and meets the basic requirement for VA beneficiary travel benefits as he had a disability rated at least 30 percent at the time of his appointment. 38 U.S.C. § 111; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a).

The Veteran was approved for chiropractic care with a non-VA provider.  He arrived for his August 7, 2024, appointment with the non-VA provider and was asked to complete several financial forms that would make him responsible for discretionary medical services provided and would hold him financially responsible for any services provided that were not paid by VA.  He refused to sign the financial documents, and the non-VA provider cancelled his appointment.

In an undated letter (received on August 19, 2024), the non-VA provider stated that the Veteran "arrived at his appointment but did not stay for the appointment" because he "did not want to fill out paperwork consenting that he would be financially responsible for any treatment that was not covered by the VA."  This undated correspondence confirms the Veteran's version of why the appointment was not completed and shows that it was ultimately through no fault of his own. 

In the August 2024 letter denying reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses incurred on August 7, 2024, the AOJ gave the following reason for the denial: "The appointment associated with this claim is marked as not completed. Since the appointment is more than 2 days in the past the claim needs to be looked at manually to determine if any payment is due or whether the claim should be denied."  The decision letter, on its face, indicates that the AOJ had not fully completed processing of the Veteran's claim, and that a final determination still needed to be made, after consideration of the evidence, as to whether the Veteran's reimbursement claim should be granted.

The Board considered a remand to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error to provide adequate notice of the decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. However, upon review, the Board finds that there is adequate evidence of record to adjudicate the matter. There is no question that the Veteran met the requirements for mileage reimbursement related to his August 7, 2024, date of treatment.  There is also no question that the Veteran's appointment was cancelled by the provider when he refused to sign financial documents that could make him financially liable for treatment that was covered by VA.  There is also no question that his request for reimbursement was timely filed.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the record is in at least equipoise as to whether the August 7, 2024, VA scheduled appointment is entitled to payment or reimbursement for round-trip beneficiary travel expenses. The appointment was not completed because of the Veteran's refusal to sign certain financial documents from a non-VA provider who VA contracted with to provide such services (and who was provided with the means and mechanisms to seek approval from VA for services outside of the initial agreement).  The Veteran's failure to obtain care was due solely to the actions of the non-VA provider who attempted to force the Veteran to sign documents that would make him financially responsible when care was covered by VA. Thus, in resolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board concludes that payment or reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses for roundtrip travel from the Veteran's home to the non-VA facility on August 7, 2024, is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 70.4(a)(5).
