DOCKET NO. 240620-449375
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for migraines including migraine variants has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

In an October 2024 written correspondence, prior to the promulgation of a decision in this matter, the Veteran explicitly and unambiguously stated that he wished to withdraw his appeal as to his claims of entitlement to increased ratings for migraines.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal regarding the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for migraines including migraine variants by the Veteran (or his authorized representative) have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from November 1988 to September 1996 and August 2017 to March 2018.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).  The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 for a supplemental claim in March 2024 after a March 2024 denied his claim.  The RO issued a rating decision in May 2024, which found clear and unmistakable error in the evaluation of the Veteran's migraine and increased the rating to 50 percent.  The Veteran timely appealed the rating decision by submitting a VA Form 10182 and requested the hearing docket, which allows the submission of additional evidence within 90-days after a hearing is held pursuant to the Veterans Appeals Improvement Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA).  38 C.F.R. § 20.303 (2019).  

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for migraines including migraine variants has been withdrawn and is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 19.55, 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.

Here, in an October 2024 written statement, prior to the promulgation of a Board decision with respect to this matter, the Veteran stated that he wished to withdraw his appeal as to his claim of entitlement to increased ratings for migraines.  The statement satisfied the requirements to withdraw his appeal.  See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2020).  As such, there remains no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration in regard to this issue.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal as to this issue, and it is dismissed.
