DOCKET NO. 240802-460878
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbances is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time the Veteran filed his August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), a prior supplemental claim as to the issues of sleep apnea and sleep disturbances was pending final adjudication before the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

2. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbances have been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2013 to January 2018.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by an AOJ.

In the August 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected to appeal the issues listed above and requested a direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ. 

Dismissal

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.

2. Entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbances.

Historically, the above-mentioned April 2024 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea and sleep disturbances. In July 2024, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claims. While this supplemental claim was pending adjudication, he submitted the Notice of Disagreement on August 2, 2024, and identified the issues listed above. 

Under the modernized review system, a claimant may take any of the following actions within one year from the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision on a claim: File a request for HLR, file a supplemental claim, or file a notice of disagreement (Board appeal). 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a). Once a claimant takes one of the above actions, the claimant may not take another action with respect to the same claim or same issue contained within the claim until the HLR, supplemental claim, or notice of disagreement is adjudicated or withdrawn. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

The Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 20-0995 was clearly received within one year of the April 2024 rating decision, and prior to the August 2024 VA Notice of Disagreement. The record does not show that the Veteran withdrew his request for the supplemental claim lane. Instead, the AOJ adjudicated this supplemental claim in an August 2024 rating decision. Therefore, as the Veteran elected the supplemental claim lane for the denial of his claims, the same issue may not also be addressed by the Board at this time.

As 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b) prohibits claimants from pursuing two concurrent lanes of administrative review for the same "claim or [] issue," the claims to readjudicate entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea and sleep disturbances are dismissed.

Lastly, the Board is cognizant of Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021). In Hall, the Court reversed a Board decision that had dismissed an appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the veteran's notice of disagreement was filed on the wrong form. Here, the Court held that "[t]he particular form a claimant submits-correct or otherwise-has no bearing on the Board's jurisdiction to hear an appeal. Although VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings in appropriate circumstances, none of this affects the Board's jurisdiction to hear appeals of veterans benefits decisions."

In Hall, the Court pointed to 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a) and 7104(a), and noted that neither indicated that Congress had sought to eliminate VA's authority to adjudicate veterans' benefits disputes, i.e., its subject matter jurisdiction, when a claimant's pleading failed to conform to form requirements. Consequently, pursuant to Hall, while the Board is precluded from dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, it may, however, dismiss an appeal based on a non-jurisdictional procedural defect. Such is the case here. 

Although this appeal was docketed by the Board, the Veteran was advised in an August 2024 letter that it is possible that upon a more detailed review, the Board could determine that the appeal did not meet the necessary procedural requirements. The Veteran was informed that if the Board identifies such a defect, it may issue a decision dismissing the appeal. 

As discussed above, concurrent elections for review are prohibited. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). As the Veteran elected the supplemental claim lane of the denial of his claims, the Board is precluded from addressing the claims at this time. Thus, the Board concludes that dismissal is warranted due to non-jurisdictional procedural defect. See Hall, 34 Vet. App. 329. See also 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.201, 20.202. 

Finally, although this appeal is being dismissed, the appeal period for the August 2024 rating decision, which adjudicated the same issues, has not yet expired. The Veteran may still appeal this decision to the Board.
