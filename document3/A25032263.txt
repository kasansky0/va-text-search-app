ORDER

Service connection for chronic arthritis left hip is denied. 

Service connection for chronic arthritis right hips is denied. 

Service connection for dizziness w/sporadic staggering and falls, to include as secondary to the service-connected tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the left hip disability began during active service, manifested in the first post-service year, or is otherwise related to service.

2. The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the right hip disability began during active service, manifested in the first post-service year, or is otherwise related to service.

3. The Veteran's vertigo is proximately due to his service-connected tinnitus.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left hip arthritis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 3.307. 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right hip arthritis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 3.307. 3.309.

3. The criteria for service connection for vertigo secondary to service-connected tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1955 to September 1959.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from April 2024 and October 2024 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In November 2024 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement, requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge. Therefore, the Board will consider only the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

This matter has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

The Veteran waived his right to any additional time within which to modify the chosen Board appeal lane. See 38 C.F.R. §20.202(c) (2024); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. Ano. 305 (2024).

The Board notes the Veteran has submitted evidence consisting of private medical treatment records outside of the evidentiary window. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§1110, 1131; 38C.F.R. §3.303. "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"-the so-called "nexus requirement." Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

Service connection for certain chronic diseases may be presumed to have been incurred in service by showing that the disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year (three years for active tuberculous disease and Hansen's disease; seven years for multiple sclerosis) from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). Such a chronic disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even though there is no evidence of that disease during the period of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a).

The term "chronic disease" refers to those diseases listed under section 1101(3) of the statute and section 3.309(a) of VA regulations. 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013). For such diseases, the second and third elements of service connection may be established by demonstrating (1) that a condition was "noted" during service; (2) post-service continuity of symptoms; and (3) medical, or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a link between the present disability and the continuity of symptoms. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see Walker, 708 F.3d at 1340. If a chronic condition is noted during service or during the presumptive period, but the chronic condition is not "shown to be chronic, or where the diagnosis of the chronicity may be legitimately questioned," i.e., "when the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported," then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required to support a claim for disability compensation for the chronic disease. Proven continuity of symptomatology establishes the link, or nexus, between the current disease and serves as the evidentiary tool to confirm the existence of the chronic disease while in service or a presumptive period during which existence in service is presumed." Id. at 1336; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

The standard of proof to be applied in decisions on claims for VA benefits is set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). Under that provision, VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Service connection for chronic arthritis left hip 

2. Service connection for chronic arthritis right hips 

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hip chronic arthritis. 

In the April 2024 rating decision on appeal the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with bilateral hip osteoarthritis. The Board is bound by that finding absent clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for complaint, treatment, or diagnosis of a hip condition while in service. 

The Board finds that service connection for bilateral hip disabilities is not warranted. The Board finds no credible evidence of an in-service event that caused his bilateral hip disabilities. The service treatment records do not document any injury to the hips. Additionally, beyond the bare assertion of service connection, the Veteran has not put forth any statements or other evidence of an in-service event that precipitated his claimed bilateral hip arthritis. 

Further, there is no evidence that the Veteran's arthritis began within one year of his service or was noted in-service. Specifically, the Veteran was first diagnosed with hip arthritis in August 2022, which is more than a year after he separated from service. Therefore, presumptive service connection is not warranted.

The Veteran was not provided an examination as part of this claim. VA must provide a VA medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for VA to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). Here, there is no competent evidence of a current disability or statements showing persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability. Therefore, the failure to provide an examination was not a breach of VA's pre-decisional duty to assist.

Finally, the Board finds that a medical opinion addressing toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) is not necessary to adjudicate this issue. The evidence shows the claimed disability is a physical trauma, and the Secretary has determined there is no indication of association between this condition and participation in a TERA. There is also no competent medical or scientific evidence of an association between the claimed disability and in-service TERA. Therefore, a medical opinion addressing toxic exposures is not necessary to adjudicate this issue. 38 U.S.C. § 1168.

In this case, the persuasive evidence is against finding that the Veteran's bilateral hip chronic arthritis is related to his active service. The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is therefore not for application, and the claim for service connection for bilateral hip chronic arthritis must be denied.

3. Service connection for dizziness w/sporadic staggering and falls 

The Veteran seeks service connection for dizziness with sporadic staggering and falls, to include as secondary to his service-connected disabilities. 

In the October 2024 rating decision on appeal the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with dizziness. The Board is bound by that finding absent clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran's STRs are silent for any complaint, treatment, or diagnosis of vertigo or dizziness.

In February 2024 the Veteran underwent a VA examination. The Veteran reported he started having trouble getting out of the bunks at the barracks while on active duty and would have to steady himself. His wife reported he has had vertigo "forever". The examiner noted the Veteran had a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The examination report indicated the Veteran had vestibular symptoms of episodes of tinnitus and vertigo more than once per week. The Veteran's gait was noted as unsteady. The examiner opined that the Veteran's benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was at least as likely as not related to his service. The examiner explained that medical literature supported a finding that because the vertigo began subsequent to tinnitus it was the direct result of the tinnitus. 

In June 2024 the Veteran submitted an article explaining that vertigo can be related to tinnitus because both are conditions that originate from the inner ear.  

The Veteran submitted a private medical opinion in June 2024. The private physician opined that the Veteran's vertigo was more likely than not caused by his service because he had no known risk factors for vertigo. The Board finds this opinion inadequate because there is no additional rationale provided for the opinion, which is otherwise conclusory. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").

The Veteran underwent a second VA examination in July 2024. The Veteran reported vertigo symptoms with head spinning. He used a cane and wheeled walker to help with balance and cannot walk more than 5 steps without having to hold on to the wall or another object to help steady gait. The examiner noted the Veteran was diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in 2004. The examination report indicated the Veteran did not have any vestibular symptoms. The Veteran's gait was noted as steady. The examiner opined the Veteran's vertigo was less likely than not related to his service because medical literature did not show a causal link between tinnitus and vertigo. 

The Board finds the July 2024 opinion inadequate because as it did not address the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset of his vertigo disability. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007); Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020). Further, the opinion did not address the June 2024 medical article that found a link between tinnitus and vertigo.

The Veteran was afforded a third VA examination in October 2024. The examiner noted vestibular symptoms of episodes of vertigo, staggering, and hearing impairment or tinnitus more than once per week. The examination report indicates the Veteran's gait was unsteady. The examiner opined that the Veteran's vertigo was less likely than not related to his service because medical literature did not show a causal link between tinnitus and vertigo.  

The Board finds the October 2024 opinion inadequate because as it did not address the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset of his vertigo disability. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007); Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020). Further, the opinion did not address the June 2024 medical article that found a link between tinnitus and vertigo.

The Board finds this February 2024 VA examination evidence to be sufficient to establish a nexus between the Veteran's vertigo and his service-connected tinnitus. When viewed together, this evidence demonstrates a proximate association between the Veteran's vertigo and tinnitus and that the two conditions are related as demonstrated by their severity increasing and decreasing in tandem. See Bastien v. Shinseki, 599 F.3d 1301, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2010) ("The evaluation and weighing of evidence and the drawing of appropriate inferences from it are factual determinations committed to the discretion of the fact finder."); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011) (drawing an "inference based on the evidence" is at the heart of any adjudication). Importantly, there is no probative evidence of record to contradict this finding. Although there is medical evidence pointing to other etiologies as the cause of his vertigo, they fail to adequately explain why those other etiologies are more likely the cause of his vertigo than tinnitus.

Furthermore, this favorable evidence triggers application of the benefit of the doubt rule. Lynch, supra. Accordingly, all the elements of secondary service connection for vertigo are met, and the benefit sought on appeal is granted.
