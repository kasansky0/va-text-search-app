REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army form November 1984 to April 1992. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2024, with notification sent to the Veteran in June 2024, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for a low back disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The denial of due process may include issuing a Board decision prior to the expiration of the one-year period for a claimant to request a docket change. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, the Board is not rendering a decision on the merits but remanding the case. Accordingly, the Veteran's due process rights are not affected by not waiting until May 31, 2025, the end of the period in which to request a docket change, to remand this case.

Entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

Under the AMA, the Board may only direct the Agency of Original Jurisdiction to conduct development related to pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Remand is necessary to obtain an addendum VA opinion, or a new VA examination if necessary. When VA undertakes to obtain an opinion, it must ensure that the opinion is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). A medical opinion is considered adequate "where it is based on consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and examinations and also describes the disability, if any, in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one." Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).

In a January 1987 service treatment record (STR), the Veteran complained of a low back pain injury. The medical provider stated the Veteran had a possible low back strain. The Veteran was placed on a one-week profile. 

A master problem list in the STR shows the Veteran to have had a low back strain. 

In a September 1991 STR, the Veteran complained of low back pain when lifting a duffle bag. The Veteran stated he felt sharp pain in the low back and is now unable to bend. On follow-up treatment, the medical provider assessed the Veteran to have mechanical low back pain. 

In a December 1997 VA treatment record, the Veteran complained of chronic intermittent low back pain that is non-radiating. The medical provider assessed the Veteran to have chronic low back pain. 

In an April 2015 VA treatment record, the medical provider listed low back pain in the Veteran's history. 

In a December 2017 VA treatment record physical therapy evaluation, the Veteran stated he is having constant pain in the low back and has had the pain for years. 

In a July 2023 private treatment record the Veteran stated he has a history of back pain dating back several decades. The Veteran stated he remembers having back pain when he was a child. 

On the March 2024 VA back examination, the examiner indicated the Veteran has a diagnosis of degenerative arthritis, lumbosacral strain, degenerative spondylosis, and facet arthropathy. The Veteran stated that his low back disability began in 1990. He stated he injured his low back when trying to lift a ruck sack. The Veteran stated he currently experiences back pain with radiation into the legs. 

The May 2024 VA examiner opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's low back disability is the result of active service. The examiner reasoned that there are no records that cite the Veteran's degenerative arthritis, lumbosacral strain, degenerative spondylosis, or facet arthropathy condition during service. Thus, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's low back disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by complaints and treatment for the lower back claim in-service injury, event, or illness. 

The Board finds this medical opinion to be inadequate as a January 1987 STR shows an impression of low back strain, a September 1991 STR shows an assessment for mechanical lower back pain, a master problem list states the Veteran had a low back strain in January 1987, a 1997 VA treatment records shows a complaint of chronic low back pain, and statements from the Veteran indicated experiencing low back pain for decades. None of this evidence was addressed by the VA medical opinion. 

As a result, the Board finds that an addendum medical opinion, or a new VA examination if found necessary, is warranted.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion, and if necessary, an additional VA examination from an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's low back disability. The examiner must opine whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's low back disability is the result of service. Specifically, the examiner is to address the January 1987 STR finding of low back strain, the September 1991STR assessment of mechanical low back pain, the 1997 post-service complaint of chronic low back pain, and the Veteran's statements related to years and decades of low back pain in their opinion.
