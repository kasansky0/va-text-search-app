ORDER

The appeal for service connection for right hip osteoarthritis is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In correspondence received January 28, 2025, the Veteran's attorney notified VA that he wished to withdraw his appeal regarding the claim of entitlement to service connection for right hip osteoarthritis.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran for the claim of entitlement to service connection for right hip osteoarthritis have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1943 to April 1946.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In correspondence received on January 28, 2025, the Veteran's attorney notified VA that he wished to withdraw his appeal.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c). 

Withdrawal of pending appeals

The Board may dismiss any appeal which does not allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal and may be made by the appellant or the authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 19.55(a).

For written withdrawals of an appeal, the regulation applicable to withdrawals is controlling. See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 8 (2020) (written withdrawals need only comply with 38 C.F.R. § 20.204(b), renumbered as 38 C.F.R. § 19.55(b)). It requires, among other things, that the withdrawal be in writing, by the Veteran or his or her representative, and include the file number and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. The Court summarized: "When the Board must analyze whether a written withdrawal is effective, its chief questions are whether the written withdrawal falls under § 20.204(b), renumbered as 38 C.F.R. § 19.55(b), and, if so, whether it complies with that regulation's requirements. If the answer to both questions is yes, then that is generally the end of the matter." Hembree, 33 Vet. App. at 7. 

In this case, the record includes a statement received by VA in January 2025 that was signed by the Veteran's attorney. It included the name of the Veteran and claim number. It stated that the Veteran wished to withdraw his claim for service connection for right hip osteoarthritis.  

With this background, the Board finds the statement received in January 2025 satisfied the written withdrawal requirements outlined in the applicable regulation. It contains the necessary information and is clear that a withdrawal is requested for the issue of entitlement to service connection for right hip osteoarthritis on appeal. Therefore, the Veteran has withdrawn his appeal for entitlement to service connection for right hip osteoarthritis on appeal. Accordingly, the claim for entitlement to service connection for right hip osteoarthritis on appeal is dismissed.
