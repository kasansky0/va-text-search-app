ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The competent medical evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran has hearing loss in either ear, as defined by VA regulations.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1982 to June 1985. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2022 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 2022 rating decision. In December 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 2022 decision.  

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran asserts that entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted. 

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that there is no objective medical evidence to support that the Veteran has a diagnosis of hearing loss in either ear. Therefore, service connection must be denied for the condition.?38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; McClain v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App.?319?(2007);?38 C.F.R.  § 3.303(a), (d). 

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory threshold for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.?38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

Following his initial claim in May 2015, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for hearing loss in August 2015, with testing that revealed the following pure tone thresholds: 

????? 	HERTZ????? 	????? 

? 	500????? 	1000????? 	2000????? 	3000????? 	4000????? 

RIGHT????? 	15	15??? 	10????? 	20?? 	15?? 

LEFT????? 	20	10????? 	15???? 	25????? 	25???? 

The average pure tone threshold result in the right ear was 15, and in the left ear was 18.75.?Speech discrimination scores using the Maryland CNC word list was 100 percent for both ears. The examiner determined that the Veteran had normal hearing in both ears.

After the Veteran filed his May 2022 supplemental claim application, he was notified in a correspondence dated May 18, 2022, that his initial VA examination for hearing loss was rescheduled to May 26, 2022. In a June 2022 exam scheduling request contention cancellation, it is noted that the Veteran was a no-show for this examination. 

VA's duty to assist is not a one-way street. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). The Veteran must cooperate with VA's efforts to obtain evidence necessary to adjudicate his claims, including attending scheduled VA examinations. Should the Veteran be unable to attend a scheduled VA examination, he must promptly communicate with VA the reason why he cannot attend and participate in attempts to reschedule. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

When a Veteran misses a scheduled VA examination, the Board must consider (1) whether the examination was necessary to establish entitlement to the benefit sought, and (2) whether the Veteran lacked good cause to miss the scheduled examination. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a); Turk v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 565, 569 (2008). 

The Board finds that this examination was necessary for the claim, and the Veteran has not offered any reason for why he did not report for his examination without good cause. As the Veteran, without good cause, did not attend the most recent scheduled VA examination, the Board will adjudicate this claim on the basis of the evidence of record. 

An August 2015 audiogram report notes that the Veteran's hearing is within normal limits. Besides this, the May 2015 VA examination represents the only hearing loss examination available in the claims file. The Board also notes that VA medical records do not show any diagnosis of or treatment for a bilateral hearing loss disability. 

The Veteran submitted a lay statement in May 2022 noting that he was exposed to frequent varying levels of ear noise trauma during service due to his military occupational specialty (MOS) and during basic training when he did not always have access to noise protection and hearing protection was of poor quality. The Veteran also reported on how hearing loss has greatly affected his quality of life. The Board notes that the AOJ conceded noise exposure due to the Veteran's MOS, and that is not at issue here. The Veteran's statement does not indicate that he has a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss. 

The Board recognizes that the Veteran, as a lay person, is competent to describe the symptoms of bilateral hearing loss. Layno?v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 469 (1994). However, the results from the May 2015 VA examination, undisturbed as they are by any contrary medical evidence, have far more probative weight than the lay testimony as to the Veteran's hearing difficulty. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337?(Fed. Cir. 2006). Lay persons such as the Veteran are not competent to provide the audiometric findings necessary for a finding of a?hearing loss?disability as defined by?38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The fact remains that the post-service medical records do not contain a diagnosis of?hearing loss?in either ear for VA purposes pursuant to?38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Without a diagnosis by a medical professional, there is no valid claim of service connection under?38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) for such disability. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3?Vet. App.?223, 225?(1992); 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b). 

Accordingly, as the evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran has bilateral hearing loss pursuant to VA regulations, the claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.
