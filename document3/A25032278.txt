DOCKET NO. 241003-479592
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction's August 2024 rating decision was not a decision on the issue of service connection for PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal regarding service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may make decisions in appeals on all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary of the VA under a law that affects the provision of VA benefits.  38 C.F.R. § 20.104.  An appeal consists of a Notice of Disagreement timely filed to the Board on any issue for which VA provided notice of a decision.  38 U.S.C. § 5104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.4.

In this case, the Veteran appealed an August 2024 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that deferred a decision on entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  See October 2024 VA Form 10182.  This deferral is not an appealable decision subject to Board review.  The AOJ did not decide any question of law or fact, but instead stated that it would adjudicate the claim after further development.  Accordingly, there is no question of law or fact for Board review, and the appeal regarding service connection for PTSD is dismissed.
