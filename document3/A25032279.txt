ORDER

An effective date prior to November 17, 2022, for the assignment of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) received the Veteran's intent to file on November 19, 2020, VA Form 21-526EZ claiming entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability and a TDIU in April 2021, and formal application seeking TDIU as a component of any or all service-connected conditions in June 2021.

2. Prior to November 17, 2022, the Veteran did not meet the percentage requirements for a schedular TDIU; and, there is not sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran is unemployable by reason of his service-connected disabilities. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to November 17, 2022, for the assignment of a TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1973 to November 1974 and from September 1976 to November 1978. Prior thereto, he served in the Marine Corps Reserve, including on a period of active duty for training from August 1972 to February 1973. His claim comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an April 2024 Regional Office rating decision granting a TDIU effective November 17, 2022. 

This claim originates from a September 2022 Supplemental Claim for an increased rating for a psychiatric disability and a TDIU. In December 2022, the AOJ increased the 50 percent rating assigned the psychiatric disability to 70 percent and denied a TDIU. In December 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review of the TDIU denial, and later that month, the AOJ granted a TDIU. In the VA Form 10182 disagreeing with the effective date assigned the TDIU, the Veteran elected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge as the Board review option. Therefore, in considering this claim, the Board may only review the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's December 2022 denial of the Supplemental Claim. 38 C.F.R. 

§ 20.301. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence submitted or associated with the record beyond the period allowed, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) identifying it. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence that the AOJ previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to November 17, 2022, for the assignment of a TDIU

In an April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted the Veteran a TDIU effective November 17, 2022. The Veteran seeks an effective date of November 19, 2020, for the TDIU. He claims that, pursuant to Rice v Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the TDIU is inextricably intertwined with his request for a higher rating for his psychiatric condition, and "they have been continuously pursued since their implication." He further claims that no formal claim needs to be filed when the issue of a TDIU is raised in connection with a pending claim before VA. A claimant who is awarded a TDIU based on a service-connected disability that renders him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation is entitled to an award of increased compensation, effective the earliest date it was ascertainable that the increase in disability occurred. 

The evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced, persuasively weighing against granting an earlier effective date. The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application). 

The effective date of the award of an increase in compensation is either the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1). The exception to the rule allows for the earliest date as of which it was factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if the claim was received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). A claim for TDIU is a claim for increased compensation if, as in this case, the disability upon which entitlement to TDIU is based has already been found to be service connected. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Accordingly, the assignment of an effective date is controlled by the criteria for assigning the effective date for an increased rating. Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 367, 369 (1991).

The reference "the date entitlement arose" is not defined in any current statute or regulation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has interpreted it as the date when a claimant meets the requirements for the benefit sought, and the matter is determined on a "facts found" basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

All claims filed on or after March 24, 2015, must be submitted on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). If a formal application for benefits is received within a year of an intent to file, the date of claim for effective date purposes is the date the intent to file was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii). If a supplemental claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the date of claim for effective date purposes is also the date the intent to file was received. See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (invalidating 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, in part).

An effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from the date that the AOJ issues notice of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the receipt date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the receipt date of the most recent request for review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). Following notice of a decision on a claim, a claimant may establish continuous pursuit by filing a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, or filing an appeal to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(1). Following notice of an AOJ's decision on a higher-level review request, a claimant may establish continuous pursuit by filing either a supplemental claim or an appeal to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 2.5000(c)(2). 

If VA receives a supplemental claim application more than one year after the AOJ or Board notifies a claimant of a decision, the continuous pursuit of that claim is broken unless VA grants an extension of the one-year period for good cause shown and the supplemental claim application is received within the extension period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(e)(2), (h)(2). Otherwise, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

Here, as the Veteran contends and the following timeline shows, the "date of claim" for effective date purposes is November 19, 2020. This is the date the AOJ received the Veteran's intent to file. In April 2021, the Veteran followed up by filing a VA Form 21-526EZ claiming entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability and a TDIU, and in June 2021, after the AOJ informed the Veteran by letter that he needed to submit his claim on a standardized form, he filed a formal application seeking TDIU as a component of "[a]ny and [a]ll of [his] service connected conditions." See Rice v Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. at 447. 

Thereafter, the Veteran continuously pursued his TDIU claim as a component of his claim for a psychiatric disability until the AOJ granted it. More specifically, in an April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted the Veteran service connection for major depressive disorder, assigned that disability an initial 50 percent rating, and denied a TDIU. In September 2022, the Veteran submitted additional evidence and a Supplemental Claim requesting a higher evaluation for his psychiatric disability and a TDIU. In October 2022, he filed a formal TDIU application. In a December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ increased the rating assigned the psychiatric disability to 70 percent effective November 17, 2022, and denied a TDIU. In December 2023, within the year, the Veteran filed a request for higher-level review of the TDIU denial, and in April 2024, the AOJ granted a TDIU effective November 17, 2022. As the AOJ granted the TDIU based solely on the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder, the action was a culmination of the initial claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability and a TDIU. 

A TDIU may be assigned when a veteran is unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment as a result of service-connected disabilities provided that (s)he is in receipt of a disability rating of 60 percent or greater, or if (s)he is service-connected for two or more disabilities, at least one of those disabilities is assigned a disability rating greater than 40 percent, and the combined disability rating for all disabilities is at least 70 percent. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a). 

When the percentage requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) are not met, a total rating may be still be assigned if a veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities. In such a case, under 38 C.F.R.§ 4.16(b), the rating board should submit the case to the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service for extraschedular consideration. 

The Board is precluded from assigning a TDIU on an extraschedular basis in the first instance. However, it must specifically adjudicate the issue of whether referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted. Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 8-10 (2001).

The AOJ has conceded that the Veteran is not working, retired in 2008, was last employed in 2020, and, effective November 17, 2022, has service-connected disabilities meeting the percentage standards of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Prior to November 17, 2022, the current effective date of the TDIU grant, the Veteran did not meet these percentage requirements. He was service connected for major depressive disorder, then rated 50 percent disabling, and tinnitus, rated 10 percent disabling, and had a combined disability rating of 60 percent. The question is thus whether, for the period preceding November 17, 2022, a referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted.

Unfortunately, the reviewable evidence speaking to the matter of whether, prior to November 17, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability was so severe that it rendered him unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, warranting a referral, is scant and somewhat unreliable. 

The Veteran presented to a VA facility in November 2020 to establish care, and thereafter, he received treatment telephonically from January 2021 through May 2021 only. He reported that he was retired; therefore, no provider discussed the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms in the context of employment. The treatment reports of record consist primarily of the Veteran's reported histories, upon which the providers relied in diagnosing the Veteran and providing him medication. The Veteran also underwent a Disability Benefits Questionnaire examination, and the report of that examination focuses largely on the Veteran's reported histories during treatment visits and the examination. The Veteran has not explained how his psychiatric disability interfered with his ability to work, and he has not submitted information from an employer that might shed light on the matter. In addition, the record conflicts regarding his employment history and the severity of his psychiatric disability.  

This reviewable evidence nonetheless establishes that the Veteran had some degree of occupational impairment prior to November 17, 2022, but not impairment so severe that it rendered the Veteran unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of his major depressive disorder. Based on this fact, a referral for extraschedular consideration is not warranted.

In his June 2021 TDIU application, the Veteran indicated that he had been under a doctor's care since January 2021, and in his October 2022 TDIU application, he indicated that he had had posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment from February to May 2021. His treatment records basically confirm the timeline, not the 2021 PTSD diagnosis, showing that, in November 2020, the day after he submitted an intent to file, he presented to VA to establish care, reporting multiple medical conditions. He did not mention his mental health until February 2021, when he contacted VA's National Suicide Prevention Hotline because he was having suicidal thoughts. Based on this call, he began mental health treatment at the VA facility where he had established care, and this treatment included virtual risk assessments and group therapy. In March 2021, he was prescribed medication for depression/moderate major depressive disorder, and thereafter, providers continued to treat the Veteran, including with the prescribed medication, diagnosing no other psychiatric disability. The Veteran's last VA treatment visit for mental health occurred, and his last VA prescription was entered, in May 2021, a month after the AOJ granted him service connection for a psychiatric disability.

During the February to May 2021 treatment visits, providers noted that the Veteran had daily depression that worsened during Covid and on the three-year anniversary of his daughter's death. They also noted, or the Veteran reported, that he had a depressed mood, anxiety, panic, decreased concentration, recurrent suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, worthlessness, guilt, fatigue, and psychotic features. The providers characterized the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder as moderate. None discussed the effect of the psychiatric symptoms on the Veteran's occupational functioning. 

In September 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-4192 (Request For Employment Information In Connection With Claim For Disability Benefits), but it includes his identifying information and the name of one of his employers only. The Employment Information section, to be completed by the employer, is blank.

Since filing this claim, the Veteran has occasionally mentioned his employment status, and his statements have been inconsistent. According to his June 2021 TDIU application, service-connected conditions began affecting his full-time employment as a policeman in June 2008. That is when he purportedly last worked because he became too disabled to do so, and at that time, he was earning $50,000 annually and had earned $26,000 during the prior 12 months. According to treatment records dated in March 2021, however, the Veteran stopped working "a year ago." During 2021 treatment visits, the Veteran indicated that he had been a police officer for 30 years and was retired. In a September 2021 written statement, he indicated that he last worked from January 2020 to March 2020, and in his October 2022 TDIU application, he indicated that he last worked full time in April 2020 in RV delivery earning $40,000 annually and, due to PTSD, became too disabled to work in June 2020. In a September 2022 written statement claiming that his PTSD, anxiety, and depression had worsened, he reported that his job made him go to counseling, and he ended up leaving the job due to these conditions.  

In August 2021, the Veteran underwent a mental disorders Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) examination and completed an Individual Unemployability Statement, in which he reported that he had difficulty attending to or was easily distracted from the task at hand, had significant difficulty functioning around other people, including as a team member, felt uncomfortable around others, and was so depressed that he had difficulty sustaining energy and motivation to complete assignments at work. During the examination, the Veteran comprehensively addressed his history of mental health issues since service, his current mental health state, and his psychosocial functioning. He also addressed his occupational history and indicated that he retired in 2008, but he did not elaborate on the occupational impairment he mentioned in his written statement. 

The examiner noted that the Veteran had a depressed mood, suspiciousness, mild memory loss, circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting. Based on these symptoms, the examiner characterized the Veteran's major depressive disorder as recurrent and moderate, causing occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, not total impairment, occupational or otherwise. 

VA treatment records dated in 2022 reflect no mental health care and an active list of only two medications, neither prescribed for mental health symptoms. Records from Sleep Clinics Of America, Inc., reflect an entered prescription for sertraline, an antidepressant, and a PTSD diagnosis in April 2022 and include a note indicating a past medical history of "depression (Stable)". No provider from this facility addressed the effect of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms on his occupational functioning. In May 2022, during a visit to VA for an unrelated condition, the Veteran denied suicidal or homicidal ideation and indicated that he was on medication for depression.    

In a September 2022 written statement, the Veteran indicated that his psychiatric conditions, to include PTSD, anxiety, and depression, had worsened and was affecting his marriage, that he was more irritable than not, had a short fuse and no close friends, and struggled to maintain relationships. He further indicated that he isolated to avoid people and going places, didn't like crowds or business, got over stimulated and paranoid, didn't trust people, always checked around at home, making sure everything was okay, had brain fog and kept a legal pad around to remember things, occasionally got in a funk and didn't want to do anything, had had suicidal ideation, called a suicide hotline in the past because he wanted to act on it, called again last week, and had days when he thought it would be better not to be here. The Veteran indicated that he needed continued counseling and medication to function normally. 

On November 17, 2022, the Veteran submitted another written statement and underwent a Mental Disorders DBQ examination, the report of which formed the basis of the AOJ's April 2024 TDIU grant.  

The Veteran claims that he left his job due to his psychiatric disability. This assertion conflicts with treatment records and the August 2021 examiner's DBQ opinion, the only medical evidence of record dated prior to November 2022 that specifically addresses the Veteran's occupational functioning secondary to his psychiatric disability. This opinion confirms that the Veteran had difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships and adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting. These findings, however, do not establish an inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation due to a psychiatric disability. Despite the noted difficulties, the examiner characterized the Veteran's psychiatric disability as moderate, causing only reduced reliability and productivity, not a complete inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. This characterization is supported by the treatment records dated during the same time frame, which show that, between May 2021 and April 2022, the Veteran did not seek mental health care, did not use medication for mental health issues, and had stable depression.

Given the forgoing, the evidence is not sufficient to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was unemployable by reason of his service-connected disabilities prior to November 17, 2022. The Board recognizes that the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability and tinnitus may have caused some occupational impairment, but the evidence does not raise a reasonable possibility that the Veteran service-connected disabilities caused him to be unable to sustain gainful employment. To the extent that his service-connected disabilities affected his employability, the assigned 60 percent combined rating for his service-connected tinnitus and major depressive disorder compensated him for such impairment. Indeed, disability ratings are intended to compensate impairment in earning capacity due to a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. Thus, referral for extraschedular consideration for a TDIU rating is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). As the Veteran does not meet the schedular requirements for a TDIU and referral is not appropriate in this case, entitlement to TDIU must be denied. 

Accordingly, in light of the above, there is no reasonable possibility of substantiating a claim for a TDIU prior to November 17, 2022; and, as such, referral for extraschedular consideration of a TDIU prior to November 17, 2022 is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.16.
