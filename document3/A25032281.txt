DOCKET NO. 210607-284216
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on December 31, 2020, is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment of the cost of the December 31, 2020, medical services provided by the appellant. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on December 31, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38?U.S.C. ยง?7105; 38?C.F.R. ยง?20.801. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In June 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the appellant electing the Direct Review docket to review a March 2021 Explanation of Benefits/decisional letter issued by a VA AOJ. 

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on December 31, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and entitlement to the fully requested payment amount was approved for the December 31, 2020, medical services.  Payment details indicate the appellant was paid on May 5, 2021, via Check/EFT 0992831.  

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the claimed medical services constitutes a reversal of the March 2021 denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38?U.S.C. ยง?7105(d).
