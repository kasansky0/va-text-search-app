DOCKET NO. 211110-197023
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

As the claim has been withdrawn, entitlement to a total disability evaluation based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 28, 2022, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran or his authorized representative are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2021 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the November 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected a hearing before a Veterans Law judge.

Withdrawal of Claims

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In the present case, the appellant, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
