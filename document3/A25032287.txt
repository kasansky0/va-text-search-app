FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A February 2012 rating decision addressing acquired psychiatric disorders, lower back pain, and concussion residuals had become final; the Veteran did not file a substantive appeal, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) did not receive new and material evidence within one year of the rating decision.

2. The Veteran has submitted sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of regularity, but the claims file demonstrates actual receipt of the April 2016 notice and rating decision.

3. With respect to the issues of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and a TBI with migraine headaches, the April 2016 rating decision had not become final because VA received new and material evidence as to these issues within one year of the rating decision.

4. With respect to the issues of service connection for a lumbosacral strain, cervical DDD, and bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy secondary to cervical DDD, the April 2016 rating decision had become final; the Veteran did not file a substantive appeal, and VA did not receive new and material evidence within one year of VA resending the April 2016 rating decision in July 2016 as to these issues. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than May 25, 2018, for the award of service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 5108, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.102, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

5. The criteria for an effective date earlier than May 25, 2018, for the award of service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy associated with cervical DDD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 5108, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.102, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

6. The criteria for an effective date earlier than May 25, 2018, for the award of service connection for left upper extremity radiculopathy associated with cervical DDD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 5108, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.102, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 2008 to March 2011.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2019 higher-level review decision, following a May 2019 rating decision, by a VA regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran elected the Board's Hearing docket. See August 2019 VA Form 10182. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the May 2019 rating decision and any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). The Veteran appeared for the hearing before a Veterans Law Judge in March 2021.

In a September 2021 decision, the Board awarded an earlier effective date for the awards of service connection for cervical DDD, bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy, and migraine headaches. The decision denied earlier effective dates for the service-connected PTSD, the TBI, and the lumbosacral strain. The Board also denied an earlier effective date for a TDIU rating. The Veteran appealed the decision, and in July 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) issued an Order granting a joint motion for partial remand (JMPR) that vacated in part the Board's September 2021 decision and remanded the issues of earlier effective dates for action consistent with the terms of the JMPR. The parties agreed that the Board failed to address all evidence when it determined that the presumption of regularity attached. The issue as to an earlier effective date for a TDIU rating was found as inextricably intertwined with the other issues. 

In a September 2022 decision, the Board denied earlier effective dates for all issues on appeal. The Veteran appealed this decision, and in July 2024, the Court issued a Memorandum Decision setting aside the September 2022 decision and remanding all claims. Though the Veteran had not previously raised the argument, the Court found the Board failed to address whether the Veteran's July 2016 correspondence contained new and material evidence to warrant reopening one or more of the issues under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). See July 2016 VA Form 21-4138. The issue as to an earlier effective date for a TDIU rating was again found to be inextricably intertwined with the other issues.

Effective Dates

The law regarding effective dates of an award of disability compensation provides that, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). This statutory provision is implemented in the regulations, which provides that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

In general, an intent to file can be submitted by saving an electronic application, VA receipt of a VA Form 20-0966, or a written record of the veteran's oral intent to file an application by a VA employee. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a)(1).

Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA, from a claimant or a claimant's representative, may be considered an informal claim, provided that it identified the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (prior to March 24, 2015). Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. Id. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim. Id. 

Reports of examination or hospitalization from VA, private physicians, or state or other institutions, may be accepted in certain circumstances as an informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.157 (removed as of March 24, 2015).

Since March 24, 2015, all claims must be filed on a prescribed form. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151. A veteran may indicate an intent to file a claim by saving an electronic application, submitting an intent to file claim form, or orally communicating the intent to a designated VA personnel that is then recorded in writing. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). The VA will consider the first VA Form 21-526EZ or VA Form 20-0995 received within one year from receipt of the intent to file as filed on the date the intent to file was received. Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501.

The Federal Circuit Court held in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021), that the exclusion of supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework in 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i) was arbitrary and capricious because it squarely contradicted other provisions within the same regulation that indicate the effective date of a supplemental claim can be earlier than the date VA receives a complete supplemental claim. Military-Veterans Advocacy, 7 F.4th at 1147. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 25, 2018, for the award of service connection of PTSD.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 25, 2018, for the award of service connection for residuals of a TBI, to include migraine headaches.

Under the Legacy appeal system, a rating decision will become final if the veteran does not file a notice of disagreement within one year from the date the notice of the rating decision was mailed, and VA received no new and material evidence within that one-year period. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d), 19.52. Following the one-year period, a final decision may be reopened only if new and material evidence is submitted (or readjudicated if new and relevant evidence is submitted for appeals with an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019). 38 U.S.C. § 5108(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156. 

"New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened, and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim." 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a). When determining whether the claim should be reopened, the credibility of the newly submitted evidence is to be presumed. Fortuck v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 173, 179-80 (2003).

The requirement that new and material evidence raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim is a low threshold. The phrase "raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim" enables, rather than precludes, reopening. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a); Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110, 121 (2010).

For government agencies such as the VA, there is a presumption of regularity that government officials perform their duties "correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with law and governing regulations." Ala. Airlines, Inc. v. Johnson, 8 F.3d 791, 795 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (quoting Parsons v. United States, 229 Ct. Cl. 335, 339, 670 F.2d 164, 166 (Ct. Cl. 1982)); see also Marsh v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 381, 385 (2005). For the purposes of this appeal, the presumption of regularity extends to officials at the AOJ who are responsible for notifying claimants of a rating decision. Woods v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 214, 220-21 (2000); see also Mindenhall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 271, 274 (1994) (applying the presumption of regularity to the AOJ's mailing of its decision to a veteran). A claimant may rebut the presumption by submitting clear evidence to the effect that VA's regular mailing practices were not regular or that they were not followed, and the burden then shifts to the Secretary to establish that the correspondence at issue was mailed to the veteran. Woods, 14 Vet. App. at 220; see also Davis v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 298, 300 (1994). An assertion of nonreceipt, standing alone, does not rebut the presumption of regularity in VA's mailing process. Crain v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 182, 186 (2003); see also Clark v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 61, 63-64 (2001) (when the presumption of regularity has been rebutted, a mailing defect, such as mailing to an incorrect apartment number, may be cured by proof that the decision was actually received by the party to whom it was sent; the period to file an appeal does not begin to run until the date on which that defect is cured by actual receipt).

The Board's initial inquiry is whether the February 2012 rating decision became final with respect to these issues. The Veteran filed his initial application for compensation benefits in March 2011, roughly two weeks before he formally separated from service. See March 2011 VA Form 21-526c. He identified various claims of service connection, including for "concussion residuals," adjustment disorder, depression, and insomnia. A February 2012 rating decision denied all claims. See February 2012 Rating Decision - Narrative & Codesheet. The rating decision noted that there was no diagnosis and that the Veteran had failed to report to scheduled VA examinations. The STRs showed no evidence of neurological residuals following an October 2008 incident during an airborne operation and, "[a]lthough there is one treatment record showing depression complaint during military service, there was no diagnosis of either depression or adjustment disorder given during military service." Id.

The notice of the February 2012 rating decision was mailed to the address of the Veteran's mother, which an inquiry showed to be the Veteran's then-current address. See March 2012 Notification Letter; see also March 2011 VA Form 21-526c; February 2012 VA Memo; June 2015 Military Personnel Record. Though the address identified the apartment number as 11 rather than 11B, VA did not receive the notice back as undeliverable. 

Additionally, in March 2014, the Veteran filed a Privacy Act request for "a copy of his rating letter from March 6, 2013 [sic]." See March 2014 FOIA/Privacy Act Request. VA mailed the February 2012 rating decision and March 2012 notice of decision to the address the Veteran identified on his request ([REDACTED] Street address in Ocala, Florida) the same day.  

The Board finds that the Veteran has successfully rebutted the presumption of regularity as to the March 2012 notice of the February 2012 rating decision but that there is still evidence of actual notice. In August 2011, the AOJ sent a correspondence to the Veteran's [REDACTED] Street address in Ocala, Florida, that was returned as "UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED, UNABLE TO FORWARD." See August 2011 Notification Letter & Returned Mail. Although the AOJ did perform a search of the Veteran's current and past addresses, the AOJ improperly addressed the notice with the incorrect apartment number. See February 2012 VA Memo; March 2012 Notice of Decision. However, the fact that the notice was not returned undeliverable demonstrates actual receipt. Davis v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 29, 37 (holding that to rebut presumption of regularity in mailing, the appellant must establish both that mailing was returned as undeliverable and that there were other possible and plausible addresses available to VA). 

Moreover, even if the Board had not found actual receipt of the March 2012 notice, VA resent the notice in March 2014. This correspondence was not returned as undeliverable.

VA then received the Veteran's intent to file a second application for compensation benefits in May 2015, which was followed by VA Forms 21-526EZ and 21-8940 about one week later. See May 2015 Notification Letter. 

The May 2015 intent to file was received more than 3 years after the March 2012 notice of the February 2012 rating decision was mailed (and not returned undeliverable). VA received no evidence, including lay statements, pertinent to the claims of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder or TBI/residuals between March 2012 and March 2013. Additionally, no evidence was received within 1 year of VA remailing the notice and rating decision in March 2014. VA also did not add any pertinent documentation to the claims file between sending the March 2012 notice and receiving the May 2015 intent to file. Thus, the February 2012 rating decision became final.

The Board's second inquiry is whether the April 2016 rating decision became final as to these issues. The record reflects that the Veteran filed a second application for compensation benefits and an application for a TDIU rating in May 2015. See May 2015 VA Form 21-526EZ & 21-8940. Of note, the Veteran identified his then-current address as [REDACTED] Street in Ocala, Florida. He identified various claims of service connection. He requested to reopen is claims of service connection for "depression, adjustment disorder and insomnia" and "concussion residuals." He also identified claims of service connection for headaches/migraines, drug and alcohol abuse, personality disorder, psychotic depressive reaction, PTSD, and war neurosis. In a separate statement, he noted that he was "hazed every day to the point of me wanting to die, I don't want to go into detail on a [explicit] computer because I don't have the time nor patience for technology." See May 2016 VA Forms 21-0781 & 21-0781a. 

The claims file shows the AOJ obtained copies of VA treatment records covering March 2014 to March 2016. See April 2016 CAPRI. 

The April 2016 rating decision denied claims of service connection for "depression, adjustment disorder and insomnia (also claimed as major depression)" and concussion residuals. The rating decision states, in part, that "[t]he evidence from VAMC records submitted in connection with the current claim does not constitute new and material evidence because it does not relate to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim and does not raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim" and that the Veteran had not demonstrated good cause for failing to attend scheduled VA examinations. "The evidence does not show that your depression resulted from, or was aggravated by, a service-connected disability, and you are not service connected for PTSD. Therefore, the claim for service connection for depression, adjustment disorder and insomnia (also claimed as major depression) remains denied because the evidence submitted is not new and material." The claim for a neurological condition was denied because there was no evidence that the Veteran had been clinically diagnosed with such condition.

The April 2016 rating decision also denied the claim of service connection for "[PTSD] (also claimed as war neurosis, sleep disturbances, psychotic depressive reaction, nervousness, and memory loss, and as due to personal trauma)." Id. The rating decision stated, in part, that "[t]he available medical evidence is insufficient to confirm a link between current symptoms and an in-service stressor" and that the Veteran did not show good cause for failing to attend a VA examination. "Your service treatment records do not contain complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for this condition. The evidence does not show an event, disease or injury in service. Therefore, service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder is denied."

On July 13, 2016, VA received a correspondence from the Veteran's then-newly appointed representative. See July 2016 VA Form 21-22. It included an executed intent to file for compensation benefits. See also July 2016 VA Form 21-0966 (signed by the Veteran). It also included a lay statement authored by the Veteran about his mental health symptoms. See July 2016 VA Form 21-4138. He stated his duties during a deployment included patrolling urban areas, targeted raids, and guard duties. He recounted being exposed to direct fire (such as sniper fire) and indirect fire; he was also exposed to improvised explosive devices. He forcibly entered various structures during the deployment and was now unable to move through doorway and thresholds without having flashbacks or total disorientation. He also noted issues with aggressiveness/violence, sleepwalking, and problems with sleep in general. He was seen by Combat Stress 19 times during his deployment. He also recounted in some detail that he was physically and mentally abused by superiors during his deployment. He pursued assistance through the Criminal Investigative Division (CID), which resulted in him being reassigned to another unit on the same base. During one episode of abuse, he lost consciousness and that, due to "several" head injuries, he experiences chronic headaches that can last up to 3 days and are accompanied by nausea, black outs, and weight loss.

Setting aside the issue of presumption of regularity, the Board finds VA received new and material evidence as to the claimed acquired psychiatric disorder and residuals from a TBI within one year of the April 2016 rating decision. The lay statement consists of new evidence not previously of record; the Veteran did not previously disclose this level of detail about his stressors and headaches. See May 2016 VA Forms 21-0781 & 21-0781a. The lay statements in combination with STRs showing he received treatment for mental health problems during service and his personnel file showing he was separated from service (at least in part) because he was diagnosed with an adjustment disorder with depressed mood and borderline traits is material as to the elements of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder in general. See June 2015 STR & Military Personnel Record. His statements about head injuries and ongoing problems with headaches in combination with STRs and VA treatment records showing complaints of headaches is also material as to the elements of service connection for a TBI and residual symptoms. 

Thus, with respect to the Veteran's claims of service connection and ultimate award of service connection for PTSD and TBI with migraine headaches, the April 2016 rating decision had not become final. The claims for an effective date earlier than May 25, 2018, for these claims are granted.

In order to preserve the Veteran's right to file a supplemental claim, higher-level review, or appeal to the Board should he disagree with the assigned effective date, the AOJ must be allowed to assign an effective date prior to May 25, 2018, in the first instance. Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394, 399 (2010).

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 25, 2018, for the award of service connection for lumbosacral strain.

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 25, 2018, for the award of service connection for cervical DDD. 

5. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 25, 2018, for the award of service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy associated with cervical DDD. 

6. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 25, 2018, for the award of service connection for left upper extremity radiculopathy associated with cervical DDD. 

As previously stated above, under the Legacy appeal system, a rating decision will become final if the veteran does not file a notice of disagreement within one year from the date the notice of the rating decision was mailed, and VA receives no new and material evidence within that 1-year period. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d), 19.52. Following the 1-year period, a final decision may be reopened only if new and material evidence is submitted (or readjudicated if new and relevant evidence is submitted for appeals with an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019). 38 U.S.C. § 5108(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156. 

"New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened, and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim." 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a). When determining whether the claim should be reopened, the credibility of the newly submitted evidence is to be presumed. Fortuck, 17 Vet. App. at 179-80.

The requirement that new and material evidence raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim is a low threshold. The phrase "raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim" enables, rather than precludes, reopening. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a); Shade, 24 Vet. App. 110, 121.

For government agencies such as the VA, there is a presumption of regularity that government officials perform their duties "correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with law and governing regulations." Ala. Airlines, Inc., 8 F.3d at 795 (quoting Parsons, 229 Ct. Cl. at 339, 670 F.2d 164, 166; see also Marsh, 19 Vet. App. at 385. For the purposes of this appeal, the presumption of regularity extends to officials at the AOJ who are responsible for notifying claimants of a rating decision. Woods, 14 Vet. App. at 220-21; see also Mindenhall, 7 Vet. App. at 274 (applying the presumption of regularity to the AOJ's mailing of its decision to a veteran). A claimant may rebut the presumption by submitting clear evidence to the effect that VA's regular mailing practices were not regular or that they were not followed, and the burden then shifts to the Secretary to establish that the VA decision was mailed to the veteran. Woods, 14 Vet. App. at 220; see also Davis, 7 Vet. App. at 300. An assertion of nonreceipt, standing alone, does not rebut the presumption of regularity in VA's mailing process. Crain, 17 Vet. App. at 186; see also Clark, 15 Vet. App. at 63-64 (when the presumption of regularity has been rebutted, a mailing defect, such as mailing to an incorrect apartment number, may be cured by proof that the decision was actually received by the party to whom it was sent; the period to file an appeal does not begin to run until the date on which that defect is cured by actual receipt).

The Board's initial inquiry is whether the February 2012 rating decision became final with respect to the issue of service connection for a back disability. The record reflects that the Veteran filed an initial application for compensation benefits in March 2011 prior to him separating from service. See March 2011 VA Form 21-526c. He identified various claims of service connection, including for lower back pain. A February 2012 rating decision denied this claim. See February 2012 Rating Decision - Narrative & Codesheet. "NODX, [Failure To Report], 1702." The STRs contained a single complaint of a backache but no diagnosis. 

The notice of the February 2012 rating decision was mailed to the address of the Veteran's mother, which an inquiry showed to be the Veteran's most current address. See March 2012 Notification Letter; see also March 2011 VA Form 21-526c; February 2012 VA Memo; June 2015 Military Personnel Record. Though the address identified the apartment number as 11 rather than 11B, VA did not receive the notice back as undeliverable. 

Additionally, in March 2014, the Veteran filed a Privacy Act request for "a copy of his rating letter from March 6, 2013 [sic]." See March 2014 FIOA/Privacy Act Request. VA mailed the February 2012 rating decision and March 2012 notice of decision to the address the Veteran identified on his request ([REDACTED] Street address in Ocala, Florida) the same day. 

The Board finds the Veteran has rebutted the presumption of regularity as to the March 2012 notice of the February 2012 rating decision. In August 2011, a correspondence to the Veteran's [REDACTED] Street address in Ocala, Florida was returned as "UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED[,] UNABLE TO FORWARD." See August 2011 Notification Letter & Returned Mail. Although the AOJ did perform a search of the Veteran's current and past addresses, the AOJ improperly addressed a second notice with an incorrect apartment number. See February 2012 VA Memo; March 2012 Notice of Decision. However, the fact that the notice was not returned undeliverable demonstrates actual receipt. Davis, 17 Vet. App. at 37. 

Moreover, VA resent the March 2012 notice and February 2012 rating decision in March 2014 to the Veteran's then-last known address, which was not returned as undeliverable.

VA did not receive the Veteran's intent to file a second application for compensation benefits until May 2015, which was followed by VA Forms 21-526EZ and 21-8940 about one week later. See May 2015 Notification Letter. 

The May 2015 intent to file was received more than 3 years after the March 2012 notice of the February 2012 rating decision was mailed (and not returned undeliverable). VA received no evidence, including lay statements, pertinent to the claims of service connection for a back disability between March 2012 and March 2013. Additionally, no evidence was received within 1 year of VA remailing the notice and rating decision in March 2014. VA also did not add any pertinent documentation to the claims file prior to receiving the May 2015 intent to file. Thus, the February 2012 rating decision became final.

The Board's second inquiry is whether the April 2016 rating decision became final with regard to the back disability, neck disability, and upper extremity radiculopathy. The record reflects that the Veteran filed a second application for compensation benefits and an application for a TDIU rating in May 2015. See May 2015 VA Form 21-526EZ & 21-8940. Of note, the Veteran identified his then-current address as [REDACTED] Street in Ocala, Florida. He requested to reopen is claim of service connection for lower back pain and new claims for nerve damage, neck condition, painful joints, and spine. 

The claims file shows that the AOJ obtained copies of VA treatment records covering March 2014 to March 2016. See April 2016 CAPRI. 

The April 2016 rating decision denied these claims. The back disability was denied because the evidence was not new and material. The claim for a neck condition (to include claims of the spine and muscle and joint pain) and nerve damage were denied because, although there was evidence of treatment related to the neck during service, there was no evidence of permanent or chronic disabilities. No disability had developed to a compensable degree within a specified period after separating from service to qualify for presumptive service connection. 

Of note, while the AOJ was developing the claims, multiple correspondences were returned as undeliverable. In the May 2015 applications, the Veteran identified his then-current address as [REDACTED] Street in Ocala, Florida. A correspondence sent less than one week later was returned undeliverable due to "MOVED LEFT NO ADDRESS[,] UNABLE TO FORWARD." See August 2015 Returned Mail. In a VA Form 21-22 executed on June 1, 2015, the veteran identified his then-current address as Business Park Boulevard in Daytona, Florida. See also June 2015 VA 20-572 (incorrect state abbreviation). About three weeks later, VA received a second change of address form for a North [REDACTED] Avenue (no apartment number) address in Daytona Beach, Florida. A correspondence sent less than 2 weeks later to the North [REDACTED] Avenue address was returned undeliverable due to "INSUFFICIENT ADDRESS[,] UNABLE TO FORWARD." See August 2015 Returned Mail; see also October 2015 & November 2015 Returned Mail. 

In December 2015, the AOJ obtained a basic report of the Veteran's address history. See December 2015 Web/HTML Documents. The query listed the Veteran's then-current address as North [REDACTED] Avenue in Daytona Beach, Florida. The report provided an apartment number not previously disclosed. The following day, the AOJ addressed a correspondence to a Northeast [REDACTED] Street address in Ocala, Florida, which was returned as undeliverable "INSUFFICIENT ADDRESS[,] UNABLE TO FORWARD." See December 2015 Correspondence. The query completed one day earlier had not identified this address but had listed addresses for Northeast [REDACTED] Avenue and Southeast [REDACTED] Street address in Ocala, Florida. In February 2016, the AOJ mailed notice that it had ordered VA examinations to the Northeast [REDACTED] Street address, which was returned as undeliverable due to "NO SUCH NUMBER" the following month. 

The claims file shows a CLEAR report again identified the North [REDACTED] Avenue apartment address as the Veteran's then-current address. See April 2016 Correspondence. 

The AOJ mailed the notice of the April 2016 rating decision to the Northeast [REDACTED] Street address, which was returned as undeliverable, "UNABLE TO FORWARD." See April 2016 Notification; May 2016 Returned Mail. 

In June 2016, the AOJ mailed the notice of the April 2016 rating decision to a Northeast [REDACTED] Street address in Ocala, Florida, which was returned as undeliverable. See June 2016 Correspondence. 

About a week later, VA received notice that the Veteran had appointed a new representative based in Colorado. See July 2016 VA Form 21-22. The filings included an executed VA Form 21-0966 (compensation benefits) and VA Form 21-4138. In the lay statement, he listed multiple physical problems, including "low back scoliosis and pinched nerves" and that he "cannot look up without severe pain in my neck." 

The Board does not find the July 2016 lay statement to be new and material evidence, nor is it a new application, as to the claims for a back disability, neck disability, or upper extremity radiculopathy. The Veteran's representative argues that VA was required to respond to the July 2016 VA Form 21-4138 submission and, until it issued a decision addressing whether the evidence was new and material, these claims remained open. See July 2024 CAVC Decision; citing Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1407 (Fed.  Cir. 2014). 

The Board is unpersuaded by the representative's argument. The submission in question was received in July 2016. For reasons unclear to the Board, the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-0966 outlining his intent to file an application for compensation benefits within 1 calendar year. Neither he nor his then-representative submitted a complete application on an approved form, such as VA Form 21-526EZ or 21-526b. The regulations clearly require all applications filed on and after March 24, 2015, be on a standardized form. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151. Here, the Veteran did not submit an application on a standardized form until August 2018. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (2016). 

Moreover, the July 2016 statement includes no new or material evidence as to the claims of service connection for a back disability, neck disability, or upper extremity radiculopathy. The statement is merely a restatement of the Veteran's original assertions that he has current disabilities related to his low back, neck, and upper extremity radiculopathy and that the disabilities are related to his active service in general.

In terms of the presumption of regularity, the Board finds the presumption has been rebutted but that the Veteran (and his representative at the time) were in actual receipt of the April 2016 rating decision. The Veteran's representative argues that the claims file shows that the AOJ did not mail the original April 2016 notice of rating decision to the Veteran's last known address, or subsequent mailings of the notice. See July 2022 Court Documents; see also June 2019 Third Party Correspondence; July 2024 CAVC Decision. The representative argues the fact that the Veteran moved from Florida to Colorado is evidence that he never received the notification letter and that he was aware these claims had been denied when he executed the July 2016 VA Form 21-4138. He also testified to such at the March 2021 Board hearing. See also March 2021 Hearing Transcript.

The claims file clearly shows the Veteran reported multiple addresses while his May 2015 applications were pending. It shows the Veteran did not disclose he was living in an apartment complex, which lead to some correspondences being returned as undeliverable. Though VA is not obligated to "turn up heaven and earth to find" a veteran, it is required to timely update a veteran's address and correct an address if an error is discovered, such as when mail is returned undeliverable. See M21-1MR Part III, Subpart ii.1.B.8.c (2014); Hyson v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 262, 265 (1993). Here, the AOJ performed queries in December 2015 and April 2016 but did not update the Veteran's address timely. See December 2015 Web/HTML Documents; April 2016 Correspondence. The Veteran's address was also not immediately updated when VA received the July 2016 VA Forms 21-0966 and 21-22. 

However, the claims file indicates the July 2016 correspondence was actually received by the Veteran. Though mailed to an old address, it was not returned as undeliverable. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's testimony that he did not receive the April 2016 notification letter and was never aware that it was denied. See March 2021 Hearing Transcript. However, the Veteran's actions suggest otherwise. He identified claims of service connection for back/spine and PTSD in his August 2018 application for disability compensation. See August 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ. The inclusion of these disabilities suggests he was aware that his prior claims had been denied in general. 

VA did not receive an application for compensation benefits within one year of the April 2016 rating decision. The July 2016 intent to file "lapsed" when VA did not receive an application within 1 year. VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ in August 2018 following a May 2018 intent to file. The May 2018 intent to file was received almost 2 years after the April 2016 rating decision had been remailed and not returned undeliverable. Thus, the April 2016 rating decision became final.

The Board also finds no reason to reopen the claims under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). The Veteran provided partial copies of his STRs that were previously added to his claims file prior to the April 2016 rating decision. See August 2018 Medical Treatment Records. The record does not suggest new pertinent STRs or personnel records were in VA's possession but added to the claims file after the April 2016 rating decision to warrant reopening the earlier rating decision. 

Thus, with respect to the Veteran's claims of service connection and ultimate award of service connection for the back disability and neck disability with upper extremity radiculopathy, the April 2016 rating decision was final. The Veteran had actual notice of the April 2016 rating decision, and new and material evidence as to these claims had not been received within 1 year of the rating decision, including remailing of the rating decision in July 2016. The claims for an effective date earlier than May 25, 2018, for these claims are denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 25, 2018, for a TDIU rating is remanded.

The Board finds the issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 25, 2018, for a TDIU rating is inextricably intertwined with the Veteran's claim for earlier effective dates for the awards of PTSD and migraine headaches awarded herein. The Board, thus, cannot adjudicate this matter until the AOJ has assigned new effective dates for the initial awards of these service-connected disabilities. See Harris, 1 Vet. App. at 183

Additionally, a remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the issuance of the September 2021 rating decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 20.802.

When determining whether a veteran is unemployable for VA purposes, an individualized determination specific to a veteran's particular circumstances must be made. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). In Ray v. Wilkie, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held there are two components when analyzing whether a TDIU rating is warranted: an economic component and a noneconomic component. Ray, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). When analyzing the noneconomic component, the factfinder must consider the following: (1) the veteran's history, education, skill, and training; (2) whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and (3) whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue. Id. The veteran's age and any impairment related solely to a nonservice-connected disability are not to be considered. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524 (1993) (the central inquiry in determining whether a veteran is entitled to a TDIU is whether the service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability).

VA will not consider marginal employment, i.e., annual earnings that do not exceed the poverty threshold amount for one person as established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, as substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. When looking at unemployability, a veteran may still be deemed unemployable during a period of occasional, intermittent, tryout, or unsuccessful employment or when terminated on account of a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.18.

In this case, VA failed to develop the first sub-component of the TDIU analysis - the Veteran's work history, education, skill, and training. In the May 2015 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran stated that he last worked on a full-time basis in March 2011 (when he separated from active service) and that he became too disabled to work in May 2015. He provided no additional details regarding his work history. In his April 2019 application, he noted he worked as a caregiver through a Colorado business between 2012 and 2016 (though the record suggests he was residing in Florida during this period) and as a barback between 2016 and 2018. The Board finds further clarification about the Veteran's work history and income is needed before the Board can decide whether a TDIU rating prior to August 25, 2018, is warranted. 

Upon remand, the AOJ will contact the Veteran and request he provide a complete account of his post-service work history and income-related information for each identified occupation. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1.	Ask the Veteran to provide a statement describing post-military work activities and any earning-related documentation, to include copies of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) personal tax returns between 2015 and 2018.

2.	If needed, request the Veteran's earnings history from the Social Security Administration.
