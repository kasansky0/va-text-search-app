ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 13, 2021, for service connection of a headache disability is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 23, 2023, for service connection of a residuals of traumatic brain injury (TBI) disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On August 13, 2021, the Veteran filed a valid intent to file (ITF).  On August 12, 2022, the Veteran submitted a valid claim for service connection for a headache disability resulting from a fall injury in service.  On February 8, 2023, a rating decision was issued establishing service connection for a headache disability effective August 13, 2021, based on the date the Veteran's ITF was received.

2. On February 23, 2023, the Veteran filed a claim for increased rating for a headache disability.  A May 2023 rating decision established service connection for a residuals of traumatic brain injury (TBI) disability effective February 23, 2023, pursuant to that claim for increase.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 13, 2021, for service connection for a headache disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.114, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 23, 2023, for service connection for a residuals of traumatic brain injury (TBI) disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.114, 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in July 1995 with additional National Guard service.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February 2023 and May 2023 rating decisions issued by a Regional Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In February 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) appealing February 2023 and October 2023 rating decisions and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 and May 2023 AOJ decisions on appeal.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran wants VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify that evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the February 2024 Form 10182 listed the issue as earlier effective date for neurological residuals of slip-and-fall from February 2023 and October 2023 rating decisions.  The February 8, 2023, rating decision established service connection for migraines as relating to a slip-and-fall injury in service.  However, the October 2023 assigned an increased rating for a TBI residuals disability and did not establish service connection for any other neurological disability pertaining to the slip-and-fall injury.  A May 12, 2023, rating decision actually established service connection for that TBI disability.  Accordingly, in interpreting the claim most favorably to the Veteran, the Board finds that the 10182 seeks earlier effective dates for service connection for a headache disability from the February 7, 2023, rating decision and for TBI residuals, for which service connection was established in a May 12, 2023, rating decision.

Effective Dates

The general rule regarding the assignment of effective date for an award based on an original claim for VA benefits is that the effective date shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  One exception to the general rule applies if an application for benefits is received within one year from the date of separation from active service, and an award is made on the basis of that application.  In that limited situation, the effective date of the award is the day following the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  Otherwise, the effective date will be the later of the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Another exception to the general rule regarding assignment of effective date may apply when there is a change in law.  If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of VA within one year from the effective date of the law or VA issue, or at the request of a claimant received within one year from that date, benefits may be authorized from the effective date of the law or VA issue.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

An exception to the general rule is also available for claims for increase where evidence of record shows that an increase in disability occurred within a one-year period preceding receipt of the claim for increase.  An effective date for a claim for increase shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within one year from that date.  When medical records indicate an increase in a disability, receipt of medical records may be used to establish effective dates for retroactive benefits based on facts found of an increase in a disability only if a complete claim or intent to file a claim for an increase is received within one year of the date of the report of examination, hospitalization, or medical treatment.  The provisions of this paragraph apply only when the reports relate to examination or treatment of a disability for which service-connection has previously been established.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

A claimant, a duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of claimant who is not of full age or capacity may indicate a claimant's desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  On receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Earlier effective dates may be warranted for claims that have been continuously pursued.  38 C.F.R. §3.2500.  A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the following administrative review options, as specified, after any decision by the agency of original jurisdiction, Board of Veterans' Appeals, or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, provided that any appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is timely filed as determined by the court:  (1) Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals;  (2) Following notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  (3) Following notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  (4) Following a decision on an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the claimant may file a supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. §3.2500(c).

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. §3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision, provided that any appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must be accepted as timely by that court.  38 C.F.R. §3.2500(h).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 13, 2021, for service connection of a headache disability.

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for service connection for a headache disability.

The Veteran previously filed a valid intent to file a claim (ITF) on May 13, 2020.  A second ITF was submitted on May 18, 2020, but had no effect because the May 13, 2020, ITF was still active.  No claim was received within one year of the May 13, 2020, ITF, or the May 18, 2020, attempted ITF and therefore the ITF expired. 

 On August 13, 2021, the Veteran filed a valid VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC (ITF).  On August 12, 2022, within one year of the ITF, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits seeking to establish service connection for headaches as caused by a head injury from a slip-and-fall during training.  A February 8, 2023, rating decision established service connection for migraines effective August 13, 2021, based on the date that VA received the Veteran's valid ITF with a claim received within one year of the valid ITF.

The Board has considered whether there is any basis for an earlier effective date for a headache disability but does not find any basis for an earlier effective date.  The August 12, 2022, claim for service connection was the first claim for benefits that the Veteran filed with VA, and there is no procedural history or previous claims that could provide a basis for an earlier effective date.  The AOJ properly assigned an effective date based on the August 12, 2022, ITF that was still active when the Veteran's August 12, 2022, claim was received, and previous ITF submissions had expired or were invalid and therefore cannot form the basis of an earlier effective date either.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim for an earlier effective date for service connection.  The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran.  Therefore, the appeal with respect to this issue must be denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection of a residuals of traumatic brain injury (TBI) disability.

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for TBI residuals on the basis of continuous pursuit since an August 13, 2021, intent to file.

Service connection was established for a headache disability in a February 8, 2023, AOJ rating decision.  On February 23, 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, along with a statement seeking an increased rating for the headache disability related to a head injury in service.  A May 2023 rating decision established service connection and assigned a separate rating for residuals of traumatic brain injury to include visual and mental impairment and dizziness effective February 23, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's VA Form 526EZ.  The Board notes that the May 2023 rating decision deferred the assignment of a final disability rating for the TBI residuals disability pending further examination.  An October 2023 rating decision assigned a 100 percent rating for TBI residuals.

The Board finds that the Veteran's February 23, 2023, claim for increase gave rise to the issue of service connection or a separate rating for the TBI residuals disability.  After service connection was established for a headache disability, the Veteran then filed a new claim for increase.  If one of the review options had been used to seek an increased rating for the headache disability, continuous pursuit might have been preserved.  Instead, a new claim for increase was filed.  As discussed above, continuous pursuit requires use of one of the available review options and the TBI residuals disability originated with the new claim for increase rather than any request for review.  Though the February 2024 VA Form 10182 raises the issue of earlier effective dates for disabilities from two appeal streams and preserves continuous pursuit of those issues, it does not somehow merge or connect the two appeal streams.  Therefore, service connection for a TBI residuals disability has been continuously pursued since it arose in the February 23, 2023, claim for increase but not prior to that date.

Additionally, the Board has considered whether the evidence shows that an increase in disability occurred within one-year prior to receipt of the claim for increase, as an earlier effective date might be possible under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  However, the weight of the evidence does not show that such an increase occurred within one year prior to receipt of the February 23, 2023, claim for increase.  Therefore, the Board finds that an earlier effective date under the rules for claims for increase under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o) is not warranted.

A March 2023 VA examination yielded a diagnosis of TBI residuals.  Prior to that point, the weight of the evidence did not show a TBI residuals disability, other than the already service-connected headache disability.  The Board finds that the weight of the evidence does not show that entitlement arose prior to February 23, 2023.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim for an earlier effective date for service connection for TBI residuals.  The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran.  Therefore, the appeal with respect to this issue must be denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
