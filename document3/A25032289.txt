ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for diabetes mellitus type II is granted from June 29, 2012.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for ischemic heart disease is granted from June 29, 2012.

Entitlement to a 30 percent rating, but no higher, is granted for ischemic heart disease.  

Entitlement to an increased rating higher than 20 percent for diabetes mellitus is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus was received on June 29, 2012.  A November 2013 rating decision denied service connection for diabetes mellitus.  New and material evidence was received within one year of the rating decision.

2. A claim for service connection for ischemic heart disease was received on June 29, 2012.  A November 2013 rating decision denied service connection for ischemic heart disease.  New and material evidence was received within one year of the rating decision.

3. The evidence is at least evenly balanced that the Veteran served at or near the perimeter of Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand from September 1969 to April 1970 where he was exposed to herbicide agents.

4. The evidence shows that a METs level of 3 to 5 results in angina, dizziness, or syncope.

5. During the appeal period, diabetes mellitus required treatment with an oral agent and insulin but did not require regulation of activities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date for service connection for service connection for diabetes mellitus are met from June 29, 2012. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date for service connection for service connection for ischemic heart disease are met from June 29, 2012. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

3. The criteria for a 30 percent rating, but no higher, for ischemic heart disease are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110, 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, Diagnostic Code 7005.

4. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1972 to August 1991.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 18, 2024.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or representative, at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Date Criteria

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increased, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran is the day following the date of discharge or release if the application therefor is received within one year from such date of discharge or release.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1).

A claim is defined as a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  The amendments apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by VA.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by VA, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  An intent to file a claim can be submitted in one of three ways, including a saved electronic application.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1). When an application otherwise meeting the requirements of this paragraph (b) is electronically initiated and saved in a claims-submission tool within a VA web-based electronic claims application system prior to filing of a complete claim, VA will consider that application to be an intent to file a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1)(i).

The Court has made it clear that the date of the filing of a claim is controlling in determinations as to effective dates. A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a).

For continuously pursued claims, except as otherwise provided by other provisions of this part, including § 3.400, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision, provided that any appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must be accepted as timely by that court. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  Except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision or the Board issued notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

Service connection may be established on a presumptive basis for certain disabilities resulting from exposure to an herbicide agent.  Those diseases include diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, Public Law No.117-168 was enacted on August 10, 2022.  The PACT Act expanded veterans' disability benefits, including provisions relevant to claims for service connection for disabilities due to herbicide exposure.  The PACT Act expanded the presumption of exposure to herbicides to veterans who served in Thailand.  The PACT Act added hypertension as a condition that is presumptively associated with herbicide exposure.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for diabetes mellitus type II 

The May 2023 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for diabetes mellitus from August 10, 2022.  The effective date was based on the date of enactment of the PACT Act, which expanded that presumption of herbicide exposure to veterans who served at Royal Thai air bases during the Vietnam era.  The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date of service connection.  He contends that service connection is warranted on a direct basis prior to August 10, 2022.  

A claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus type II was initially received on June 29, 2012.  A November 2013 rating decision denied service connection for diabetes mellitus.  The Veteran submitted evidence within a year of the rating decision.  That evidence included a lay statement alleging that his military occupational specialty involved working on the perimeter at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base.  

New and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim that was pending at the beginning of the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  When evidence is added to the file within the appellate period, the finality of the decision is tolled until there has been a determination as to whether that evidence is new and material.  See Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1407 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2011).

The RO considered the evidence in a February 2015 rating decision continued to deny service connection for diabetes mellitus type II.  The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement with the rating decision in January 2016.  The AOJ did not issue an SOC in response to the notice of disagreement.  In February 2019, the Veteran submitted a claim to reopen service connection for diabetes mellitus.  A May 2023 rating decision granted service connection for diabetes mellitus from August 10, 2022.  

The Board finds that the initial June 2012 claim did not become final because the Veteran submitted new and material evidence within one year of the rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  The Veteran timely appealed the February 2015 rating decision that stemmed from the claim that was still pending from June 2012. 

In a March 2014 statement, the Veteran contended that he regularly loaded C-130 aircraft and that his duties included being stationed on the end of the runway near areas of Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base that had been treated with defoliants.   See March 3/30/14 Statement.  

For claims prior to the PACT Act, exposure to herbicides may be established on a factual basis for veterans whose duties placed them on or near the perimeters of certain Thailand bases.  See Stover v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 394 (2022).  Prior to the enactment of the PACT Act, VBA guidance provided that herbicide exposure may be conceded on a direct/facts-found basis if the Veteran served with the U.S. Air Force in Thailand during the Vietnam Era at one of the Royal Thai Air Force Bases (RTAFBs) at U-Tapao, Ubon, Nakhon Phanom, Udorn, Takhli, Korat, or Don Muang, and as an Air Force security policeman, security patrol dog handler, member of the security police squadron, or otherwise near the air base perimeter as shown by evidence of daily work duties, performance evaluation reports, or other credible evidence.  In a May 2010 bulletin, VA's C&P Service indicated that it had determined that there was significant use of herbicides on the fenced in perimeters of military bases in Thailand intended to eliminate vegetation and ground cover for base security purposes.  VA determined that there was significant use of herbicides on the fenced-in perimeters of military bases in Thailand intended to eliminate vegetation and ground cover for base security purposes, as evidenced in a declassified Vietnam era Department of Defense document titled "Project CHECO Southeast Asia Report: Base Defense in Thailand."  Special consideration of herbicide exposure on a facts-found or direct basis should be extended to those Veterans whose duties placed them on or near the perimeters of Thailand military bases. That allows for presumptive service connection of the diseases associated with herbicide exposure.  See VBA guidance document.

An individual who performed service in the Air Force or Air Force Reserve under circumstances in which the individual regularly and repeatedly operated, maintained, or served on C-123 aircraft known to have been used to spray an herbicide in Vietnam shall be presumed to have been exposed to such agent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(v).

The Court in Parseeya-Picchione v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 171, 177 (2016), held that the Board must consider lay, historical, and archival evidence, in addition to service records, in determining whether there was service in Vietnam or exposure to herbicide agents elsewhere.  The Board finds the Veteran's statements about his service duties including being on the runway near the perimeter of the base credible.  Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 363 (2005).   

Therefore, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's duties at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base placed him at or near the air base perimeter.  The evidence of record shows that the Veteran served at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand from September 1969 to April 1970, and his duties included work at or near the air base perimeter.  Accordingly, exposure to Agent Orange is established on a direct facts-found basis.  As the claim was pending from June 29, 2012, an earlier effective date for service connection for diabetes mellitus is warranted from June 29, 2012.   38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for ischemic heart disease

The May 2023 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for ischemic heart disease from August 10, 2022.  The effective date was based on the date of enactment of the PACT Act.  The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted on a direct basis prior to August 10, 2022.  

A claim for service connection for ischemic heart disease was initially received on June 29, 2012.  A November 2013 rating decision denied service connection for ischemic heart disease.  The Veteran submitted evidence within a year of the rating decision.  The Veteran submitted new and material evidence within one year of the November 2013 rating decision, including a March 2014 lay statement.  

As indicated above, the Board finds that the initial June 2012 claim did not become final because the Veteran submitted new and material evidence within one year of the rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  The Veteran timely appealed the February 2015 rating decision that stemmed from the claim that had been pending from June 2012.

Additionally, as described above, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran was exposed to herbicides during his duties at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base while working near the perimeter of the base.  See Parseeya-Picchione and Washington, supra. 

Therefore, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran served at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand from September 1969 to April 1970, and his duties included work at or near the air base perimeter.  Accordingly, exposure to Agent Orange is established on a direct facts-found basis.  An earlier effective date for service connection for ischemic heart disease is warranted from June 29, 2012.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Increased rating 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial ratings assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999). Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Entitlement to an increased rating for ischemic heart disease 

The May 2023 rating decision granted service connection for ischemic heart disease and assigned a 10 percent rating from August 10, 2022.  The Veteran contends that a higher initial rating is warranted.   The 10 percent rating was based on a finding of a workload of 7 to 10 METs resulting in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope and the need for continuous medication required for control.  

The Veteran's ischemic heart disease is rated under 38 C.F.R.§ 4.71a, DC 7005.

Effective November 14, 2021, VA revised the criteria for evaluating cardiovascular disorders.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: The Cardiovascular System, 38 C.F.R. § 4.104 (Nov. 14, 2021). Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria from that date.  The version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110.

Under the criteria of Diagnostic Code 7005 in effect prior to November 14, 2021, a 30 percent rating is assigned for documented coronary artery disease when a workload of greater than 5 METs but not greater than 7 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram or x-ray.

A 60 percent rating is assigned for documented coronary artery disease resulting in more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year, or; workload of greater than 3 METs but not greater than 5 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for documented coronary artery disease resulting in: chronic congestive heart failure, or; workload of 3 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent.

Effective November 14, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Codes 7005 and 7006, arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and/or myocardial infarction residuals are rated in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart.

A 10 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 7.1-10.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or continuous medication is required for control.

A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multigated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging).

A 60 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms.

A 100 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.

Under the post-amendment rating criteria, one MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2).  When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms may be used.  Id.

For purposes of the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart, heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (3).

Under both the pre- and post-amendment criteria, for myocardial infarction (DC 7006), a 100 percent evaluation is assigned during and for three months following myocardial infarction, confirmed by laboratory tests.  Thereafter, under the post-amendment criteria, the General Rating Formula is to be applied, as described above.

A May 2023 VA examination noted that continuous medication for CAD includes aspirin.  The VA examiner noted there was no history of myocardial infarction.  VA examination noted interview-based METs level of 5-7 results in fatigue.  The activity level was noted to be consistent with activities such as walking 1 flight of stairs, golfing (without cart), mowing lawn (push mower), and heavy yard work (digging).  The VA examiner noted that an exercise-based stress test was not completed.  The examiner noted that the Veteran reported that he was active with some fatigue with moderate exercise.  

The VA examination worksheet describes the METs level of 3-5 METs consistent with activities such as light yard work (weeding), mowing lawn (power mower), or brisk walking (4 mph).  The METs level of 1-3 is consistent with activities such as eating, dressing, taking a shower, and slow walking (2 mph) for 1-2 blocks.  

During his Board hearing, the Veteran testified that it takes two hours for him to mow his lawn and that he takes quite a few breaks. He also testified that he bowls and take breaks.  

The Board does not discount the ameliorative effects of medication because the plain language of the rating criteria contemplates the effects of continuous medication in assigning a 10 percent disability rating.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012) (holding that the ameliorative effects of medication may not be considered in assigning a disability rating where these effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria).

A veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007)

The Veteran's testimony described an activity level of mowing the lawn at a slow pace and bowling with breaks, which is a lower level of activity than described in the 2023 VA examination report.  The Board finds the Veteran competent to report activity levels that cause breathlessness and fatigue.  Considering the examination and the Veteran's testimony, the Board finds that the activity level consistent with activities such as light yard work (weeding), mowing lawn (power mower), or brisk walking (4 mph) resulting in fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope.  The Veteran's described activity level is most consistent with a METs level of 3-5, involving activity such as light yard work.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for a METs level of 3-5.  His testimony reflects a higher level of activity than is contemplated by a 60 percent rating.  He did not indicate that he experiences breathlessness, fatigue, or syncope with activities such as eating, bathing, or slow walking.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran has not described an activity level consistent with a METs level of 1-3, with activities such as eating, dressing, taking a shower, and slow walking (2 mph) for 1-2 blocks resulting in breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope.  

Therefore, the Board finds that a rating higher than 30 percent is not warranted, as there is no evidence indicating that a VA examiner found, or that the Veteran reported, an activity level consistent with a METs level of 1-3 resulting in breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope.  38 C.F.R. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

Increased rating for diabetes mellitus

Diabetes mellitus is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, DC 7913.  Under DC 7913, a 20 percent rating is assigned for diabetes when it requires insulin and a restricted diet, or; oral hypoglycemic agent and a restricted diet.  A 40 percent rating is assigned for diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated.  A 100 percent rating is warranted for diabetes mellitus requiring more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus either progressive loss of weight and strength or complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated.  38 C.F.R. § 4.119, DC 7913.

Note (1), following the rating criteria, indicates that compensable complications from diabetes mellitus are evaluated separately unless they are part of the criteria used to support a 100 percent rating. Noncompensable complications are considered part of the diabetic process under DC 7913.

The term "regulation of activities" is specifically defined as "avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities" with the intention of avoiding hypoglycemic episodes.  See Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 363-364 (2007).  Medical evidence is required to support this criterion; a medical provider must indicate that the claimant's "diabetes is of such severity that he should curtail his activities such as to avoid strenuous activity."  Id.

The rating criteria for diabetes are "successive," which exist when the evaluation for each higher rating includes the criteria of each lower rating, so that if a component is not met at any level, the Veteran can only be rated at the level that does not require the missing component.  Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152, 156 (2008).  For example, the 10 percent evaluation for diabetes mellitus requires a restricted diet; the 20 percent evaluation requires a restricted diet and insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent; the 40 percent evaluation requires insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities; and so forth.  Camacho, 21 Vet. App. at 366.

The August 2023 rating decision granted an initial 20 percent rating for diabetes mellitus from August 10, 2022.  The Veteran contends that a higher rating is warranted.  At the December 2024 hearing, he testified that he takes Metformin for treatment of diabetes.

An October 2013 VA examination noted that the Veteran did not require regulation of activities as part of medical management of diabetes mellitus.  He had fewer than 2 visits a month to diabetic care provider for ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia. Veteran did not have hospitalizations for ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia in last 12 months.  The VA examination noted the Veteran did not have complications of diabetes mellitus.  The VA examination indicated that the Veteran did not have progressive unintentional weight loss and loss of strength attributable to diabetes mellitus

An April 2023 VA examination noted that diabetes is managed by oral hypoglycemic agent and does not require regulation of activities.  The VA examination indicated that the Veteran sees a diabetic care provider for episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia less than 2 times per month.  The Veteran did not require hospitalization for ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reaction in the past 12 months.  He did not have progressive unintentional weight loss and loss of strength attributable to diabetes mellitus.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran did not have complications due to diabetes mellitus. 

The Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively against the assignment of a rating higher than 20 percent for diabetes mellitus. During the appeal, the Veteran was treated with insulin and an oral agent, but he did not require regulation of activities. There is no evidence from a medical provider showing that the Veteran is required to curtail his activities due to diabetes mellitus.  Therefore, an initial rating higher than 20 percent is not warranted. Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence is neither approximately balanced nor nearly equal with regard to whether a rating higher than 20 percent is warranted. As the evidence persuasively weighs against a rating higher than 20 percent, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply.  38 C.F.R. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
