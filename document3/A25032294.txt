ORDER

Service-connection for right foot strain status post plantar wart removal is granted. 

REMANDED

Service-connection for right foot strain is remanded. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right foot strain status post plantar wart removal had its onset during his active service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for right foot strain status post plantar wart removal are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from February 1975 until his honorable discharge February 1979.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a June 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). That June 2023 rating decision was a higher-level review (HLR) decision issued following a November 2022 rating decision.

Given the date of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's appeal is governed by the modernized review system, known by the Board as the AMA.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2. 

On his Notice of Disagreement to the Board, the Veteran selected the direct docket.  Accordingly, the Board may only review evidence of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claim of service-connection for right foot strain status post plantar wart removal, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As the Board is remanding the claim of service-connection for right foot strain for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of those claims.

Service-connection for right foot strain status post plantar wart removal.

The Veteran is seeking service-connection for his right foot condition. See December 2019 VA 21-526EZ, June 2019 VA 20-0995, September 2022 VA 20-0996, June 2024 VA 10182, and June 2024 Third Party Correspondence. More specifically, the Veteran is seeking service-connection for two distinct disabilities in his right foot, right foot strain and right foot strain status post plantar wart removal.  See June 2024 Third Party Correspondence. The Board first considers service-connection for the Veteran's right foot strain status post plantar wart removal. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that began during active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

The RO made favorable findings that the Veteran has current diagnoses of right foot strain and right foot strain status post plantar wart removal, that the Veteran's disease had its onset during service as he was treated during service for right foot plantar warts, right great toe, and right foot pain. See June 2023 Rating Decision-Narrative. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board finds that the first two elements of entitlement to service-connection for right foot strain and right foot strain status post plantar wart removal are met. 

Thus, the question becomes whether the Veteran's current disability is related to his active service. 

The Veteran was provided with an examination in connection with his claim. See August 2021 VA Examination and February 2023 VA Examination. In the August 2021 VA examination and medical opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's right foot condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by his military service because the examiner did not identify any treatment records for a right foot condition within the 307 pages of records that were provided. The Veteran sought HLR and his claim was returned for a new examination because the examiner stated there was no confirmed diagnosis which contradicted medical records and the RO considered that the examiner did not have complete service treatment records (STR). See September 2022 VA 20-0996 and November 2022 VA 20-0999. In the February 2023 VA examination, the examiner identified the Veteran's diagnosis as right foot strain status post plantar wart removal. In the examination report, the examiner wrote that the Veteran's condition began while he was in the military. In the opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed condition was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The rationale was that the Veteran's STR included treatment for plantar wart and was diagnosed with right foot pain and treated while on active duty. The Board finds the February 2023 VA examination and opinion on which it has relied to be both adequate and probative with regard to the Veteran's claim for service-connection for right foot strain status post plantar wart removal.  The examination report included a recitation of the Veteran's medical history, including that related by the Veteran.  The examination report and opinion provided sufficient information to allow the Board to make an informed decision, and it contained a reasoned explanation supporting the examiner's conclusions.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current right foot strain status post plantar wart removal arose in service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service-connection for right foot strain status post plantar wart removal is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service-connection for right foot strain. 

As stated above the Veteran has a separate diagnosis of right foot strain and is seeking service-connection for right foot strain apart from the right foot strain status post plantar wart removal. See June 2023 Rating Decision, June 2021 VA 21-4138, June 2024 VA 10182 and June 2024 Third Party Correspondence. 

The Veteran was afforded an examination in connection with his claim for service-connection for his right foot strain status post plantar wart removal. See February 2023 VA Examination. With regard to the Veteran's claimed right foot strain, without relationship to his plantar wart removal, the February 2023 VA Examination is inadequate. 

The Veteran submitted his original claim for service-connection for his right foot in December 2019 and described it as "right foot condition." In a December 2019 statement, the Veteran stated that he experienced trauma to his right foot after which he was put on light duty. He continues to experience pain in his right foot. In this statement, the Veteran did not attribute his right foot condition to his plantar wart removal. 

Medical evidence suggests that the Veteran has a right foot strain separate from his right foot strain status post plantar wart removal. In a private medical opinion, APRN GU described the Veteran's right foot condition as a muscle strain. See June 2021 Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility. In a June 2023 VA addendum opinion, the examiner stated that the Veteran's right foot status post plantar wart removal was a separate diagnosis that was unrelated to the Veteran's foot strain. 

The Board is required to consider all theories of entitlement to VA benefits that are either raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?45, 53 (2011) ("[T]he Secretary generally must investigate the reasonably apparent and potential causes of the Veteran's condition and theories of service connection that are reasonably raised by the record or raised by a sympathetic reading of the claimant's filing."). In this case, it is raised by the record that the Veteran has two distinct disabilities related to his "right foot condition," right foot strain and right foot strain status post plantar wart removal. As the Veteran has been granted service-connection for right foot strain status post plantar wart removal, and there is evidence that the Veteran has a second separate right foot disability, the issue of service-connection for right foot strain is raised by the record and remains undecided. 

Failure to decide the Veteran's claim for service-connection for right foot strain separate from right foot strain status post plantar wart removal is a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand is necessary. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action: 

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his right foot strain, unrelated to his right foot strain status post plantar wart removal. The entire claim file, to include all electronic files, must be reviewed by the examiner.   

The examiner is to state whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's right foot strain, unrelated to his right foot strain status post plantar wart removal is related to his active service.
