REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from March 1972 to December 1975. The Board recognizes the Veteran's service to his country and the sacrifices it entailed. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying service connection for vertigo, COPD, and left ear hearing loss disabilities and granting service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis disability with an evaluation of 10 percent. 

The Board observes the Veteran referred to an August 2023 rating decision in his appeal, but that rating decision was the subject of a higher-level review that resulted in the June 2024 decision. Therefore, the Veteran's appeal is timely.

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on March 28, 2025.

Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 and October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and before the Board hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

The hearing transcript will be associated with the claims file, but the Veteran qualified for expedited processing, and therefore, this decision is being written prior to the creation of an actual transcript. References to the "transcript" herein are based on the events of the hearing as expected to be reflected in the transcript when it is completed.

1. From May 8, 2023, entitlement to a TDIU is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a total disability rating. See Hearing Transcript.

While the Veteran did not file an application for a TDIU, the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for his left knee disability, included an implied claim for TDIU. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. A total disability rating for compensation purposes may be assigned on the basis of individual unemployability when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In such an instance, if there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and additional disability must bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id.

In adjudicating the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, the Board must evaluate whether there are circumstances in the Veteran's case, apart from any non-service-connected conditions and advancing age, that would justify a TDIU. The Veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue must be addressed.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted from May 8, 2023.

From May 8, 2023, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities include lower back degenerative arthritis, cervical intervertebral disc syndrome, right upper extremity radiculopathy, left upper extremity radiculopathy, left lower extremity radiculopathy, bilateral tinnitus, left knee degenerative arthritis, right ear hearing loss, healed perforations of tympanic membranes, and lumbar laminectomy scar. His combined rating is 80 percent. Accordingly, the Veteran meets the schedular requirements for a TDIU. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In terms of the Veteran's educational background, the record shows the Veteran has a college education. As far as his work history, after service, the Veteran worked as an educator and as a contractor for the Department of Defense. The Veteran reported that he stopped working in 2009 because of his service connected disabilities. See August 2010 VA Form 21-8940; Hearing Transcript.

Regarding the impact of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities on his employment, the Board finds that the VA examinations are highly probative.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2018 for his bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy. The examiner concluded that the Veteran should avoid work involving manipulation of small objects or carrying heavy weights. See July 2018 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his lower back degenerative arthritis in June 2023. The examiner noted that it is very difficult for the Veteran to move from sitting to standing position without using both arms to do so: one to push off the chair he is seated on and the second to grab onto a table of the examiner to pull himself up to a standing position. The examiner also noted the Veteran has lower extremity radiculopathy, which results in further functional limitations. See June 2023 DBQ.

At the hearing, the Veteran testified that his tinnitus, hearing loss, and pain from his musculoskeletal service-connected disabilities, causes difficulty concentrating and focusing on tasks, as well as impeding his ability to communicate with customers or co-workers. See Hearing Transcript.

With respect to whether the Veteran is unemployable, the Board finds the record supports a finding that he is unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment. This is evident from the VA examinations, in which the examiners noted significant physical limitations that are consistent with less than sedentary work. 

The Board also notes that in a December 2010 decision, the Social Security Administration found the Veteran was disabled under the Social Security Act. The decision noted the Veteran was limited to less than the full range of sedentary work based solely on his lower back disability. While this decision is not binding, the Board finds it to be persuasive. 

There is no definition of "sedentary employment" universally applicable to VA disability cases. Thus, in each case, the Board must use its reasoned judgment to define the term. See Withers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 139 (2018) (stating VA does not define "sedentary employment" in its regulations for TDIU benefits; thus, the Board must determine the meaning on a case-by-case basis).

The Board finds guidance offered by the Department of Labor useful. The Department of Labor states that sedentary work involves exerting up to 10 pounds of force occasionally ("occasionally" meaning only up to one-third of the time) and/or a negligible amount of force frequently ("frequently" meaning between one-and two-thirds of the time) to lift, carry, push, pull, or otherwise move objects, including the human body. Sedentary work involves sitting most of the time but may involve walking or standing for brief periods of time.

Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required only occasionally, and all other sedentary criteria are met. See Department of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles, Appendix C.IV.c, available at http://www.occupationalinfo.org/appendxc_1.html#STRENGTH (last visited April 2, 2025).

Here, the Veteran's symptomatology, as outlined above, includes difficulty sitting, standing, carrying objects, walking, communicating, and concentrating. The Veteran also has difficulty manipulating small objects. 

Thus, even at the sedentary level (which requires manipulating small objects and the ability to concentrate to complete tasks), the Veteran would have difficulty completing a full workday. As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's combined symptoms from his disabilities render him unable to obtain and retain skilled employment and render him unable to safely perform the tasks of unskilled labor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. Accordingly, the Board finds a TDIU is warranted.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee degenerative arthritis is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his authorized representative. Id.

Here, at the Board hearing on March 28, 2025, the Veteran submitted a request to withdraw his appeal of the 10 percent disability rating assigned to his left knee degenerative arthritis. See Hearing Transcript. 

The Veteran's request was clear and unequivocal, and the Veteran and his representative affirmed their understanding of the implications of withdrawing an appeal.  As such, the request to withdraw was valid under 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 and DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011).

Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal of the 10 percent disability rating for left knee degenerative arthritis is dismissed.

3. Service connection for vertigo is granted.

The Veteran contends that his vertigo disability is related to service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his vertigo disability is related to injuries he sustained during a diving incident while in service. Alternatively, the Veteran contends that his vertigo disability is secondary to his service-connected right ear hearing loss disability. See May 2023 VA Form 20-0995; Hearing Transcript.

The first element of service connection, a current disability is met. The Veteran's treatment notes show a diagnosis of vertigo. See January 2010 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

The second element of service connection is met. In the June 2024 rating decision, the RO conceded that there was an in-service occurrence based on the Veteran's Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) as a diver and a combat engineer. 

The Board further finds the Veteran's current vertigo disability is related to service.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for vertigo in May 2010. The examiner noted that the Veteran's neurologic Romberg test noted increased sway, which is not suggestive of vertigo, therefore, no diagnosis is warranted.  However, the examiner noted the Veteran's symptom of poor balance was at least as likely as not due to noise exposure and repeated inner ear baro-trauma that the Veteran experienced in service. See May 2010 DBQ.

The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination in June 2023. The examiner opined that the claimed condition is less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness because the Veteran does not have a current disability. See June 2023 DBQ.

When adjudicating appeals, the Board applies an intentionally generous standard of proof unique in American jurisprudence, created in recognition of the nation's great debt to its veterans. Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014).

"Reasonable doubt" exists when the evidence does not "satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim." Emphasis added. A veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Thus, when the evidence in favor of the veteran on a given issue is at least nearly equal to the evidence against them, the Board finds in the veteran's favor. See, e.g., Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F.4th 1369, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

In this instance, both VA examiners concluded the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of vertigo. However, this is inconsistent with the Veteran's treatment notes that show a diagnosis of vertigo with difficulty balancing. See CAPRI Records. Moreover, the 2010 examiner concluded that the Veteran's underlying symptoms including difficulty balancing were at least as likely as not due to noise exposure and repeated inner ear baro-trauma that he experienced while in service.

Thus, where the negative nexus opinions are of limited probative value due to inadequate analyses and explanations, there is no evidence of any intervening cause, and the Veteran's contentions are inherently plausible, internally consistent, and uncontroverted by contradictory evidence, the Board finds the benefit of the doubt must be given to the Veteran.

Lay evidence-including post hoc statements from the Veteran-may be sufficient to establish any element of service connection, including the causal nexus between and injury and a disability. See Hearing Transcript; Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for the Veteran's vertigo disability.

The appeal is granted.

4. Service connection for COPD is granted.

The Veteran contends that his COPD disability is related to service to include exposure to toxins while in service. See Hearing Transcript.

The first element of service connection, a current disability is met. In the June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ conceded the Veteran has a current COPD disability. 

The second element of service connection is also met. In the June 2024 rating decision, the RO conceded that the Veteran was exposed to toxins while in service based on his MOS as a diver and a combat engineer. 

The Board further finds the Veteran's current COPD disability is related to service.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2023. The examiner concluded that the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activities. The examiner explained that currently there is no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication of a relationship between the development of the condition at issue and the Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA). There was no mention of respiratory problem on the exit exam and no notation of any shortness of breath until 2013, approximately 38 years after active duty. See October 2023 DBQ.

The Board finds this opinion is inadequate. The examiner notes that the Veteran's condition is not related to service primarily because there is no evidence of chronicity in the record, but the examiner did not address the etiology of the Veteran's condition.

"Reasonable doubt" exists when the evidence does not "satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim." A veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Thus, when the evidence in favor of the veteran on a given issue is at least nearly equal to the evidence against them, the Board finds in the veteran's favor. See Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1961 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

In this instance, the Board notes that the AOJ conceded the Veteran was exposed to toxins while in service. While the VA examiner provided a negative opinion, this opinion was inadequate. The Board also observes the examiner did not directly contradict the Veteran's statements that his symptoms are related to his exposure to toxins, nor did the examiner provide an alternative explanation as to why the Veteran has a current diagnosis of COPD. As such, the benefit of the doubt goes to the Veteran, and the Board finds service connection is warranted.

This appeal is granted.

5. Service connection for left ear hearing loss is granted.

The Veteran contends that his left ear hearing loss is related to acoustic trauma he experienced while in service. Alternatively, the Veteran contends that his left ear hearing loss is secondary to his right ear hearing loss. See May 2023 VA Form 20-0995; Hearing Transcript.

Service connection may be granted for a current disability that began during active duty but was not diagnosed until later. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, to qualify as a disability for VA purposes, the Veteran's hearing loss must meet at least one of the following criteria:

 An auditory threshold of 40 decibels or greater in any of the 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz frequencies;

Auditory thresholds of 26 decibels or greater in at least three of the 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz frequencies; or

A speech recognition score of less than 94 percent upon a Maryland CNC Test.

Here, the first element of service connection, a current disability, is met. The Veteran was provided with a VA medical examination in June 2023. The puretone thresholds in the left ear at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz frequencies were 20, 15, 20, 25, and 40 decibels, respectively. See June 2023 DBQ. Additionally, in the June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ conceded the Veteran has left ear hearing loss for VA purposes. 

As conceded by the June 2024 rating decision, the second element of service connection is also met. Specifically, the Veteran's DD 214 shows that he had a MOS with a high probability of noise exposure.

The Board further finds the Veteran's current disability of left ear hearing loss is causally related to service.

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations in June 2023, August 2023, and September 2023. The VA examiner's concluded that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss is related to service. The examiners primarily rely on the fact that the Veteran had normal hearing at separation and concluded that his hearing loss is not related to the conceded acoustic trauma he experienced while in service. See June 2023 DBQ; August 2023 DBQ; September 2023 DBQ.

The Board is cognizant of the need to "stay in its lane," so to speak, and avoid invading the province of scientific or medical experts by exercising independent judgment on matters requiring specialized knowledge. See, e.g., Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991). 

The Board has considered the findings of the VA examiners, but the Board will not "outsource" its adjudicatory responsibility or authority to them. Sizemore v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 264 (2004). 

Here, the examiners note the Veteran's hearing loss is not related to service but did not provide an alternate explanation as to what could have caused his hearing loss. The Board notes that the Veteran experienced significant acoustic trauma while in service including a perforated ear drum. Moreover, the Veteran is already service connected for right ear hearing loss stemming from the same injury. 

Thus, given the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds all three elements are met, and service connection is warranted for left ear hearing loss. Accordingly, the Board grants service connection for left ear hearing loss.

This appeal is granted.

6.  Service connection for degenerative arthritis, right knee is granted.

The Veteran contends that his right knee degenerative arthritis is related to service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his right knee degenerative arthritis is secondary to his service-connected degenerative arthritis of the lower back and left knee. See Hearing Transcript.

The Board notes that in May 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim for his right knee condition which was denied in an August 2023 rating decision. The Veteran did not mention the denial of that particular condition in his VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, nor did he appeal it in the January 2025 VA Form 10182. 

However, the Veteran testified that in every examination concerning his left knee or lower back, he also mentioned his right knee.  Since VA is obligated to develop and adjudicate claims for secondary service connection that are reasonably raised during the processing of a properly initiated claim as to the primary service-connected disability's evaluation level, arguably, the claim was revived by the higher-level review of the relevant evidence. Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 201 (2021). 

Moreover, the Board notes the AOJ did render a final decision on that claim. The Board must read the documents filed by the Veteran in support of his appeal "liberally and sympathetically," as required by authorities such as Rivera v. Shinseki, 654 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Also, "[t]he VA disability compensation system is not meant to be a trap for the unwary, or a stratagem to deny compensation to a veteran who has a valid claim...." Comer v. Peake, 552 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (internal quotations omitted). Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran's January 2025 10182 appealed the denial of service connection for this disability. See also, Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021) (claims-processing rules "govern the orderly processing of cases but do not implicate jurisdiction"); Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428, 435 (2011) (rules are "jurisdictional" only if they govern "adjudicatory capacity"); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 455 (2004) ("jurisdiction" refers to the classes of cases or persons within the tribunal's adjudicatory domain). 

Service connection may be granted for a current disability resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) a current disability exists and (2) the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc).

Here, the RO conceded the Veteran has a current disability of right knee degenerative arthritis in the August 2023 rating decision. The Veteran is also service connected for degenerative arthritis of the lower back.

Therefore, the question now before the Board is whether the Veteran's right knee degenerative arthritis resulted from his service connected degenerative arthritis of the lower back disability or other service-connected disabilities.

Notably, the legal threshold for establishing secondary service connection is simple "but for" causation, which is a "broad standard" that allows for multiple causes of a harm. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1363-64 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

As such, the crux of the question before the Board is whether it is approximately as likely as not the Veteran would no longer have a right knee degenerative arthritis if his service-connected degenerative arthritis of the lower back disability were somehow eliminated from the analysis or if without the degenerative arthritis of the lower back disability or the degenerative arthritis of the left knee disability, the right knee degenerative arthritis would be less severe.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds the Veteran's right knee degenerative arthritis resulted from the changes to his gait caused by his service connected degenerative arthritis of the lower back and left knee.

The Board notes that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination to address the relationship between his right knee degenerative arthritis and his service-connected degenerative arthritis of the lower back disability. Generally, VA is required to provide an examination when the evidence of record indicates that a current disorder "may be associated" with a Veteran's military service. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i). This evidentiary requirement is a low threshold. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83. 

However, the Board will not burden the RO or the Veteran by remanding for a medical examination when the matter in question is already before the Board, and the evidence available to the Board is already sufficient to decide the issue and provide finality. See, e.g., Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding "[a] veteran's interest may be better served by prompt resolution of his claims rather than by further remands to cure procedural errors that, at the end of the day, may be irrelevant to final resolution....").

Here, the Board finds the evidence is already sufficient to establish service connection. Specifically, during the Veteran's back disability VA examination in June 2023, the examiner noted the Veteran uses a cane on the right side for ambulation. The examiner also noted the Veteran had a very stiff gait and was hunched over while walking. See June 2023 DBQ. 

Additionally, the Veteran described how the pain in his left leg caused him to place more weight on his right leg, eventually resulting in the pain in his right knee. See Hearing Transcript.

In conclusion, applying the benefit of the doubt doctrine, the Board finds the Veteran's right knee arthritis disability resulted from changes to his gait caused by his service-connected lower back and left knee arthritis disabilities. 

Accordingly, the Board finds service connection is warranted here, and this appeal is granted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
