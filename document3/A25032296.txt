ORDER

Service connection for migraine headaches is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran suffers from migraine headaches; however, the evidence is persuasively against a finding that her currently shown disability had its onset in or is otherwise related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an award of service connection for migraine headaches have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from May 1991 to August 1995, and from May 1999 to March 2001. Her decorations include the National Defense Service Medal. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. Following a further denial on Higher-Level Review in July 2024, the Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) later that month, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the January 2024 AOJ rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service connection for migraine headaches is denied.

The Veteran seeks to establish service connection for migraines headaches. She contends, in essence, that she has had migraines since briefly losing consciousness and falling and hitting her head during physical training in service. See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits).

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

If a Veteran serves 90 days or more of active, continuous service after December 31, 1946, and manifests certain chronic diseases-including organic diseases of the nervous system-to a degree of 10 percent or more during the one-year period following her separation from that service, service connection for the condition may be established on a presumptive basis, notwithstanding that there is no in-service record of the disorder. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Service connection may also be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) by (a) evidence of (i) a chronic disease shown as such in service (or within an applicable presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307) and (ii) subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease, or (b) if the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, by evidence of continuity of symptomatology. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) relating to continuity of symptomatology can be applied only in cases involving those conditions explicitly recognized as chronic under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A layperson is generally incapable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge. King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012). However, lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when: (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (e.g., a broken leg, separated shoulder, pes planus (flat feet), varicose veins, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), etc.), (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In essence, lay testimony is competent when it pertains to the readily observable features or symptoms of injury or illness and "may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection." Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). A determination as to whether medical evidence is needed to demonstrate that a Veteran presently has the same condition he or she had in service or during a presumptive period, or whether lay evidence will suffice, depends on the nature of the Veteran's present condition (e.g., whether the Veteran's present condition is of a type that requires medical expertise to identify it as the same condition as that in service or during a presumption period, or whether it can be so identified by lay observation). See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 310 (2007).

Thus, medical evidence is not always or categorically required when the determinative issue involves either medical diagnosis or etiology, but rather such issue may, depending on the facts of the particular case, be established by competent and credible lay evidence under 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). See Davidson, supra.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. An approximate balance of the evidence includes, but is not limited to, equipoise. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Evidence is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Id.

In the present case, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are entirely devoid of any evidence of a head injury. An October 1991 emergency care and treatment report shows that she was transported to a service department hospital by ambulance after passing out for a few seconds while doing physical training. The report states that she got dizzy after stationary exercise and was "eased to the ground by classmates" with "no bodily injury." The triage note indicates that she had not eaten breakfast that morning. On clinical evaluation at the hospital, she reported feeling "fine now," and no abnormalities were noted. The clinical assessment was that she had had a vasovagal reaction.

In September 1992, the Veteran was seen for complaints, including a dull headache in the sinus area, that were attributed to exudative oropharyngitis. In April 1995, she reported to sick call with complaints of nausea, light-headedness, and headaches. She indicated that she had increased her activities over the past two weeks, running two to three miles per day and exercising, and that she had not been drinking a lot of water. She related that she had been feeling somewhat nauseous and occasionally light-headed for the past three days, and that she had had a mild headache since the day prior to the clinical visit. The assessment was that she was suffering from dehydration, probably due to a viral syndrome. She was hydrated with two liters of fluid and noted afterwards that she was feeling much better.

Other than that, there are no service department records reflecting complaints of headaches. Indeed, the records show that the Veteran affirmatively denied having, or having ever had, a head injury or frequent or severe headaches in Reports of Medical History dated in October 1991, May 1992, March 1993, January 1994, June 1998, and April 1999.

After service, the first record of documented treatment for headaches is dated in April 2004. The Veteran had a walk-in appointment at a VA facility, reporting headaches that had lasted for four days. She indicated that she got headaches about three to four times per year and took medication for them. The physician's assessment was that the headaches seemed more like migraine headaches versus tension headaches.

In April 2008, the Veteran presented for treatment complaining of a variety of symptoms, including sore throat, cough, and headache. The clinical assessment was viral syndrome.

A private treatment record from February 2016 shows that the Veteran presented for treatment with a complaint of headaches for three days. It was noted that she had a well-established history of recurrent migraines. Thereafter, the medical records show more frequent medical care for migraines. The file also contains a headache diary that shows that she was suffering from migraines weekly, if not more often, from January 2023 to September 2023. There is no mention in the records of her headaches being attributable to service or to head trauma.

The Veteran also submitted lay statements in support of her claim. She provided her own statement, in part, as follows:

Throughout my years of service, I have experienced migraines . . . . My first recollection of migraines was during physical training while stationed in Pensacola Florida. During physical training one morning I passed out and hit my head. When I fell to the ground, I lost consciousness for a short period of time and when I regained consciousness I was in an ambulance. I was provided with pain medication, IV fluids, and put under observation. Currently I am on medication for migraines . . . 

See August 2023 VA Form 21-10210 (Lay/Witness Statement). 

One of the Veteran's coworkers provided a statement in August 2023 indicating that she had known the Veteran for over 15 years and witnessed her migraines becoming more and more frequent and painful over the years. See August 2023 VA Form 21-10210. A second coworker stated that she had worked in the same field office as the Veteran from 2003 to 2010 and from 2014 to 2020. That coworker also observed the Veteran suffering from migraines in the workplace, and expressed her belief that the Veteran's migraines were service connected. See August 2023 VA Form 21-10210.

In December 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with her claim. After examining the Veteran and reviewing the claims file, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's recurrent migraines were less likely than not caused by or incurred in service. The examiner noted that after reviewing the evidence, including the STRs, there was not enough evidence to substantiate that the Veteran's migraine headaches were related to service.

Following review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim. The record clearly shows that she has a current disability. However, the STRs are completely devoid of any evidence of a head injury during service. Although the evidence does show that she passed out for a few seconds during physical training in October 1991, as she has reported, the contemporaneous STRs show that she was eased to the ground by classmates and did not suffer any bodily injury, to include a head injury, as a result of that incident. Nor does the evidence support a finding of chronic or recurrent headaches, including migraines, during service or the one-year period following the Veteran's separation from either period of active duty. As outlined above, she was treated for headaches on only two occasions during service-which were medically attributed to exudative oropharyngitis and dehydration, rather than migraine-and she repeatedly denied having, or having ever had, a head injury or frequent or severe headaches on multiple occasions from 1991 to 1999.

The post-service evidence also weighs persuasively against a finding of a link, or nexus, between the Veteran's current disability and service. As noted, after an examination of the Veteran and review of the evidence, a VA examiner in December 2023 concluded that it was unlikely that the Veteran's migraines were related to service. Inasmuch as the examiner's opinion was based on an accurate understanding of the facts, and articulates reasons for the conclusion reached, the Board finds the opinion probative. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008); see also Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 105 (2012) (there is no requirement that a medical examiner comment on every favorable piece of evidence in a claims file); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 293 (2012) (noting that the law imposes no reasons-or-bases requirement on examiners).

The lay statements from the Veteran's coworkers do not reflect that they knew or observed the Veteran during her periods of service or during the one-year period following separation from her second period of active duty.  Moreover, there is nothing in the record to establish that either the Veteran or her coworkers have the specialized training or experience necessary to render competent opinions with respect to medically complex matters relating to the etiology of migraines. In addition, to the extent the Veteran's current statements can be interpreted as alleging in-service onset of symptoms with continuity since, the Board must find that her statements lack credibility inasmuch as they are inconsistent with what she reported during service, when she repeatedly denied having frequent headaches. That is not to say that she is willfully manufacturing facts; only that her current recollection of events is at odds with what she reported previously. The lay statements as they pertain to nexus are clearly outweighed by other evidence, to include the December 2023 VA medical nexus opinion.

In sum, the Board finds that migraine headaches were not shown as chronic in service and were not shown to have become manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period. Continuity of symptomatology since service is not established, and the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against a finding that the current disability began in service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease, to include an in-service head injury.

As the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.103. The appeal is denied.
