ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his tinnitus began during active service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from February 1986 to February 1989.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In June 2024, the Veteran electronically submitted three VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeals (Notice of Disagreement) within a few minutes of each other.  On the first version submitted, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  On the second, he elected the Hearing docket.  On the third, he again elected the Direct Review docket.  Because the most recently submitted Notice of Disagreement elected the Direct Review docket, the Board has docketed this appeal in the Direct Review docket.  Furthermore, because the Board is granting in full the sole benefit sought in this appeal, there can be no harm to the Veteran in not receiving a Board hearing.      

In the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection for Tinnitus

The Veteran is seeking service connection for tinnitus.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

On his April 2024 VA 21-526 EZ claim form, the Veteran indicated that his tinnitus began during service.  

In May 2024, VA provided an examination to assess the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed tinnitus.  The Veteran reported that although he could not recall the specific incident that triggered his tinnitus, it had become more consistent over time and now occurs daily, sometimes lasting most of the day.  The examiner acknowledged the Veteran's in-service exposure to hazardous noise from gunfire and hand grenade explosions but opined that the lack of significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds greater than normal measurement variability from entrance to separation made it less likely than not that the Veteran's tinnitus is related to in-service noise exposure.  

The absence of tinnitus in service does not preclude service connection if the evidence shows a disability was nevertheless incurred in or aggravated by in-service hazardous noise exposure. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 163-64 (1993) (addressing a claim for service connection for hearing loss which did not manifest during service).  All competent evidence of record must be considered, including lay statements regarding symptoms, dates of symptom onset, and treatment.  Id.; See also Layno v Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

Tinnitus is a condition capable of lay observation and diagnosis. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (observing that "ringing in the ears is capable of lay observation.").

The Board finds that the May 2024 VA examiner's opinion improperly failed to address the competent lay evidence of the Veteran's statements regarding in-service onset of his symptoms.  The Board therefor assigns little probative weight to the examiner's opinion.

As the record shows that the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise during service and the Veteran has competently and credibly reported the in-service onset of his current tinnitus, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise regarding whether the Veteran's tinnitus began during active service.  Service 

?

connection for tinnitus is therefore warranted and the Veteran's appeal is granted.
