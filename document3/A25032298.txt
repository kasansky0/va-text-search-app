DOCKET NO. 240828-471509
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his prostate cancer is at least as likely as not related to his in-service exposure to foam fire retardant.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for prostate cancer are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1970 to January 1973.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The March 2024 rating decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ and the Board will proceed to the address the claim on the merits.  See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service Connection

The Veteran contends that his prostate cancer is related to his in-service exposure to hazardous materials, including foam fire retardant.  See September 2022 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim.

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability, diagnosed as prostate cancer, that is related to his in-service exposure to hazardous materials, including foam fire retardant. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

As noted by the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of prostate cancer.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.

A January 2023 VA Memorandum concluded that the Veteran had participated in a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) as a result of his in-service exposure to foam fire retardant and nuclear missiles.  The memorandum noted that such exposure was based on the Veteran's September 2022 statement; however, the memorandum also noted that such exposure was consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's service as an aircraft maintenance specialist.

In a February 2023 VA medical opinion, an examiner concluded that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's prostate cancer was related to his in-service TERA, after considering the potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities.  In support of this conclusion, the examiner quoted a study which found that some environmental exposures that have increased the risk of prostate cancer in men who are exposure to certain chemicals include firefighters that are regularly exposed to combustion by-products.  The examiner then noted that the Veteran was an aircraft maintenance specialist for seven years and was exposure to foam fire retardant.

Although there are other VA medical opinions of record, none of the opinions address whether the Veteran's prostate cancer is related to his exposure to foam fire retardant.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current prostate cancer is related to his military service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for prostate cancer is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
