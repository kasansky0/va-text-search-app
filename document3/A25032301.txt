DOCKET NO. 240321-427140
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD) (claimed as "heartburn") is denied.

Service connection for left knee strain is denied.

REMANDED

A rating higher than 10 percent for narcolepsy type 1 with cataplexy is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that GERD began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

2.  The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that left knee strain began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for service connection for GERD are not met. 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505; 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(22), 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.6, 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for Service connection for left knee strain are not met. 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505; 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(22), 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.6, 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty from August 2015 to March 2016, January 2020 to February 2020, and August 2020 to September 2020, and March 2022 with interim service in the National Guard.

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issues of service connection for heartburn and left knee pain previously addressed in a May 2021 rating decision and the evaluation of narcolepsy previously addressed in an April 2023 rating decision. In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a Supplemental Claim rating decision on appeal, which continued denial of the claims.

In March 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, wherein the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Service Connection

Compensation may be awarded for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110.  Service connection basically means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that an injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in- service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d).

Reserve and National Guard service generally means active duty for training (ACDUTRA) and inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA).  ACDUTRA is full time duty for training purposes performed by Reservists and National Guardsmen pursuant to 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505.  38 U.S.C. § 101 (22); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(c).  That usually includes two weeks of annual training and/or an initial period of training.  INACDUTRA includes duty, other than full-time duty, performed for training purposes by Reservists and National Guardsmen pursuant to 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505.  38 U.S.C. § 101 (23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(d). 

With respect to National Guard service, service connection may only be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated while performing ACDUTRA, or an injury incurred or aggravated while performing INACDUTRA.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (24), 106, 1110, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6, 3.303, 3.304.  Service connection is generally not legally merited when a disability incurred on INACDUTRA results from a disease process.  See Brooks v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 484, 487 (1993).

The evidentiary presumptions-such as the presumption of sound condition at entrance to service, the presumption of aggravation during service of preexisting diseases or injuries which undergo an increase in severity during service, and the presumption of service incurrence for certain diseases that manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a specified time after separation from service-do not extend to those who claim service connection based on a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA.  Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 470-71 (1995); McManaway v. West, 13 Vet. App. 60, 67 (citing Paulson, 7 Vet. App. at 469-70, for the proposition that, "if a claim relates to period of [ACDUTRA], a disability must have manifested itself during that period; otherwise, the period does not qualify as active military service and claimant does not achieve veteran status for purposes of that claim.").

1.  Service connection for heartburn

2.  Service connection for left knee pain

The Veteran contends that heartburn and left knee pain began during basic training (his initial period of active duty) and has continued since.  See VA 21-4138 (September 2023). The Veteran reports having a "great deal of pain in [his]left knee due to the constant running for physical training, and the constant movement under load during training exercises." He believes that consistently eating meals ready-to-eat (MREs) during basic training caused "regular gagging, vomiting, and consistent heartburn."

The Board finds that, while the Veteran has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD) and left knee strain, the weight of the evidence is against finding that the claimed conditions began during active duty or were incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during a period of ACDUTRA.

Active duty and National Guard treatment records reflect no complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for gastrointestinal or left knee disability. There are no line of duty determinations regarding an injury in service related to the claimed conditions. At an August 2020 sleep medicine appointment, the Veteran denied having gastrointestinal symptoms, dysphagia, heartburn, musculoskeletal symptoms, muscle aches, arthralgias, or pain in the lower extremities. See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility at 56 (March 2021). 

Heartburn and left knee pain were first noted in the record on the Veteran's March 2021 application for VA compensation. At an August 2023 VA behavioral health consult, the Veteran endorsed "back and knee pain" during the screening. See CAPRI at 76 (September 2023). No further complaints of knee pain and no specific complaints regarding the left knee are noted in the Veteran's VA treatment records. VA treatment records reflect no complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for symptoms of GERD.

A May 2021 VA examination diagnosed GERD and documents the Veteran's reports that symptoms begin in 2015 and have continued with no increase or decrease in severity to date.  See C&P Exam (May 2021). No VA medical opinion on the etiology of GERD is associated with the record.

At a May 2021 VA examination for the knee and lower leg, the Veteran reported onset of left knee pain during physical training in 2018 which has worsened over time. The concurrent VA medical opinion did not relate left knee strain to service reasoning that "pain may have existed during service based on subjective report, but records support veteran was not first treated for the claim until after discharge."

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that neither GERD nor left knee pain began during a period of active-duty service. There is no competent evidence (lay or medical) of either disability during noted periods of active duty or within an applicable presumptive period.

Additionally, to establish status as a "veteran" based upon a period of ACDUTRA, a claimant must establish that he was disabled from disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during that period of ACDUTRA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(a), (d); Harris v. West, 13 Vet. App. 509, 511 (2000); Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 470 (1995). The fact that a claimant establishes status as a "veteran" for purposes of other periods of service (e.g., AD) does not obviate the need to establish that he/she is also a "veteran" for purposes of the period of ACDUTRA where the claim for benefits is premised on that period of ACDUTRA. Mercado-Martinez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 415, 419 (1998).

The Veteran has not established that GERD or left knee strain were incurred during a period of ACDUTRA.  Though he argues that the conditions began during his initial period of ACDUTRA (an established period of active duty) and he was "dissuaded" from going to sick call because attending medical appointments could cause him to be recycled, the Board finds his statements are not credible. See VA 21-4138 (September 2023), VA Form 10182 (March 2024). National Guard service is intermittent by design and, generally, requires one weekend per month and two weeks of training annually (roughly 36 days per year) after the initial period of ACDUTRA though longer periods may be required.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative has explained nor is the Board able to conclude why the Veteran would not have mentioned or sought treatment for chronic heartburn or left knee pain in the six years between claimed onset during his initial period of active duty and the first mention of either condition in the record - particularly since the Veteran was only constrained by the threat or "recycling" during his initial period of active duty. Additionally, with the exception of his compensation claim and the May 2021 VA examination, the Veteran has not reported any symptoms of GERD and, in fact, specifically denied having any in August 2020. Finally, reports for purposes of compensation that left knee pain had onset during his initial period of ACDUTRA conflict with reports to medical professionals that left knee pain began in 2018, which is not an established period of active duty.

As the Veteran's statements to VA medical examiners are incongruous with his contemporaneous medical records and reports, the Board finds the medical evidence reflecting no signs or symptoms of GERD or left knee disability in service and his later statements made in furtherance of treatment more probative than his uncorroborated statements made in pursuit of compensation. Therefore, in view of the above taken together, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements have little probative value.

On balance, the weight of the evidence is against the claim. 

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

REASONS FOR REMAND

In remanding these matters, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions.  Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.  Indeed, the Board expressly defers a credibility determination in this appeal until the development has been completed to the extent feasible.

A rating higher than 10 percent for narcolepsy 

The Veteran seeks an increased rating for narcolepsy. Medical treatment records associated with the record reflect no treatment for narcolepsy since September 2020.  (Note: The evidence reflects that conditions caused or aggravated by the Veteran's narcolepsy which are not on appeal have been recently treated.) 

After review of the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal, the Board finds that remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

First, remand is required to attempt to obtain private medical records reasonably identified by the record. A September 2023 sleep medicine note indicated the Veteran would be "refer(red) to community care to assess for using Xyrem for the treatment of narcolepsy."  See CAPRI at 3 (September 2023).  VA treatment records associated with the claims file at the time of the period on appeal cover the period ending December 8, 2023, and reflect no treatment for narcolepsy.  During the appeal period, the Board is unable to determine whether community care was ordered for the claimed condition.

Additionally, the Board finds that the October 2023 VA examination is inadequate as it relies entirely on information reported by the Veteran.  The examination reflects the Veteran experiences cataplectic episodes more than 10 times per week. See C&P Exam (October 2023). The Veteran reported daily sleep attacks with strong urge to sleep followed by short nap for 15 minutes preceded by cataplexy. He indicated the episodes "may occur up to 4-5 times a day." The Veteran had not ever had major or minor seizures. Although an opinion need not discuss all potentially favorable or unfavorable evidence to render an adequate opinion, Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 105 (2012), it must be clear that the provider of the opinion was "informed of sufficient facts upon which to base an opinion relevant to the problem at hand." Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 303 (2008). Here there is an absence of meaningful discussion of medical evidence or principles associated with the Veteran's claim for the period of appeal because such evidence did not exist in the record before the examiner or currently before the Board.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for private treatment records from any treatment for narcolepsy.  Make two requests for the authorized records unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

2.  Then, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for his narcolepsy. The examiner must review the claims file. The examiner is asked to determine the current severity of service-connected narcolepsy. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.
