FINDINGS OF FACT

The Veteran did not file a timely appeal to a January 2019 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for compliance with the appropriate claims processing rules for appealing the January 2019 AOJ decision to the Board have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 7108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 20.202-20.204 (in effect prior to February 19, 2019.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1990 to February 1993.

The Veteran has filed an appeal with respect to a January 2019 AOJ rating decision which address the issues listed on the title page. By letter dated January 14, 2019, the Veteran was advised of this rating decision and his appellate rights. More specifically, he was advised of "Legacy" appeal rights by filing a notice of disagreement within one year of the date of notice of the denial. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202-204 (in effect prior to February 19, 2019).

The Veteran filed his appeal to the Board in April 2024. Regardless of whether the correct form was used, the Veteran's appeal was well beyond the one year time year for timely filing an appeal. Notably, the January 14, 2019, notice was mailed to the last known address of record and was not returned as untimely. The AOJ used the same address identified on the recent VA Form 10182 received in April 2024. The notice was also sent to his representative. The Board finds proper notice of the January 2019 AOJ decision. The Board shall not entertain an application for review on appeal unless it conforms to the law, see 38 U.S.C. § 7108, and this attempted appeal is untimely.

Notably, the Veteran has requested a filing extension citing "memory loss and concentration issues over the past few years." See April 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran does not describe that these symptoms resulted in incapacitation or precluded him from timely filing an appeal. A December 2018 VA mental disorders examination reflected that the Veteran was working as an instructor, was active in church, and served as a deacon at his church. There is no description such as illness, hospitalization of the claimant or death of an immediate family member which would have prevented a timely filing. The Board finds that good cause is not shown. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).

The Board will also consider the concept of "equitable tolling," which applies where circumstances preclude a timely filing, despite the exercise of due diligence, such as: (1) a mental illness rendering one incapable of handling one's own affairs or other "extraordinary circumstances" beyond one's control, (2) reliance on the incorrect statement of a VA official, or (3) a misfiling at the AOJ or the Board.  See Bove v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2011) (per curiam order).  There is a three-part test to determine whether "extraordinary circumstances" justify equitable tolling: (1) the extraordinary circumstance must be beyond the veteran's control, (2) that it caused an inability to file during the requested tolling period, and (3) that the veteran exercised due diligence in preserving his or her appellate rights, meaning that a reasonably diligent person, under the same circumstances, would not have filed his or her appeal within the appeal period.  Checo v. Shinseki, 748 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  If "extraordinary circumstances" are shown, the "clock stops" and the requested period is not counted against the time-period for filing.  Id.  

As discussed above, the Veteran has claimed memory loss and concentration issues, but he has functioned well in a workplace and church environment. He is not shown to be incapable of handling his affairs, and extraordinary circumstances beyond the Veteran's control are not shown. There is no showing of due diligence in prosecuting the appeal. Additionally, the January 14, 2019, notice of decision letter properly advised the Veteran of his Legacy rights, including providing him a VA Form 21-0958. This notice was also sent to the Veteran's correct address, and also to his representative. While the Veteran filed the wrong form for a Legacy appeal, the form used by the Veteran is not relevant - the timeliness of any filing until several years later is a determining factor in this particular appeal. The Board finds no basis for equitable tolling. See Roseberry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 17, 21 (2023) ("To establish equitable tolling, the appellant must demonstrate (1) an extraordinary circumstance, (2) due diligence in attempting to file, and (3) a connection between the extraordinary circumstance and the failure to timely file.")

The Board notes that, in Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims referenced an NOD under the legacy system as a "nonjurisdictional claims processing rule" and specifically stated that "[t]o the extent that any of our prior cases have held that the deadline for filing an NOD is jurisdictional, they are overruled." This appeal is not being dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, but rather for failure to comply with the claims processing rules. Therefore, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) do not apply.

The Board further observes that, on August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (to be codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  Under the AMA, an AMA appeal may come to the Board in three ways:

(1) through a RAMP rating decision;

(2) appeal of a rating decision with a notification letter dated on or after February 19, 2019; or

(3) appeal of a Statement of the Case or Supplemental Statement of the Case issued on or after February 19, 2019.

A Legacy claim is a claim for which VA provided notice of an initial decision prior to February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2.

Here, the claims processing rules come under the Legacy provisions. The April 2024 filing is an AMA NOD which would not necessarily be an impediment to properly filing a Legacy appeal if the timeliness aspect had been met. Here, however, the Veteran's attempted appeal is several years late.

The Veteran's appeal has been docketed at the Board. However, as with any appellate system, the Board's mere administrative docketing of a claim does not demonstrate acceptance or waiver of a claims processing rule. See Martin v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d. 1338, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (describing the docketing of an appeal by the Board as a ministerial task).  

For the foregoing reasons, the claims for entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, headaches, left hip degenerative arthritis, loss of memory, post-traumatic stress disorder or any mental disorder, right hip pain, shortness of breath, sinusitis, and skin rash, must be dismissed.

The Veteran may file a supplemental claim under the AMA for reconsideration of his claims.
