ORDER

Entitlement to a temporary evaluation of 100 percent for nodular basal cell carcinoma s/p MOHS procedure is granted.

REMAND

Entitlement to a total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU), to include extraschedular, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma and received chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an evaluation of 100 percent for nodular basal cell carcinoma s/p MOHS procedure have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.20, 4.21, 4.118, DC 7833.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1970 to March 1978.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which confirmed and continued the 30 percent rating for basal cell carcinoma s/p MOHs procedure.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ/RO) decision, which was subsequently subject to the October 2023 higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ/RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

VA regulations require that the Board contact an appellant and request clarification if the Board cannot identify which review option an appellant intends to select. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f). A Notice of Disagreement (NOD) may be unclear if an appellant attaches evidence to a NOD indicating that the appellant is seeking Direct Review, as evidence submitted along with an NOD may not be considered by the Board under that review option. See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023).

In the instant appeal, the Veteran's attorney submitted statement along with the August 2024 VA Form 10182, to include argument and request for action. These arguments provided no new theory of entitlement or evidence. The present appeal is therefore factually distinguishable from Edwards, and the Board can proceed with a decision without clarifying the Veteran's intent pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f).

By way of procedural background, service connection for nodular basal cell carcinoma s/p MOHS procedure was granted in a rating decision issued in September 2022. The rating decision assigned a 30 percent rating. 

In September 2023, the Veteran sought a higher level review seeking a review "to ensure proper evaluation is awarded." A rating decision was issued in October 2023 which confirmed and continued the 30 percent rating evaluation. 

The Veteran timely submitted a notice of disagreement (10182/NOD) in August 2024, seeking review of the claim. As such, the claim for a rating of 100 percent for nodular basal cell carcinoma s/p MOHS procedure is properly before the Board for adjudication.

The Board notes that the Veteran sought entitlement to disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) as part of his September 2023 claim for a higher level review. The Board also notes that the October 2023 rating decision did not address the TDIU claim as it was not part of the prior decision from which the higher level review was raised. As such, the "IU was not raised by the prior closed record."

The Board notes that in Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) stated that a claim for a TDIU due to service-connected disability is part and parcel of an increased rating claim when such claim is raised by the record. The record suggests the Veteran is not working.  In light of the Court's holding in Rice, the Board considers the TDIU claim as part of the pending increased rating claim and has accordingly listed the raised TDIU claim as an issue on appeal.

Increased Disability Ratings Laws and Regulations

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history, and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Examination reports are to be interpreted in light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of a veteran working or seeking work. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. Reasonable doubt will be resolved in the claimant's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating is assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, the Board must also consider staged ratings. Staged ratings are appropriate when the evidence establishes that the claimed disability manifested symptoms that would warrant different ratings for distinct time periods during the appeal. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509- 10 (2007).

Pyramiding, that is the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when evaluating a veteran's service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 (2020). However, it is possible for a veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury which would permit rating under several diagnostic codes; the critical element in permitting the assignment of several evaluations under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection of parts of the musculoskeletal system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance. The functional loss may be due to absence of part, or all, of the necessary bones, joints, and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective innervation, or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion. Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206-07 (1995).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must also analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990). Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) ("although interest may affect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect competency to testify").

Entitlement to an evaluation of 100 percent for six months for nodular basal cell carcinoma s/p MOHS procedure.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to 100 percent rating for his skin cancer from the date of this treatment for 6 months pursuant to 38 CFR 4.118 DC 7818. See August 2024 NOD.

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran has been in receipt of a 30 percent rating for nodular basal cell carcinoma s/p MOHS procedure pursuant to 38 CFR 4.118 DC 7833-7800.

DC 7833 provides that malignant melanoma are rated as scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800), or impairment of function (under the appropriate body system). A Note provides that, If a skin malignancy requires therapy that is comparable to that used for systemic malignancies, i.e., systemic chemotherapy, X-ray therapy more extensive than to the skin, or surgery more extensive than wide local excision, a 100-percent evaluation will be assigned from the date of onset of treatment, and will continue, with a mandatory VA examination six months following the completion of such antineoplastic treatment, and any change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination will be subject to the provisions of § 3.105(e). If there has been no local recurrence or metastasis, evaluation will then be made on residuals. If treatment is confined to the skin, the provisions for a 100-percent evaluation do not apply. DC 7818, which addresses malignant skin neoplasms (other than malignant melanoma), provides that such be evaluated under the same criteria articulated under DC 7833, to include the Note. 

In the instant case, the Veteran's skin cancer has been rated under DC 7833 based on residuals under DC 7800. Specifically, in the assignment of a diagnostic code, with diseases, preference is to be given to the number itself; if the rating is determined based on residual conditions, the number appropriate to the residual condition will be added, preceded by a hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Therefore, the Veteran's malignant melanoma (DC 7833) has been rated based on residual scarring (DC 7800). In light of the following, the Board has considered the Veteran's claim based on DC 7833 for malignant melanoma.

A review of the Veteran's post-service treatment shows that following a May 2019 biopsy of the Veteran's right ear, the Veteran was diagnosed with nodular basal cell carcinoma in the right inferior posterior helix. See Cockerell Dermatopathology. The Veteran underwent MOHs surgery on June 12, 2019. See private provider K.H., MD. 

In June 2019, the Veteran sought care from the Central Texas VAMC who sought prior approval for Vismodegib for the Veteran's basal cell carcinoma of skin. In November 2019, the Veteran sought primary VA follow up care that included basal cell carcinoma. The Veteran was referred to oncology for radiation as the MOHs surgery did not show clear deep margins. During a May 2020 treatment, the Veteran reported that he finished radiation therapy for his ear lesion on March 4th and was doing well. During a July 2020 dermatology consult, the Veteran was noted to have "completed radiation for basal cell neoplasm right ear." The Veteran reported having a history of basal cell carcinoma to his right ear; he initially had Mohs, but given its size, the Veteran was started on Vismodegib for 4 months and then had radiation therapy. The Veteran completed radiation therapy in March of 2020. See Central Texas VAMC.

The Veteran was afforded a September 2022 VA skin examination. The VA examiner noted a diagnosis of nodular basal cell carcinoma s/p MOHS procedure. The Veteran reported onset in 2019 with a mass behind the right ear. It was found to be basal cell carcinoma. The Veteran's treatment included: "MOHS procedure in 2019; Chemo 3 months and 30 days of radiation; (Erivedge, VISMODEGIB); Completed treatment in March 2020; Now: Check up every 6 months with dermatology." The VA examiner noted the location as the Veteran's right inferior posterior helix and right ear. The examiner also noted the Veteran had no other treatment or therapies in the prior six months.

According to the Mayo Clinic, Vismodegib (oral) is "used to treat metastatic basal cell carcinoma, a certain type of skin cancer that has already spread through the body. It also treats advanced basal cell carcinoma that has come back after surgery or cannot be treated with radiation or surgery." https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/vismodegib-oral-route/description/drg-20075421. (Last seen April 7, 2025). 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran required a therapy that was comparable to systemic chemotherapy. As such, "a 100-percent evaluation will be assigned from the date of onset of treatment, and will continue, with a mandatory VA examination six months following the completion of such antineoplastic treatment." 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 DC 7833 note. 

The Board notes that service connection for the Veteran's basal cell carcinoma was granted from June 13, 2019, the date of the Veteran's intent to file. As the Veteran was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma in May 2019, the Veteran is entitled to a 100 percent evaluation for the remaining five months. 

The Board notes that the Veteran was afforded September 2022 VA skin and scar examinations. Because such examinations were completed following the expiration of the 100 percent rating period, a rating in excess of assigned 30 percent, but no higher, for scars is warranted. The Board finds the September 2022 examinations were adequate and no further examination is required. 

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran required therapy that is comparable to that which is used for systemic malignancies, including systemic chemotherapy. Resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to a 100 percent rating following the conclusion of his treatment. Thus, entitlement to a higher rating for basal cell carcinoma is granted. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

As stated above, the Board notes that in Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) stated that a claim for a TDIU due to service-connected disability is part and parcel of an increased rating claim when such claim is raised by the record.

At a post-service VA audio treatment in April 2010, the Veteran reported he was unemployed in April 2010. At a May 2010 Compensation and Pension examination, the Veteran reported he was unemployed as of April 14, 2009 and retired from a full time position. See Central Texas VAMC.

At a December 2011 VA PTSD examination, the Veteran reported he "used to be an usher at the theater and then an acting assistant manager; I worked in the body shop at a car dealer." The Veteran further reported that he "worked for the VA in Waco doing groundskeeping; I worked with my brother-in-law in the oil fields; then I worked for Pine Forest Golf Club in maintenance; then I worked for an alcohol and drug treatment center for four or five years doing maintenance and security until they shut down; then I worked for HEB in maintenance and then as a night stocker; I retired from HEB in 2009; I worked 15 years for them." The examiner noted there "appeared to be no history of significant occupationally-related difficulties stemming from mental disorder symptoms."

During a June 2012 homeless call, the Veteran reported he "lost everything in a fire months ago. Caller states he is still living in his property in a shed he built. Caller is wondering if I can expedite his claim with the VAMC. Let caller know I could not do that however since he is living in a shed I would put in a consult to talk with the homeless team about his situation. Caller is not working and collects disability payments of 963.00 a month. Will submit a consult for the veteran." See Central Texas VAMC.

At the Veteran's April 2017 VA PTSD examination, the Veteran reported that after discharge, he worked in grounds keeping and housekeeping for the VA hospital in Waco, TX. He then worked as a crane operator in the oil fields, on a golf course for 8 years and as a security guard. His last job was with HEB for 15 years until he retired in 2009. Veteran denied any further occupational or educational history. He indicated problems with memory and concentration.

In light of the Court's holding in Rice, the Board has considered the TDIU claim as part of his pending increased rating claim and has accordingly listed the raised TDIU claim as an issue.

The Board notes that the Veteran raised the claim of TDIU on his October 2023 claim for a higher level review. However, the claim was not addressed as it was not a part of the rating decision from which the higher level review was claimed. As such, TDIU has not been addressed on its merits. 

On remand, the AOJ/RO should send the Veteran proper notice, afford him the opportunity to file a formal claim for TDIU and then adjudicate this matter in the first instance, to include an extraschedular basis if warranted.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand to the AOJ/RO to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors (including when the AOJ/RO failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records, failed to obtain a VA examination, or provided an inadequate VA examination or opinion). Additionally, the Board must remand for any pre-decisional error on the part of the AOJ/RO to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A and may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ/RO in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

For the above reasons, a remand is warranted for a new opinion to cure a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Send the Veteran the proper notice that advises him about what is needed to substantiate a claim for a TDIU. In addition, ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.

2. Then, if applicable, refer the Veteran's claim to the Director of Compensation and Pension Service, for consideration of an extraschedular TDIU award in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b). The Director should note that an extraschedular evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b) requires a determination that a Veteran is rendered unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of his service-connected disabilities.

3. After ensuring full compliance with this remand, readjudicate the claim on appeal.
