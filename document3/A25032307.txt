FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The May 2024 NOD / VA Form 10182 for the current appeal to the Board was received more than one year after earlier, final legacy rating decisions dated in December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017.  These rating decisions previously denied the issues of service connection for bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy, RIGHT knee arthritis, LEFT knee joint pain, RIGHT elbow joint pain, LEFT elbow joint pain, plantar fasciitis of the feet, hypertension, GERD, migraine headaches, PTSD with insomnia, unspecified personality disorder, sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, and entitlement to a TDIU.  In addition, no good cause has been established that would permit an extension of time (beyond the one-year limit) for the filing of an informal or formal NOD in the legacy system.  Finally, no basis for waiver or forfeiture of the relevant "claims-processing rule" has been shown. 

2. With regard to presumptive service connection for nasal symptomatology as an undiagnosed illness or MUCMI under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, the Veteran did not serve in the "Southwest Asia Theater of Operations" or in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, or Jordan during the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s or thereafter.

3. With regard to presumptive service connection for allergic rhinitis or sinusitis based on exposure to fine, particulate matter under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320, the Veteran did not serve in the "Southwest Asia theater of operations" during the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s, or in Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti, or Uzbekistan on or after September 19, 2001, during the Persian Gulf War.  

4. The Veteran has not identified a medically unexplained multi-symptom illness (MUCMI) disability that manifests in specific signs and symptoms or causes functional impairment in earning capacity.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria have been met for dismissal of the appeal for the issues of whether new and relevant evidence (NRE) have been received to readjudicate the previously denied claims of service connection for bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy, RIGHT knee arthritis, LEFT knee joint pain, RIGHT elbow joint pain, LEFT elbow joint pain, plantar fasciitis of the feet, hypertension, GERD, migraine headaches, PTSD with insomnia, unspecified personality disorder, sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and fibromyalgia.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1) (2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.109, 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.201, 20.302(a) (in effect from 2014 to 2017).  

2. The criteria have been met for dismissal of the appeal for the issue of whether new and relevant evidence (NRE) has been received to readjudicate the previously denied claim of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1) (2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.109, 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.201, 20.302(a) (in effect from 2014 to 2017).  

3. The criteria have not been met for presumptive service connection only for allergic rhinitis or sinusitis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 as a qualifying chronic disability, OR under 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 as due to exposure to fine, particular matter.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101(33), 1110, 1154, 1117, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(i), 3.102, 3.303, 3.317, 3.320.   

4. The criteria have not been met for service connection for a medically unexplained multi-symptom illness (MUCMI), to include as a qualifying chronic disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.102, 3.151, 3.155, 3.160, 3.303, 3.317; Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1992 to December 1993 in the U.S. Air Force.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 4, 2024, Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In response to the March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision on appeal, the Veteran filed a May 3, 2024, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement / NOD) (VA Form 10182).  In his May 3, 2024, NOD, the Veteran selected the Direct Review Lane, or direct review of the same evidence considered by the AOJ.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301.  Therefore, the present Board decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision, but no later.  Id.

Subsequent to the March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision on appeal, the Veteran submitted additional lay evidence (a March 2025 lay / witness statement (VA Form 21-10210) and a March 8, 2025, Application for Compensation), during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  In that respect, the Board cannot consider this additional lay evidence, as it was not in the claims file at the time of the AOJ's March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103(c)(2); 20.300, 20.301, 20.801(a) (2024).  Moreover, the Board has not waived the evidentiary submission window in this case.  Bolds v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 359 (2024).  

In addition, subsequent to the March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision, the AOJ also secured additional VA-generated evidence (VA treatment records and VA examinations and VA medical opinions).  These particular VA treatment records and VA examinations and VA medical opinions were all generated and dated after the March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision.  Several of these additional VA treatment records and VA examinations and VA medical opinions may contain evidence considered to be relevant to the service connection issues on appeal.  However, under the AMA, constructive possession of VA medical evidence has only limited application.  Thus, the Board will not consider any of the additional VA-generated evidence secured by the AOJ after the March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision.  That is, the Board cannot consider this additional VA medical evidence, as this VA medical evidence was not generated at the time of the AOJ's March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision.  Also, there is no confirmation that any earlier "relevant" and "reasonably connected" VA medical evidence within the actual custody of the VHA was constructively received by the VBA at the time when the VBA had knowledge of the existence of said VA medical records through information furnished by the Veteran sufficient to locate those VA medical records.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103(A)(c), 7113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103(c)(2)(iii), 20.300, 20.301, 20.801(a); Davis v. McDonough, 36. Vet. App. 142 (2023).  

Regardless, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted or generated that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on these claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

However, for the other service connection claims below for sinusitis / allergic rhinitis and sleep apnea that the Board is remanding to the AOJ for further development, any evidence the Board could not consider in the present Board decision will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

With regard to a preliminary matter, in the present Board decision, for purposes of clarity, the Board will separately address the theories of etiology for the Veteran's sinusitis / allergic rhinitis claim on appeal (presumptive service connection based on the provisions of §§ 3.317 and 3.320 vs. direct service connection).  See Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (the Board need only address theories of recovery reasonably raised within the evidence of record).  In doing so, the Board concludes that splitting up the previous single service connection issue for the sinusitis / allergic rhinitis claim into two separate issues for independent adjudication is the most proper way of handling the Veteran's appeal.  See Locklear v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 311 (2011) (bifurcation of a claim generally is within VA's discretion); Tyrues v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 166, 178-79 (2009), aff'd, 631 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (VA is free to dismember a claim and adjudicate it in separate pieces).  

On this point, when determining service connection, all theories of entitlement must be considered if raised by the evidence of record, applying all relevant laws and regulations.  Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The Federal Circuit has confirmed that the procedural history and statements by the claimant are relevant in determining the claimant's reasonable expectations and understanding, as service connection issues may be properly bifurcated and adjudicated separately if necessary.  Murphy v. Wilkie, 983 F.3d. 1313, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  "[A]lthough there may be multiple theories or means of establishing entitlement to a benefit for a disability, if the theories all pertain to the same benefit for the same disability, they constitute the same claim."  Roebuck v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 307, 313 (2006).  In the instant case, the issue of service connection for sinusitis / allergic rhinitis on a presumptive basis, as a qualifying chronic disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, or as due to exposure to fine particulate matter under the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320, is ripe for adjudication.  In contrast, the separate issue of service connection for sinusitis / allergic rhinitis on a direct basis only requires further development at the AOJ level, and thus will be remanded.  

With regard to a final preliminary matter, the Veteran is represented by Sean A. Kendall, Attorney.  See e.g., December 2024 Power of Attorney (on a VA Form 21-22a).  However, in January 2025 correspondence, the Veteran's attorney submitted a "Motion to Withdraw as Attorney," in which he attempted to withdraw his representation of the Veteran in the present matter because "I am unable to continue as the Veteran's representative."  This motion to withdraw representation from the Veteran's attorney was filed eight months after the submission of the Veteran's appeal to the Board in the May 2024 NOD / VA Form 10182.  

Under VA regulation, in an AMA appeal, when a request to withdraw is received after an appeal to the Board has been filed, the representative is obligated to present a motion to the Board in writing demonstrating "good cause" to withdraw services as the Veteran's representative.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.6(a)(2) (effective February 19, 2019) (formerly 38 C.F.R. § 20.608 (2018)).  Good cause for such purposes is the extended illness or incapacitation of the representative; failure of the appellant to cooperate with proper preparation and presentation of the appeal; or other factors which make the continuation of representation impossible, impractical, or unethical.  Id.  However, here, the January 2025 "Motion to Withdraw as Attorney" failed to comply with the provisions as set forth under 38 C.F.R. § 20.6(a)(2) for a withdrawal of representation after an AMA appeal has been filed to the Board.  Specifically, the Veteran's attorney has not presented any good cause for the attempted withdrawal of representation.  As such, the Board finds that the attorney's January 2025 "Motion to Withdraw as Attorney" fails to demonstrate "good cause" for the withdrawal of representation and would adversely impact the Veteran's interests.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.631(c), 20.6(a)(2).  Therefore, the Board concludes that Sean A. Kendall, Attorney, continues to represent the Veteran in the present matter.  The Veteran's attorney is encouraged to submit "good cause" for any attempted withdrawal of representation, or in the alternative, the Veteran can revoke the attorney's representation at any time.   

I.  VA'S DUTY TO NOTIFY AND ASSIST

VA's duty to notify under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) was satisfied by an attachment included with the June 2023 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ) and by an additional June 2023 letter for the MUCMI claim.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (2024).  This attachment and letter advised the Veteran of the information and evidence necessary to substantiate his service connection claims on appeal.  Moreover, the Veteran is represented by an attorney who is presumed to have an adequate, if not comprehensive, knowledge of VA disability law.

Under the AMA, the Board may still remand issues to the AOJ, but only to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors it identifies (such as an inadequate VA examination or missing treatment records), OR "any other" AOJ error to satisfy a statutory or regulatory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 20.802(a) (2024).  

Regardless, neither the Veteran nor his attorney has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist for the service connection issues being adjudicated in the present Board decision.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).  

In fact, neither the Veteran nor his attorney has alleged that additional development was necessary for any of the service connection issues on appeal, for any error occurring prior to the March 3, 2024, AMA rating decision on appeal.  See again 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 20.802(a).

With regard to securing VA examinations with medical opinions addressing the etiology of any potential allergic rhinitis and sleep apnea disabilities, the Board is aware of the Veteran's allegation that he participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during his period of service from 1992 to 1993 due to Persian Gulf environmental hazards such as burn pits and other toxins (BPOT).  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1117, 1119, 1120; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  Although VA has an obligation to obtain medical VA opinions for any service connection claim which cannot be granted where there is evidence of a TERA and symptoms of a disability, the Board in the present decision has determined that the Veteran did not serve in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s.  As such, a VA TERA opinion for the alleged allergic rhinitis and sleep apnea disabilities is not required here.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1168(a), 1710(e)(4), 5103A(d); VBA Letter 20-24-06, Updated Guidance on Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 89 Fed. Reg. 51224 (June 17, 2024).  The lack of probative evidence in the claims file corroborating service in the Persian Gulf or in Afghanistan or in other locations for the Veteran will be explained in detail below. 

Therefore, the Board is satisfied that VA has provided all assistance required by the VCAA, for the service connection issues being denied in the present Board decision.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A.  

II.  DISMISSAL OF MULTIPLE CLAIMS

In a December 2014 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for the following: bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy, RIGHT knee arthritis, LEFT knee joint pain, RIGHT elbow joint pain, LEFT elbow joint pain, plantar fasciitis of the feet, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), migraine headaches, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with insomnia, unspecified personality disorder, sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and fibromyalgia.  In the same December 2014 rating decision, the AOJ also denied entitlement to a TDIU.  The Veteran was notified of the December 2014 rating decision and of his appellate rights, but he did not submit an informal or formal NOD within one year of the notice of this rating decision.  Also, the Veteran did not request an extension of time to file an NOD.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1) (2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.109, 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.201, 20.302(a) (2014).  

However, within one year of the December 2014 rating decision, the AOJ secured relevant VA treatment records that provided new and material evidence to reopen the above claims for service connection.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362, 1367-68 (Fed. Cir. 2011).  In this regard, although the definitions of new and material evidence appear in subsection (a) of the regulation, they apply to subsection (b) of § 3.156 as well.  See Voracek v. Nicholson, 421 F.3d 1299, 1304-05 (Fed. Cir. 2005).  

As such, in a subsequent March 2015 rating decision, under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), the AOJ reopened the following service connection claims based on a finding that new and material evidence had been secured within one year of the previous December 2014 rating decision: service connection for bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy, RIGHT knee arthritis, LEFT knee joint pain, RIGHT elbow joint pain, LEFT elbow joint pain, plantar fasciitis of the feet, hypertension, migraine headaches, PTSD with insomnia, unspecified personality disorder, sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and fibromyalgia.  However, in the same March 2015 rating decision, after reopening these service connection claims, the AOJ denied all of the above service connection claims on the merits.  In addition, in the March 2015 rating decision, the AOJ continued to deny the Veteran entitlement to a TDIU.  The Veteran was notified of the March 2015 rating decision and of his appellate rights, but he did not submit an NOD, or new and material evidence, within one year of the notice of the March 2015 rating decision.  Also, the Veteran did not request an extension of time to file an NOD.  Therefore, the March 2015 rating decision became final for the above service connection and TDIU issues.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.104, 3.109, 3.156(b), 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.201, 20.302, 20.1103 (2015).  

Several years later, in a May 2017 rating decision, the AOJ reopened the service connection claim for PTSD with insomnia based on a finding that new and material evidence had been submitted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).  In the same May 2017 rating decision, after reopening this service connection claim, the AOJ continued to deny service connection for PTSD with insomnia on the merits.  

In the same May 2017 rating decision, the AOJ determined that new and material evidence had not been submitted to reopen the following claims for service connection: bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy, RIGHT knee arthritis, RIGHT elbow joint pain, plantar fasciitis of the feet, hypertension, GERD, migraine headaches, unspecified personality disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and fibromyalgia.  In addition, in the May 2017 rating decision, the AOJ continued to deny the Veteran entitlement to a TDIU.  

The Veteran was notified of the May 2017 rating decision and of his appellate rights, but he did not submit an NOD, or new and material evidence, within one year of the notice of the May 2017 rating decision for the above service connection and TDIU issues.  Incidentally, effective March 24, 2015, VA will only accept issues listed on a timely VA Form 21-0958 (Formal NOD), in cases where the AOJ provides the form for the purpose of initiating an appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.201 (2017).  In this regard, in the notice letter for the May 2017 rating decision, the AOJ enclosed a VA Form 21-0958 (formal NOD).  Nevertheless, in the present case, neither an informal NOD nor a formal NOD (VA Form 21-0958) was submitted by the Veteran within one year of the May 2017 rating decision for any of the above issues.  Also, the Veteran did not request an extension of time to file an NOD.  Therefore, the May 2017 rating decision became final for the above service connection and TDIU issues.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.104, 3.109, 3.156(b), 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.201, 20.302, 20.1103 (2017).  The Court has held that in determining whether new and material evidence has been submitted to reopen a claim, it is necessary to consider all evidence added to the record since the last time the claim was denied on any basis, including on the basis of the absence of new and material evidence.  See Evans v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 273, 283 (1996) (emphasis added).

The AMA applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400(a)(1), 19.2(a)-(b).

Under the AMA, a claimant who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) at any time after the issuance of that VA decision, regardless of whether the original claim is pending or has become final (i.e., finally adjudicated like the issues above).  If new and relevant evidence (NRE) is received within or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the claim is to be readjudicated on the merits, taking into consideration all of the evidence of record, only limited by the evidentiary docket selected by the claimant.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.160(c)-(d), 3.2500, 3.2501.  

At the outset, in an August 2022 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ), the Veteran filed a claim to readjudicate the previously denied issues of service connection for PTSD, GERD, and RIGHT knee arthritis.  A few months later, in a June 2023 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ), the Veteran filed another claim to readjudicate the previously denied issues of service connection for PTSD, GERD, RIGHT knee arthritis, bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, and bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy.  The Veteran was also considered to have filed a new claim for entitlement to a TDIU.  The AOJ responded to the Veteran's claims with August 2022 and June 2023 VA notification letters, in which the Veteran was advised by the AOJ that it had previously denied the above service connection and entitlement to a TDIU issues.  The AOJ also advised the Veteran that VA regulations require him to file the request to readjudicate these issues on the proper form.  In particular, the Veteran was instructed that he must file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995), with new and relevant evidence (NRE) included, for VA to consider the above issues.  The AOJ concluded by stating that it will take no further action on these particular issues until the Veteran has submitted a completed Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995). 

On this point, despite the August 2022 and June 2023 VA notification letters from the AOJ, the Veteran failed to submit the necessary Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) requesting that the AOJ readjudicate the above issues of service connection for PTSD, GERD, RIGHT knee arthritis, bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, and bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy, as well as entitlement to a TDIU.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.156(d), 3.160(a)(6), 3.2500(a)(2), 3.2501 (2024).  In addition, no NRE was presented or secured in order to readjudicate the above issues.  As such, the AOJ could not, and therefore did not, attempt to readjudicate the above issues in the March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5108(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(a)(6), 3.2501.  

The Board now turns to the central focus of this appeal - the Veteran's untimely attempt in his May 2024 NOD / VA Form 10182 to appeal to the Board many of the service connection issues previously denied in the earlier, final legacy rating decisions dated in December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017.  

That is, in the May 2024 NOD / VA Form 10182, the Veteran stated his intent to appeal the bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy, RIGHT knee arthritis, LEFT knee joint pain, RIGHT elbow joint pain, LEFT elbow joint pain, plantar fasciitis of the feet, hypertension, GERD, migraine headaches, PTSD with insomnia, unspecified personality disorder, sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, and TDIU issues previously denied by the AOJ in the earlier, final legacy rating decisions dated in December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017. 

On this point, a "legacy" rating decision is one in which VA provided notice of the rating decision prior to the effective date of the modernized review system (prior to February 19, 2019), and the claimant has not elected to participate in the modernized review system as provided in paragraph (c) of section 3.2400.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400(b), 19.2(a), (c).  

Upon review of the evidence, the issues of whether new and relevant evidence (NRE) have been received to readjudicate the previously denied claims of service connection for bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy, RIGHT knee arthritis, LEFT knee joint pain, RIGHT elbow joint pain, LEFT elbow joint pain, plantar fasciitis of the feet, hypertension, GERD, migraine headaches, PTSD with insomnia, unspecified personality disorder, sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and fibromyalgia, are dismissed.

Upon review of the evidence, the issue of whether new and relevant evidence (NRE) has been received to readjudicate the previously denied claim of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities is dismissed.

Under the earlier Legacy appeal provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2012), an appeal to the Board after an initial AOJ rating decision must be initiated by a NOD and completed by a substantive appeal (VA Form 9 or equivalent), after a Statement of the Case (SOC) is furnished to the claimant.  In essence, the following sequence is required: there must be a rating decision by the AOJ, the claimant must express timely disagreement with the decision (a NOD), VA must respond by explaining the basis of the decision to the claimant (a SOC), and finally the claimant, after receiving adequate notice of the basis of the decision, must complete the process by stating his or her argument in a timely-filed substantive appeal (VA Form 9 or equivalent).  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 19.20, 19.21, 19.22, 19.52.  Proper completion and filing of a substantive appeal are the last actions a claimant needs to take to perfect an appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 19.22; see also Roy v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 554 (1993).  Subsequently, certification of the issue on appeal to the Board by the AOJ by way of a VA Form 8 (Certification of Appeal) should occur for administrative purposes.  See 38 C.F.R. § 19.35.  

In the legacy system, an informal or formal NOD "shall" be filed within one year of notice of a rating decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1) (2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.201, 20.302(a) (2014).  

However, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.109 (2014), time limits for filing to challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended in some cases on a showing of "good cause."  Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) requires that, where an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit (after expiration of the one-year appeal period for the NOD), the required action must be taken concurrent with or prior to the filing of a request for extension of the time limit, and good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was.  In short, the time to file an NOD may be extended, or an NOD may be filed out of time, only when 38 U.S.C. § 3.109(b) is applied.  Mason v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 44, 54 (1995).  However, there is no legal entitlement to an extension of time; rather, 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) leaves the decision to the sole discretion of VA.  Corry v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 231, 235 (1992).  The determination as to whether these requirements are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and an evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Despite the above procedural rules for filing an NOD, the Court has held that "[a]lthough VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings in appropriate circumstances, none of this affects the Board's jurisdiction to hear appeals of veterans benefits decisions."  Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 330 (2021).  More recently, the Court determined that the one-year deadline under 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b) to file an NOD in the legacy system is not a jurisdictional bar to Board review.  Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024).  That is, it does not place a jurisdictional limit on the Board.  Id.  Rather, the one-year deadline to file a NOD in the legacy system is an important and mandatory "claim-processing rule."  Id.  But it does not deprive the Board of the authority to consider the merits of an appeal simply because the NOD is received late.  Id.  

As a non-jurisdictional claim-processing rule, the one-year deadline to file an NOD in the legacy system may be extended pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) if a motion for an extension of time to submit the NOD is filed and good cause is shown.  The CAVC has not embraced the equitable tolling doctrine for VA filings.  Rather, analysis as to whether to accept an untimely NOD in the legacy system must be within the framework of a motion for an extension of time for good cause - 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).  

An exception to enforcement of claims-processing rules exists if a claimant establishes "an adequate excuse" for the NOD's untimeliness, such as an extension request with good cause, waiver, forfeiture, or any other relevant factor.  Ferko, 37 Vet. App. at 269; Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 333-34.

Applying this law to the facts of the present case, as already discussed in detail above, the Veteran's May 2024 NOD / VA Form 10182 was untimely submitted more than one year after the earlier, final legacy rating decisions dated in December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(a)(1)(ii), 20.203(b) (2024).  In the May 2024 NOD / VA Form 10182, the Veteran attempted to appeal to the Board the following issues in an untimely manner: service connection for bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy, RIGHT knee arthritis, LEFT knee joint pain, RIGHT elbow joint pain, LEFT elbow joint pain, plantar fasciitis of the feet, hypertension, GERD, migraine headaches, PTSD with insomnia, unspecified personality disorder, sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, and entitlement to a TDIU.  All of these issues had been previously denied in earlier, final legacy rating decisions dated in December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017.  But no informal NOD or formal NOD was submitted within one year of the December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017 rating decisions.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1) (2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.201, 20.302(a) (2014).  In fact, no informal NOD or formal NOD under the legacy system was submitted at all by the Veteran pertaining to the earlier, final December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017 rating decisions.  

Also, the claims file contains no request from the Veteran for an extension of time to file an NOD for the earlier, final December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017 rating decisions.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).  And no good cause was presented as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner.  Id.  Simply stated, the Veteran did not file a request for an extension of time to submit an NOD based on good cause, and did not proffer any reason as to why he did not file a timely NOD within one year of the earlier December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017 rating decisions.  

Furthermore, the mandatory claims-processing rule for a timely NOD has not been waived or forfeited by VA.  See Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 334 ("If it dismisses his claim, the Board should identify the governing law, any formal defects in the appeal, whether waiver or forfeiture is a relevant consideration, and any other relevant factors").  The Board declines to do so based on the facts and circumstances of the present case, wherein neither the AOJ nor the Board has engaged in any action, explicit or implicit, constituting waiver or forfeiture of the mandatory claims-processing rule for filing a timely NOD.  Accord Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46 (discussing VA's actions in that case in finding VA had treated the substantive appeal as timely filed).  To the extent that the Board sent a May 15, 2024, docketing letter advising the Veteran that the Board "received your Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) [and] your appeal has been placed on the Direct Review docket" - this is a ministerial letter and does not constitute waiver of enforcement of the mandatory claims-processing rule to file a legacy NOD within one year.  In this vein, the May 15, 2024, Board docketing letter contains neither discussion of the facts nor applicable VA law and regulations concerning timeliness of the Veteran's NOD.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C) ("[a] question as to timeliness of the notice of disagreement shall by decided by the Board).  Additionally, the Board did not continue to develop the above NRE / service connection / TDIU issues once the Board docketed the appeal in May 2024 through the Direct Review Lane, or direct review of the same evidence considered by the AOJ.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301.  Indeed, VA has not taken any action for this claim, such as accepting hearing testimony or an extension request, that would lead the Veteran to believe the earlier service connection and TDIU claims at issue were somehow not subject to the one-year time limit requirement for filing a NOD, and there is otherwise no basis for waiver or forfeiture of the relevant claims-processing rule in this case.  Moreover, this is the first opportunity for the Board to review the Veteran's May 3, 2024, NOD / VA Form 10182 requesting that the Board readjudicate the earlier rating decisions of the AOJ dated in December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017.  As such, the Board could not have taken any action construable as forfeiting enforcement of the claims-processing rule to file a legacy NOD within one year of the earlier rating decisions.

In the instant case, the May 3, 2024, NOD / VA Form 10182 was received more than one year after the earlier, final December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017 legacy rating decisions.  The claims file contains no timely document that can be reasonably construed as a disagreement with the earlier December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017 rating decisions and a desire for appellate review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201; Gallegos v. Gober, 283 F.3d 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Jarvis v. West, 12 Vet. App. 559, 561 (1999) (what constitutes an NOD should be "liberally construed").  The Veteran has not argued otherwise, and this appears to be uncontroverted.  And a written request for an extension of time to file an NOD has not been filed with the Board.  The "one-year" claims processing rule at issue here is a valuable rule that promotes finality of decisions and judicial economy.  No exception to the applicable claims-processing rule applies in the light of the facts and circumstances of this Veteran's case.  Furthermore, the Board has not waived the procedural defect or its ability to enforce the rule.  

Accordingly, the issues of whether new and relevant evidence (NRE) have been received to readjudicate the previously denied claims of service connection for bilateral LOWER extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral UPPER extremity peripheral neuropathy, RIGHT knee arthritis, LEFT knee joint pain, RIGHT elbow joint pain, LEFT elbow joint pain, plantar fasciitis of the feet, hypertension, GERD, migraine headaches, PTSD with insomnia, unspecified personality disorder, sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, and entitlement to a TDIU, are dismissed for failure to comply with the appropriate claims-processing rules.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1) (2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.109, 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.201, 20.302(a) (in effect from 2014 to 2017).  

In so holding, the Board clarifies that this appeal is not being dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, but rather for a procedural defect - failure to comply with a mandatory claims processing rule.  It follows that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) do not apply here, in terms of notice and the opportunity to present evidence and argument, including the opportunity for a hearing, must be provided to all parties when the Board raises a question as to a "potential" jurisdictional defect.  In this regard, § 20.104(c) pertains to "jurisdictional authority" and not to "claims processing rules" defects, such as the scenario in the instant case.  Moreover, docketing an appeal at the Board is a ministerial act and has no implications as to whether the Board accepted an appeal for merits review.  Martin v. O-Rourke, 891 F.3d 1338, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Nevertheless, even if § 20.104(c) was to apply, there is no question as to a "potential" jurisdictional defect, rather an actual and evident defect on the face of the record.  See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (strict adherence to requirements of law is not warranted when adherence would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran). 

On a final side note, in the May 2024 NOD / VA Form 10182 at issue, the Veteran also attempted to appeal (to the Board) the additional issues of service connection for depression and a skin rash, which had been denied in a previous December 2022 rating decision.  This request was untimely under the AMA, as the May 2024 NOD / VA Form 10182 was not filed within one year of the December 2022 rating decision.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(a)(1)(ii), 20.203(b) (2024).  Moreover, this attempted appeal was redundant and unnecessary, as the Veteran had previously filed separate, timely December 2022 and January 2023 NODs / VA Forms 10182 for these same issues, within one year of the December 2022 rating decision.  Accordingly, under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), the prohibition against a concurrent election under the AMA, i.e., requesting review of a claim under one lane while a request for review of that claim under another lane is pending review, applies here.  See also Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  In fact, in response to the earlier, timely December 2022 and January 2023 NODs / VA Forms 10182 filed by the Veteran in for these issues, the Board in a December 2024 Board decision already adjudicated and granted the issue of service connection for a skin rash.  What's more, in the same December 2024 Board decision, the Board already remanded the issue of service connection for depression for further development.  As such, these particular service connection issues are not on appeal before the Board at the present time, due to the prohibition against a concurrent election under the AMA.  Hence, they require no further discussion.  (Technically, they could also be dismissed as well). 

III.  PRESUMPTIVE SERVICE CONNECTION (SC) FOR ALLERGY RHINITIS / SINUSITIS

The Veteran contends that he has allergic rhinitis / sinusitis resulting from exposure to various toxic chemical and environmental hazards during his alleged service in Southwest Asia during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1992 and 1993.  That is, the Veteran has reported to VA clinicians that during his period of active duty in the Air Force, he was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield / Desert Storm from November 1992 to August 1993.  He says he worked in "combat rescue" during this timeframe.  He maintains that he rescued bodies from downed helicopters.  He states that each day he served in the Persian Gulf, he was within 10 feet of burn pits.  See January 2014 VA mental health initial evaluation note; February 2014 VA mental health medication management note; February 2014 VA chronic fatigue examination; and June 2023 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ). 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the "nexus" requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d), disorders diagnosed after discharge may also still be service connected if all the evidence, including pertinent service records, establishes the disorder was incurred in service.  See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

VA is to give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  Thus, there is no categorical rule that medical evidence is required when the determinative issue is either the existence of a current disability or a nexus to service.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  

In determining whether service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  38 U.S.C. 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1991).  

Upon review of the evidence, service connection for allergic rhinitis or sinusitis on a presumptive basis only, as a qualifying chronic disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, OR as due to exposure to fine particulate matter under the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320, is denied.

At the outset, under the AMA, in light of the Veteran's choice of the Direct Review Lane, the Board will focus on the evidence of record dated prior to March 4, 2024 (the date of the AMA rating decision).  See again 38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801(a).  

At the outset, in the March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made NO favorable findings pertinent to the service connection claim at issue for allergic rhinitis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103(f)(4), 3.104(c), 20.801(a).  

With regard to the Persian Gulf presumption, service connection is granted for Persian Gulf veterans suffering from a chronic disability resulting from (1) an undiagnosed illness or from (2) a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI) that became manifest during active duty in the Southwest Asia theater of operations or became manifest to a compensable degree within the prescribed presumptive period.  38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  Moreover, "[s]igns or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower)" are listed among the possible manifestations of an undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI) for purposes of presumptive service connection for a Persian Gulf veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 1117(g)(8); 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b)(8).  

However, with regard to the Persian Gulf presumption, the Board is cognizant of the recent August 2022 passage of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), Pub. L. No. 117-168, § 303, 136 Stat. 1759, 1779 (2022).  See also 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120.  The PACT Act is a historic new law that expands VA health care and benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances.  In any event, Section 405 of the PACT Act eliminates the manifestation period and the degree to which a qualifying chronic disability must manifest to be presumed as due to service in the Persian Gulf.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1).  Thus, an undiagnosed illness and a medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (MUCMI) may now manifest at any time and to any degree (including to a noncompensable degree).  Id.  Therefore, under the Persian Gulf presumption, there is no longer a requirement for a chronic disability to manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more prior to an end date (currently December 31, 2026), despite the wording of the current VA regulation to the contrary.  See again 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1)(i) (2024).  That is, under the newest version of the Persian Gulf statute (38 U.S.C. § 1117), the end date of December 31, 2026, is no longer applicable, and the presumptive Persian Gulf condition may now manifest to any degree at any time.  A forthcoming regulatory change will remove the outdated, contrary provisions.  See VBA Letter 20-24-06 at pages 18-19.  

For purposes of establishing the Veteran's status as a "Persian Gulf veteran," under the applicable VA regulation, the term "Persian Gulf veteran" means a veteran who served on active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(1).  The term "Southwest Asia theater of operations" refers to Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and the airspace above these locations.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(2).  The period of war for the Persian Gulf War is August 2, 1990, through date to be prescribed by Presidential proclamation or law.  38 U.S.C. § 101(33); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2(i). 

For purposes of establishing the Veteran's status as a "Persian Gulf veteran," under the applicable VA statute, the definition of "Persian Gulf Veteran" now includes several additional locations.  That is, the term "Persian Gulf veteran" means a veteran who not only served on active duty in the Armed Forces in the Southwest Asia theater of operations as listed above, but also served in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, or Jordan, during the Persian Gulf War.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1117(f).  

That withstanding, after a detailed review of the medical and lay and other evidence of record, the Board has determined that the Veteran did not serve in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations or in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, or Jordan during the Persian Gulf War.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(33), 1117(f); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(i), 3.317(e).  It follows that even if he was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis or sinusitis or a similar undiagnosed illness or MUCMI (which he is not), he would not be entitled to the presumption of service connection available for veterans exposed to toxic substances or environmental hazards in the Persian Gulf during active service.

The Board must determine, as a question of fact, both the weight and credibility of the evidence.  See Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346, 356 (2016).   Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in a record; every item does not have the same probative value.  The Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of all material evidence submitted by and on behalf of a claimant, account for the evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Struck v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 145, 152 (1996); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995).  

After the Board determines that lay evidence is competent, it must assess, as finder of fact, the credibility of the evidence.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 at 308 (2007) (observing that once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible).  Credible testimony or lay evidence is that which is plausible or capable of being believed. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995).  Credibility determinations of a witness are multifaceted and require consideration of factors such as: bias; inconsistent statements; bad character; internal inconsistency of statements; facial plausibility; self-interest; impairment in memory, consistency with other evidence of record; malingering; desire for monetary gain; and demeanor of the witness.  See Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346, 356 (2016).  Evidence can be found not credible in light of its own inherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of evidence.  Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  Personal interest may affect the credibility of the evidence.  Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991).  

However, definitions of credibility do not necessarily confine that concept to the narrow peg of truthfulness.  Indiana Metal Prods. v. NLRB, 442 F.2d 46, 52 (7th Cir. 1971).  Credibility has been termed as "the quality or power of inspiring belief."  Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1966).  "Credibility involves more than demeanor.  It apprehends the over-all evaluation of testimony in the light of its rationality or internal consistency and the manner in which it hangs together with other evidence."  Carbo v. United States, 314 F.2d 718, 749 (9th Cir. 1963).

It is completely within the Board's discretion to weigh the evidence and assign probative value to the evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (noting that the Board, as fact finder, is responsible for assessing the credibility, competence, and probative value of evidence).  

The Federal Circuit Court has held that the Board should not merely list the positive and negative evidence of record.  Rather, in a benefit-of-the-doubt analysis under 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), the proper approach is for VA to assign probative value to the key evidence and then determine whether the evidence persuasively favored one side or the other.  Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F.4th 1369, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2023).  There is no specific manner in which the review of evidence must be performed.  Roane v. McDonough, 64 F.4th 1306, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2023).  

With regard to the favorable lay evidence in support of service in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s, the Board has considered the Veteran's lay assertions to VA medical providers throughout the appeal.  In this regard, the Veteran has reported to VA clinicians that during his period of active duty in the Air Force, he was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield / Desert Storm from November 1992 to August 1993.  He says he worked in "combat rescue" during this timeframe, although he adds that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was classified as "supply."  He maintains that he rescued bodies from downed helicopters.  On one rescue patrol, he asserts he sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) from an enemy blast (the AOJ has denied the Veteran service connection for a TBI).  He also states that each day he served in the Persian Gulf he was within 10 feet of burn pits.  See January 2014 VA mental health initial evaluation note; February 2014 VA mental health medication management note; February 2014 VA chronic fatigue examination; and June 2023 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ).  

With regard to the favorable lay evidence in support of service in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s, the Veteran first reported serving in combat in Desert Storm / the Persian Gulf in a June 2013 VA urgent care note.  See also November 2013 VA mental health homeless screening and triage note; December 2013 VA CWT note.  In a January 2014 PTSD stressor statement (VA Form 21-0781), the Veteran wrote that he was deployed to Kuwait in 1992 and 1993 in the Persian Gulf, at which time he witnessed dead bodies, hostile enemy fire, and downed helicopters.  In a January 2014 Veteran statement, he expressed his desire to file additional service connection claims based on exposure to Persian Gulf War "environmental hazards."  At a February 2014 VA knee examination, the Veteran stated that he injured his right knee in 1992 while on deployment to Iraq.  He saw the field doctor in Iraq, who wrapped his right knee in an ace bandage and gave him pain meds and put him back in the field (but no STRs document this right knee injury in Iraq, and the AOJ has denied the Veteran service connection for the right knee).  In a September 2014 VA mental health note, the Veteran advised he was a "combat" veteran of the Air force and was involved in the Persian Gulf war.  In a January 2019 VA mental health homeless screen / triage note and in a VA homeless program note, the Veteran reported PTSD from combat exposure during the Persian Gulf War (the AOJ has denied the Veteran service connection for PTSD).

With regard to the favorable lay evidence in support of service in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s, in a May 2019 VA addendum note, the Veteran reported that his job title was a "combat medic" while-serving in Desert Storm (however, his service personnel records and DD Form 214 are negative for any clinical training or MOS duties involving a medic position).  On this point, the Board must first establish a proper foundation for drawing inferences against a claimant from an absence of documentation.  Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 239 (2012).  In the present case, an MOS as a medic and the necessary training that would accompany such an MOS are items that would normally be documented in the Veteran's service personnel records.  Yet in the present case, they were not, providing evidence against the claim.  In an August 2022 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ) and in a June 2023 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ), the Veteran sought service connection for a MUCMI based on alleged service in the Persian Gulf War.  He noted the "environment" of the Persian Gulf. 

Conversely, the Board now turns to consideration of the evidence of record that fails to support the Veteran's allegation of service in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s.  In this vein, in SPRs and STRs dated from 1992 to 1993, there is no mention of the Veteran serving in the Persian Gulf, to include in Kuwait and Iraq.  Rather, his only documented foreign service was in Okinawa, Japan.  He did not receive any medals supportive of service in the Persian Gulf, such as the Southwest Asia Service Medal or the Kuwait Liberation Service Medal.  His DD Form 214 only notes that he served "in support of" Operation Desert Shield / Desert Storm.  His SPRs and DD Form 214 also record that his MOS was a material storage and distribution apprentice.  There is no indication that he received the proper training for or engaged in the duties of a "combat medic" or a "combat rescue" service member.  His SPRs thus provide strong evidence against his lay assertions on this matter, as there is no logical reason why his SPRs would fail to document such significant duties and training, if they had actually occurred.  In a May 2014 response to a Request for Information (3101), the service department stated that all available records were shipped and loaded into VBMS in terms of any Southwest Asia service confirmation.

With regard to the negative evidence against service in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s, in an August 2014 VCAA letter, the AOJ asked the Veteran about his allegation of service in Iraq and Kuwait.  The AOJ advised that, thus far, it had been unable to find evidence of these particular assignments.  Therefore, the Veteran was asked to send in more detailed information on this matter.  The Veteran responded with a January 2015 PTSD stressor statement (VA Form 21-0781), in which he stated that he served at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, "in support of Operation Desert Shield / Storm" in 1992 and 1993.  But most importantly, in the same January 2015 PTSD stressor statement (VA Form 21-0781), the Veteran did not provide any assertion or indication that he was deployed to the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s, other than an allegation he received the Kuwait Liberation Medal (which neither his DD Form 214 nor SPRs document him receiving). 

With regard to the negative evidence against service in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s, a September 2014 Formal Finding (VA Form 21-0961) noted that SPRs do not contain evidence of service in Southwest Asia, Kuwait, or Iraq.  Likewise, an April 2017 Formal Finding (VA Form 21-0961) recorded no evidence of deployment to Operation Desert Storm / Desert Shield.  At a February 2014 VA psychological examination, the VA psychological examiner wrote that "there is a question of the veracity of some with his self-report given that he is reporting combat experiences when there is no evidence in any military records that he was ever associated with Southwest Asia experiences."  The February 2014 VA examiner added that the combat stories the Veteran told to a VA social worker are not confirmed by his STRs or SPRs, which are also negative for combat medals.  The VA examiner added that the Veteran served in Okinawa, Japan, as his only overseas duty station in the records available for review.  The VA examiner mentioned the Veteran also made comments suggesting that he was in air rescue while in the service, and he also alludes to stressful experiences recovering corpses in Southwest Asia.  However, the VA examiner surmised that the records available and reviewed indicate that there is neither evidence he served in Southwest Asia in the early 1990s, nor evidence he served in an air rescue capacity during that time.  To that end, a VA examiner is free to comment on perceived inconsistencies in the evidence, so long as the Board independently weighs that evidence itself, which the Board is accomplishing here. 

With regard to the negative evidence against service in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s, an April 2014 VA mental health note from a VA social worker surmised the Veteran had a "questionable" military service record as to the length of military stay as well as his combat status.  Moreover, a February 2024 VA Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum assessed no TERAs during active duty, with no confirmation of Persian Gulf service in the claims file.   

In light of the above, the most probative, persuasive evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran did not serve in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations or in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, or Jordan during the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1117(f); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(i), 3.317(e).  The only evidence of service in the Persian Gulf is the Veteran's own personal statements and his statements to VA medical providers, which have not been corroborated, and most importantly, are outweighed by the other evidence of record discussed in great detail above.  See Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36, 40 (2010) (pertaining to herbicide agent exposure).  There are inconsistencies between what the Veteran alleges his in-service MOS duties were (combat medic or combat rescue) and the locations he says he served in (Iraq and Kuwait) vs. the actual training and MOS duties he participated in (supply), as well as his actual foreign service location (Japan), as documented by his SPRs and STRs and other evidence of record.  Tellingly, a central factor of credibility for the Veteran's lay assertions that can be considered by the Board is "consistency with other evidence of record."  Southall-Norman, 28 Vet. App. at 356.  Stated another way, the Veteran's lay allegation that he served as a combat medic or in combat rescue in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s is inconsistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service in the Air Force.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  

It follows that even if he was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis or sinusitis or a similar undiagnosed illness or MUCMI (which he is not), he would not be entitled to the presumption of service connection available for veterans exposed to toxic substances or environmental hazards in the Persian Gulf during active service, pursuant to the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  

In addition, with regard to presumptive service connection, the Board has considered that on September 1, 2023, VA issued a final rule revising 38 C.F.R. § 3.320, Presumptive Service Connection for Respiratory Conditions Due to Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter.  See 88 Fed. Reg. 60336 (September 1, 2023).  Notably, both allergic rhinitis and sinusitis are listed as chronic diseases that shall be presumed service connected based on exposure to "fine particulate matter," if a veteran had a qualifying period of service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations or in other listed locations during the Persian Gulf War.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(ii) -(iii); 86 Fed. Reg. 42724 - 42733 (August 5, 2021).  The allergic rhinitis and sinusitis disabilities can manifest to any degree "at any time following" separation from a qualifying period of military service to qualify for presumptive service connection under these provisions.  38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(2). 

Regardless, presumptive service connection under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 for allergic rhinitis or sinusitis is not warranted here.  In this regard, as discussed in detail above, the Board has concluded that the Veteran did not have a qualifying period of service in the "Southwest Asia theater of operations" during the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(5)(i).  Moreover, the Veteran did not have a qualifying period of service in Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti, or Uzbekistan on or after September 19, 2001, during the Persian Gulf War.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(5)(ii).  Absent probative or persuasive evidence of active service in these locations during the Persian Gulf War, the Veteran is not presumed to have been exposed to fine, particulate matter under the provisions of under 38 C.F.R. § 3.320.  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.2(i).  Thus, presumptive service connection based on his alleged exposure to "fine particulate matter" in the Persian Gulf under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 cannot be awarded in the instant case and will be discussed no further.

Accordingly, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding of service connection for allergic rhinitis or sinusitis on a presumptive basis only, as a qualifying chronic disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, OR as due to exposure to fine particulate matter under the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1117, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.317, 3.320; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.  Therefore, the allergic rhinitis / sinusitis issue is denied on a presumptive basis only.

Nonetheless, this does not preclude the Veteran from establishing entitlement to service connection for any allergic rhinitis / sinusitis condition with proof of actual direct causation.  See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  As such, the theory of direct service connection for allergic rhinitis / sinusitis will be addressed in the REMAND section of this Board decision below.  

IV.  PRESUMPTIVE SERVICE CONNECTION (SC) FOR A MUCMI

As already listed above, with regard to the Persian Gulf presumption, service connection is granted for Persian Gulf veterans suffering from a chronic disability resulting from (1) an undiagnosed illness or from (2) a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI) that became manifest during active duty in the Southwest Asia theater of operations or became manifest to a compensable degree within the prescribed presumptive period.  38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  

A MUCMI is defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms, such as, but not limited to (1) chronic fatigue syndrome; (2) fibromyalgia; or (3) functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural gastrointestinal diseases). 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i)(B).

More specifically, the term "medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness" (MUCMI) means a diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology, that is characterized by overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory abnormalities.  Chronic multisymptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, will not be considered medically unexplained.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(ii).  

Under the proper interpretation of the law, the Court has held that an illness is a MUCMI where either the etiology or pathophysiology of the illness is inconclusive.  But a multi-symptom illness is not a MUCMI where both the etiology and the pathophysiology of the illness are partially understood (thus conclusive).  Stewart v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 383, 390 (2018).  For clarity, "pathophysiology" is defined as "the physiology of abnormal states; spec[ifically]: the functional changes that accompany a particular syndrome or disease."  See Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 1655 (1966); Stewart, 30 Vet. App. at 389-90, n.5.

Signs or symptoms which may be manifestations of undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (a MUCMI) include, but are not limited to: fatigue; signs or symptoms involving skin; headache; muscle pain; joint pain; neurological signs or symptoms; neuropsychological signs or symptoms; signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower); sleep disturbances; gastrointestinal signs or symptoms; cardiovascular signs or symptoms; abnormal weight loss; or menstrual disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b)(1)-(13).  As such, what can constitute a MUCMI disability is considered quite broad. 

In summary, if probative evidence exists that the Veteran served in the Persian Gulf during the Persian Gulf War, and the Veteran's disability pattern is either (1) an undiagnosed illness or (2) a diagnosable but medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (MUCMI) without conclusive etiology or pathophysiology, including but not limited to, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, or functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural gastrointestinal diseases), then service connection must be granted for a Persian Gulf War illness.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i) and (ii). 

Upon review of the evidence, service connection for a diagnosable but medically unexplained multi-symptom illness (MUCMI), to include as a qualifying chronic disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, is denied. 

At the outset, under the AMA, in light of the Veteran's choice of the Direct Review Lane, the Board will focus on the evidence of record dated prior to March 4, 2024 (the date of the AMA rating decision).  See again 38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801(a).  

At the outset, in the March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made NO favorable findings pertinent to the service connection claim at issue for a MUCMI.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103(f)(4), 3.104(c), 20.801(a).  

At the outset, as already analyzed above, the most probative, persuasive evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran did not serve in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations or in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, or Jordan during the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1117(f); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(i), 3.317(e).  It follows that even if he was diagnosed with an undiagnosed illness or a MUCMI, he would not be entitled to the presumption of service connection available for veterans exposed to toxic substances or environmental hazards in the Persian Gulf during active service, pursuant to the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1117 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  

However, the Board will also consider whether the Veteran has any disability resembling or similar to a MUCMI on a direct basis.  This particular issue turns on whether the Veteran has identified a current disability, or whether a current disability can be interpreted from the clinical evidence of record. 

With regard to the existence of a current disability, Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a current disability.  The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1332 (1997).  In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  

However, more recently, the Federal Circuit Court provided a more definitive answer as to what constitutes a "disability" under VA law.  The Federal Circuit held that where pain causes functional impairment, a "disability" for VA compensation purposes can exist, even if there is no underlying diagnosis or pathology.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-68 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  The Federal Circuit explained that a "disability" under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 refers to the functional impairment in earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability.  Id. at 1363.  The Federal Circuit also noted that 38 C.F.R. § 4.10 defines the term "functional impairment" as the inability of the body or a part of it "'to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment'" Id.  

That notwithstanding, the Federal Circuit in Saunders limited its holding, by stating that a claimant's report of "subjective" pain in and of itself will not establish a current disability.  Id. at 1367.  In other words, a claimant cannot demonstrate service connection simply by asserting subjective pain.  Id.  Rather, a claimant will need to show that his or her pain reaches the level of functional impairment of earning capacity.  Consideration should be given to the impact, or lack thereof, from pain, focusing on evidence of functional limitation caused by pain.  The Court's holding in Saunders is supported by the public policy behind veterans' compensation - i.e., to compensate veterans whose ability to earn a living is impaired as a result of their military service.  Id. 

Subsequently, the Court further held that the Federal Circuit's decision in the Saunders case is not limited to pain within an orthopedic context only.  Rather, the definition of "disability" in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 (and by implication 38 U.S.C. § 1131) includes any "condition" that results in "functional impairment of earning capacity."  Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393, 398 (2020), aff'd sub nom. Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F.4th 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2022).  

Moreover, VA must fully and sympathetically develop a veteran's claim to its optimum, and that requires VA to determine all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations.  Moody v. Principi, 360 F.3d 1306, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that a claimant's identification of the benefit sought does not require technical precision.  See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 256-57 (2007).  Thus, the Board has considered all relevant symptoms and disorders identified in the record, when determining the nature and scope of the MUCMI claim.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (the scope of a psychiatric disability claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).  Importantly, this rule also applies to non-mental health conditions.  See Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009) (applying Clemons to a neurological disorder).  As the Court has noted, "[a] claimant is not required in filing a claim for benefits to identify a precise medical diagnosis or the medical cause of his condition; rather, he sufficiently files a claim for benefits 'by referring to a body part or system that is disabled or by describing symptoms of the disability.'"  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 53 (2011) (citations omitted).  

In fact, the Federal Circuit advised that in determining the scope of a claim, VA must look to all possible diagnoses, conditions, and illnesses that a pro se non-expert claimant could have reasonably expected to have included in their claim as well as the clinical evidence developed in processing that claim.  Murphy v. Wilkie, 983 F.3d. 1313, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  Thus, the Board has tried to address every disabling condition reasonably raised within the current MUCMI appeal.  This is especially true given that there are a broad array of signs or symptoms which can be manifestations of an "undiagnosed illness" or "medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness."  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b).

The most probative evidence of record weighs against the existence of a current disability involving a diagnosable but medically unexplained multi-symptom illness (MUCMI).  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Saunders, 886 F.3d 1363-68.  As pertinent to this point, both the lay and clinical evidence of record fail to demonstrate functional impairment of earning capacity due to symptomatology from any MUCMI.  Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1367-68.  

With regard to lay evidence of a current disability, in an August 2022 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ), the Veteran first filed a formal claim for "Gulf War Unexplained Chronic Multi-Symptom Illness."  The Veteran went on to specify he was seeking service connection for a skin rash condition that occurred while on active duty in the Air Force from 1992 to 1993.  However, in a December 2024 Board decision, the Board has already awarded the Veteran service connection for a "skin and rash" condition.  This skin condition was diagnosed as lymphohistiocytic dermatitis.  See September 2022 VA skin examination.  Since the time of service in 1992 and 1993, the Veteran has continued to experience symptoms of rash and itchiness, which wax and wane periodically.  In a December 2024 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the December 2024 Board decision, assigning the Veteran a 0 percent rating for a service-connected skin and rash disability (lymphohistiocytic dermatitis) under Diagnostic Code 7806.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 (2024).  Therefore, to the extent the Veteran alleges that his MUCMI is a skin condition, this disability has already been service connected by VA, and hence requires no further discussion here.

A "claim" means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary.   See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  A "complete claim" is a submission of an application form prescribed by the Secretary, whether paper or electronic must "identify the benefit sought" and must provide "a description of any symptom(s) or medical condition(s) on which the benefit is based" to the extent the form prescribed by the Secretary so requires.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a)(3)-(4).  

To the extent that a complete claim application encompasses a request for more than one determination of entitlement, each specific entitlement will be adjudicated and is considered a separate "issue" for purposes of the review options prescribed in § 3.2500.  A single decision by an AOJ may adjudicate multiple "issues" in this respect, whether expressly claimed or determined by VA to be reasonably within the scope of the application as prescribed in § 3.155(d)(2).  VA will issue a decision that addresses each such identified "issue" within a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.151(c)(1).  Importantly, with respect to service-connected disability compensation, an "issue" for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of § 3.151 is defined as entitlement to compensation "for a particular disability."  For example, if a decision adjudicates service-connected disability compensation for both a knee condition and an ankle condition, compensation for each condition is a separate entitlement or "issue" for which a different review option may be elected.  38 C.F.R. § 3.151(c)(2).  VA will consider all lay and medical evidence of record in order to adjudicate entitlement to benefits for the claimed condition as well as entitlement to any additional benefits for complications of the claimed condition.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2) (emphasis added).  VA's decision on an "issue" within a claim implies that VA has determined that evidence of record does not support entitlement for any other issues that are reasonably within the scope of the issues addressed in that decision.  Id. 

In the instant case, for the MUCMI issue, the Veteran has failed to "identify the benefit sought" or provide "a description of any symptom(s) or medical condition(s) on which the benefit is based" to the extent the form prescribed by the Secretary so requires.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a)(3)-(4).  In this regard, the Federal Circuit has held that if a pro-se claimant's filings refer to specific medical records, and those records contain a reasonably ascertainable diagnosis of a disability, the claimant has raised a claim for that disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a)) (in that he has identified the benefits sought).  Shea v. Wilkie, 926 F.3d 1362, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  That is, VA must look "beyond the four corners of [claims] documents when the documents themselves point elsewhere," such as to medical records.  Id. at 1369.  Shortly thereafter, the Shea case was subsequently constrained by Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328, 1337-38 (Fed. Cir. 2020), which held that "some measure" of specificity is required between a claim-stating document and the condition identified in the medical records, beyond a generalized request in the claim-stating document for "all possible benefits."  That is, the formal or informal claim form must point to or refer to specific medical records that discuss the sickness, disease, or injuries, in order to identify the benefit sought.  Id. 

Turning back to the facts of the present case, in the June 2023 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ), the Veteran sought service connection for a "Gulf War veteran with unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness."  This was allegedly due to an in-service exposure under the PACT Act.  However, the Veteran provided no further detail or guidance in his June 2023 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ) as to what actual disability / condition / disease / injury / signs and symptoms he was seeking service connection for.  Yet in the same June 2023 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ), he separately claimed service connection for sleep apnea, allergic rhinitis, GERD, peripheral neuropathy, a right knee condition, and tinnitus.  But he failed to elucidate what he meant by service connection for "Gulf War veteran with unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness."  

In fact, in a June 2023 VCAA letter, the AOJ advised the Veteran that it had received his VA Form 21-526EZ dated June 12, 2023.  The AOJ added that it was working on the Veteran's claim.  However, the AOJ stated it needed additional information from the Veteran.  The AOJ explained that on his June 12, 2023, Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ), the Veteran had listed "gulf war veteran with unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness."  The AOJ instructed the Veteran to "[p]lease clarify if there is a specific disability you want to claim?  It is important to clarify so we can address each contention appropriately.  You can use the attached VA Form 21-4138 or call the VA National Call Center at 1(800) 827-1000."  The AOJ further added that "[w]e strongly encourages you to send any information or evidence as soon as you can.  If we do not hear from you, we may make a decision on your claim after 30 days."  

The only response forthcoming from the Veteran to the AOJ's June 2023 VCAA inquiry letter was an October 2023 Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995), in which the Veteran sought service connection for a "skin and rash" condition.  (Once again, the Board already granted service connection for this disability in a December 2024 Board decision).  Tellingly, the Veteran failed to provide any probative lay description of the MUCMI he was seeking service connection for, despite the AOJ's specific request to do so.   

In the March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied service connection for "gulf war veteran with unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness."  The AOJ pointed out that the Veteran did not serve in the Southwest Asia theater of operations or in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, or Jordan during his period of active service from 1992 to 1993.  Thus, there was no evidence the Veteran was exposed to a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during his period of active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1168, 1710(e)(4).  The AOJ also reasoned that the evidence of record failed to reveal "a current diagnosed disability" due to any "unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness."  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  As such, service connection could not be granted for this particular claim.  

In his May 3, 2024, VA Form 10182 / NOD, the Veteran once again identified the specific issue he was appealing as a "gulf war veteran with unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness."  The Veteran added that this was a "fully developed claim."  However, the Veteran provided no further detail or guidance in his May 3, 2024, VA Form 10182 / NOD as to what actual disability / condition / disease / injury / signs and symptoms he was seeking service connection for. 

The Board is cognizant that previously, years earlier, in January 2014, January 2015, and July 2016 Applications for Compensation (VA Forms 21-526EZ), the Veteran filed claims for service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, and GERD.  On this point, the Board is aware that a MUCMI is defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms, such as, but not limited to (1) chronic fatigue syndrome; (2) fibromyalgia; or (3) functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural gastrointestinal diseases).  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i)(B).  That is, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, and GERD can constitute a MUCMI.  Yet the AOJ denied all three of these claims in unappealed, final December 2014, March 2015, and May 2017 rating decisions.  None of these disabilities were reasonably raised again in any subsequent claim, as will be discussed below.  

That is, in the more recent August 2022 and June 2023 Applications for Compensation (VA Forms 21-526EZ), the Veteran claimed service connection for "Gulf War veteran with unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness."  Regardless, the Veteran failed to reassert service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, or GERD in the current MUCMI claim on appeal.  The AOJ also did not reference any VA or private medical records describing treatment for these disabilities in the August 2022 and June 2023 Applications for Compensations (VA Forms 21-526EZ).  Instead, the Veteran mentioned in his June 2023 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ) that January 2023 VA treatment records from the Rocky Mountain VAMC in Denver, Colorado documented treatment for only his right knee.  As such, the August 2022 and June 2023 Applications for Compensation (VA Forms 21-526EZ) claiming service connection for an unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness have not reasonably raised a claim for service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, or GERD, or any other potential MUCMI.  

In summary, the Board has liberally and sympathetically construed the June 2023 Application for Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ) on appeal, in which the Veteran sought service connection for "Gulf War veteran with unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness."  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151(c), 3.155(d)(2), 3.160(a)(3)-(4); Sellers, 965 F.3d at 1337-38; Shea, 926 F.3d at 1367-70.  In this vein, VA must look "beyond the four corners of [claims] documents when the documents themselves point elsewhere," such as to medical records.  Shea, 926 F.3d at 1369.  The CAVC explained that the Board is obligated to consider the full context within which veterans' submission are made, including liberally construing the filings of pro se claimants.  See Rivera v. Shinseki, 654 F.3d 1377, 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011).  Regardless, even a sympathetic reading of the Veteran's various submissions does not indicate that he has identified a MUCMI disability manifesting in specific signs and symptoms, impacting a specific body part or system that is disabled, or causing functional impairment in earning capacity.  See Andrews v. Nicholson, 421 F.3d 1278, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004)) (finding that VA is obligated to sympathetically read the filings of a pro se Veteran).  That is, none of the Veteran's submissions for the MUCMI issue on appeal "identify the benefit sought" or provide "a description of any symptom(s) or medical condition(s) on which the benefit is based" or seek compensation "for a particular disability" or mention a body part or system that is disabled.  See again 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151(c)(2), 3.160(a)(3)-(4).  Likewise, a close review of accompanying VA treatment records dated from 2020 to 2024 also do not contain a reasonably ascertainable diagnosis for any MUCMI disability.  

Moreover, with regard to lay evidence, beyond his formal claims, the Veteran and his attorney neglected to proffer any additional, substantive factual or legal argument or request for further development for the issue of service connection for a MUCMI.  In determining the scope of a claim, VA is not required to read the minds of the Veteran or his representative.  Cintron v. West, 13 Vet. App. 251, 259 (1999).  A claimant cannot remain passive if he has relevant information in favor of his claim.  See Wamhoff v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 517 (1996).  The Court has reaffirmed that the duty to assist a claimant is not a one-way street.  Martinez v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 170, 178 (2019).  The duty to assist "does not encompass 'a duty to prove a claim with the claimant only in a passive role.' "Hilkert v. West, 12 Vet. App. 145, 151 (1999) (en banc).   

Once again, the existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997).  Absent probative or reliable evidence of a current MUCMI disability causing functional impairment in earning capacity due to specific symptomatology, service connection for the alleged MUCMI disability cannot be granted in the present case.  Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1367-68.

Accordingly, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding of service connection for a MUCMI, to include as a qualifying chronic disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.  Therefore, this service connection claim is denied.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the AMA, the Board may still remand issues to the AOJ, but only to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors it identifies (such as an inadequate VA examination or missing treatment records), OR "any other" AOJ error to satisfy a statutory or regulatory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 20.802(a) (2024).  Following correction of the error, the AOJ must readjudicate the issue or issues.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2502.  

In the present case, the service connection issues on appeal for allergic rhinitis / sinusitis and sleep apnea are remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the March 4, 2024, AMA rating decision.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 20.802(a).  That is, here, the Board concludes that pre-decisional duty to assist errors occurred for these service connection issues.  In this vein, the AOJ failed to secure a VA sinusitis / rhinitis examination and medical opinion and a VA sleep apnea examination and medical opinion to address the existence and etiology of these alleged disabilities.

1. Service connection for allergic rhinitis or sinusitis on a direct basis is REMANDED. 

Specifically, for the alleged allergic rhinitis / sinusitis disorder, the AOJ should schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to determine (1) if the Veteran has a current allergic rhinitis or sinusitis disability, and (2) if he does, whether this disability(ies) is causally or etiologically related to his period of active service in the Air Force from 1992 to 1993.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).  In this regard, the AOJ has not yet afforded the Veteran a VA examination or opinion for the allergic rhinitis / sinusitis issue on appeal.  Yet the duty to assist to provide a VA examination and opinion for allergic rhinitis / sinusitis has been triggered, as there is an "indication" that the clinically documented in-service treatment for upper respiratory infections (URIs) on several occasions may be associated with a confirmed post-service diagnoses of sinusitis in one instance.  See e.g., Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Colantonio v. Shinseki, 606 F.3d 1378, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i)(C).  

2. Service connection for sleep apnea is REMANDED.

Specifically, for the alleged sleep apnea disorder, the AOJ should schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to determine (1) if the Veteran has a current sleep apnea disability, and (2) if he does, whether this sleep apnea disability is causally or etiologically related to his period of active service in the Air Force from 1992 to 1993.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).  In this regard, the AOJ has not yet afforded the Veteran a VA examination or opinion for the sleep apnea issue on appeal.  Yet the duty to assist to provide a VA examination and opinion for sleep apnea has been triggered, as there are both in-service and post-service clinical reports of fatigue and sleep impairment, as well as post-service lay evidence of fatigue.  See e.g., Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Colantonio v. Shinseki, 606 F.3d 1378, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i)(C).  

Therefore, the above issues are REMANDED for the following action:

1. For the allergic rhinitis / sinusitis issue, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current existence and etiology of any current allergic rhinitis or sinusitis disabilities.  The VA examiner must review the claims file.  The Veteran must be interviewed.  Any and all studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the VA examiner should be performed, including any radiology testing.  The VA examiner must address the Veteran's relevant lay assertions, and if necessary, address whether the Veteran's lay assertions are consistent or inconsistent with his medical history and the clinical data.  Finally, the VA examiner must provide a clear rationale for the medical opinion.

The VA examiner must respond to the following inquiries:  

(a.) Does the Veteran have a current allergic rhinitis or sinusitis disability that reoccurs periodically?

(b.) If, and only if, the Veteran has a current allergic rhinitis or sinusitis disability, is it at least as likely as not (i.e., (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher)) that the Veteran's current allergic rhinitis or sinusitis disability began during service or is related to any incident of service, to include his multiple, clinically documented in-service complaints for upper respiratory infections (URIs) and other ENT symptomatology?  In rendering this opinion, the VA examiner should address whether the Veteran's documented, in-service treatment in his STRs in 1992 and 1993 for multiple URIs that included headaches, fever, fatigue, congestion, coughing, sore throat, and yellow phlegm, were an early indication or early manifestation of any current allergic rhinitis or sinusitis disability.

In rendering the above opinions, the VA examiner should focus on the following relevant evidence:

At the outset, the VA examiner is advised that the Board has concluded the Veteran did not serve in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, or Iraq) or in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, or Jordan during the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s.  Instead, he only served overseas at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, in 1992 and 1993 "in support of Operation Desert Shield / Storm".  Thus, he was NOT exposed to the various toxic chemical and environmental hazards that were present in the Persian Gulf during the Persian Gulf War.

The Veteran's STRs dated from 1992 ot 1993 confirm multiple instances of treatment for upper respiratory infections (URIs) and complaints of ENT symptoms.  That is, a September 1992 STR documented a high temperature (fever), headaches, fatigue, congestion, coughing, and yellow phlegm. The diagnosis was acute pharyngitis / viral URI.  The Veteran was administered Penicillin, Tylenol, Cepacol, Duravent, and Kool Aid.  In another September 1992 STR, the Veteran complained of a sore throat x four days.  The diagnosis was pharyngitis.  A September 1992 STR physical profile serial report (AF Form 422) instructed the Veteran to engage in no running and no PC until October 1992, due to a diagnosis of acute pharyngitis / viral syndrome.  An October 1992 STR assessed that his URI was resolving.  The Veteran was still taking Penicillin, cough drops, Duravent, and Tylenol.  In an August 12, 1993, STR chronological record of medical care, the Veteran reported aches and fatigue that began the day before.  The assessment was flu / URI.  The Veteran was provided medications.  In an August 13, 1993, STR chronological record of medical care, the Veteran continued to report aches / fatigue / dizziness due to the flu.  

The Veteran's June 1993 STR retirement examination revealed a normal head and nose and ears and throat.  

Post-service, in a December 2013 VA emergency department note, the Veteran presented for a one-week history of nasal congestion & drainage, sore throat, and coughing, which was sometimes productive (worse when laying down).  He had no fever.  He did not smoke.  The diagnosis was sinusitis / URI.  The Veteran was prescribed amoxicillin and Ocean saline spray.  

Post-service, December 2013 VA sinus X-rays mentioned mild tenderness in the muscle of the posterior occipital area extending to the left posterior cervical muscles.  The left portion was seen intact with the rest partially blocked by wax.  The right portion was completely blocked by cerumen.  The assessment was bilateral nasal obstruction (right 85% and left 75%) with enlarged turbinates.  

Post-service, VA treatment records dated in 2014 mentioned use of a nasal spray medication for nasal dryness.  

Post-service, VA treatment records dated from 2014 to 2024 are negative for any diagnosis of allergic rhinitis for the Veteran.  

2. For the sleep apnea issue, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the existence and etiology of any current sleep apnea disorder.  The VA examiner must review the claims file.  The Veteran must be interviewed.  Any and all studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the VA examiner should be performed, including any sleep studies.  The VA examiner must address the Veteran's relevant lay assertions, and if necessary, address whether the Veteran's lay assertions are consistent or inconsistent with his medical history and the clinical data.  Finally, the VA examiner must provide a clear rationale for the medical opinion

The VA examiner must respond to the following inquiries:  

(a.) Does the Veteran have a current sleep apnea disability? 

(b.) If a current sleep apnea disability exists, is it "at least as likely as not" (i.e., likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's current sleep apnea disability is causally or etiologically related to his period of service in the Air Force from 1992 to 1993?  

In rendering the above opinions, the VA examiner is advised of the following relevant evidence:

At the outset, the VA examiner is advised that the Board has concluded the Veteran did not serve in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, or Iraq) or in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, or Jordan during the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s.  Instead, he only served overseas at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, in 1992 and 1993 "in support of Operation Desert Shield / Storm".  Thus, he was NOT exposed to the various toxic chemical and environmental hazards that were present in the Persian Gulf during the Persian Gulf War.

STRs dated from 1992 to 1993 are negative for any complaint, treatment, or diagnosis of a sleep apnea disorder, daytime fatigue, snoring, or any other sleep apnea-related symptomatology.  At a June 1993 STR report of medical history at his retirement examination, the Veteran denied a history of frequent trouble sleeping.  However, STRs dated in September 1992 and August 1993 do document multiple instances of "fatigue" in the context of treatment for upper respiratory infections (URIs).  

Post-service, in a July 2016 TDIU Application (VA Form 21-8940), the Veteran asserted that an alleged mental health disability (PTSD) causes "loss of sleep at night."  In an August 2023 VA homeless program note, in the mental health history section as reported by the Veteran, he contended insomnia for most of his life, that was exacerbated by his time in the Air Force from 1992 to 1993. 

Post-service, at a February 2014 VA chronic fatigue examination, the Veteran indicated that as early as 1998 post-service he saw a private doctor for fatigue and exhaustion and memory loss.  (No private medical records are associated with the claims file).  

Post-service, in a June 2013 VA urgent care note, the Veteran reported chronic sleep problems since active duty in 1993.  In a December 2013 VA primary care note, the assessment was "Fatigue-Unknown cause, present for 'years'".  At a February 2014 VA chronic fatigue examination, the Veteran said that he began to feel fatigue while on active duty 1993.  In a February 2014 VA mental health medication management note, the Veteran discussed nightmares that occur twice per week.  His sleep generally is poor; he has trouble falling asleep and then is only able to get 4-5 hours of sleep per night.  At a February 2014 VA psychological examination, the Veteran commented that he stays asleep for about four hours and then he will feel fatigued during the day because he is not sleeping as well.  His daytime tiredness probably interferes with his difficulties in social relationships and at work.

Post-service, in VA treatment records dated from 2013 to 2024, the Veteran frequently reported insomnia, fatigue, and sleep difficulties in the context of treatment for his nonservice-connected anxiety and depression and nightmares.  The Veteran also takes multiple psychiatric medications that can cause sleepiness - Prazosin for nightmares, hydroxyzine HCL for anxiety, sertraline HCL for depression, and trazodone for sleep.
