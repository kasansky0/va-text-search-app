ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's plantar fasciitis is related to military service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1992 to March 1995.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claims of entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Veteran initially filed a VA Form 10182 in April 2024 and selected the direct review docket; however, the Veteran submitted additional evidence in connection with the VA Form 10182. A clarification letter was mailed to the Veteran in May 2024. In June 2024, the Veteran responded by filing the current VA Form 10182 and selecting the direct revie docket. Therefore, the Board will not consider any evidence added to the claims file after the March 2024 rating decision. 

The Board notes that the AOJ requested the Veteran submit any relevant private treatment records or submit information with which VA can assist the Veteran in obtaining private treatment records.  Required notice and information were provided in the claim form which the Veteran signed, certifying to the fact that such notice was received and further than they have included or identified relevant evidence. VA requested records for which the Veteran submitted a proper release and/or adequately identified. The duty to assist is not a one-way street. If a Veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining evidence. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). Thus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the duty to assist. No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in development. Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).

The standard set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) only permits constructive receipt of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records that not only existed prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, but also for which the claimant furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of those records. Thus, the Board's consideration of VHA records is limited to the same.  Here, the Board finds that VA treatment records were obtained and reviewed consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) and the AMA framework.

1. Entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis.

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to service connection for plantar fasciitis because it developed as a result of military service. In her June 2024 Fully Developed Claim the Veteran alleged that her bilateral plantar fasciitis is caused by running, jogging, and wearing boots in the military. 

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Evidence of record including an October 2023 VA examination establish that the Veteran has a current disability of bilateral plantar fasciitis. 

With respect to an in-service injury, November 1992 service treatment records note a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis; the Veteran was prescribed soft shoes for five days. 

Post service, as noted above, the Veteran was provided a VA examination in October 2023. The examiner opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis is related to military service. As supporting rationale, the examiner noted that the Veteran had one instance of plantar fasciitis in service in 1992; post service separation exam is silent for plantar fasciitis and the next documented complaint of foot pain with plantar fasciitis was in 2022, 27 years after military discharge.  The examiner concluded that "Without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology. Therefore, it is less likely than not that the claimed condition has direct service connection."

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a private opinion.  The clinician reviewed the Veteran's records and concluded that "it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's chronic bilateral foot pain and plantar fasciitis is directly related to her military service." In support of this conclusion the examiner noted that the Veteran experienced plantar fasciitis in service and has reported that over the years her pain has persisted and progressively worsened over time, prompting the Veteran to see a foot specialist. The clinician cited to medical literature which demonstrates that combat boots have consistently been associated with poor shock absorption leading to increased risk of injury.  Further, the clinician noted that the Veterans 2022 x-ray demonstrated bone spurs, showing that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis had been a long standing condition.

The Board affords probative weight to the private opinion of record because it is consistent with the evidence of record which shows that the Veteran experienced plantar fasciitis in service in 1992; the Veteran reported subjective complaints of ongoing foot pain in her June 2023 lay statement; and October 2022 private treatment records includes a finding that x-rays revealed calcification for heel spur syndrome. 

Based on the evidence of record, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of plantar fasciitis, and in-service injury noting plantar fasciitis in 1992 and a probative private opinion which finds a nexus between the two. Service connection for plantar fasciitis is established. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis is granted.
