DOCKET NO. 240416-433277
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to January 4, 2021 for the award of a total disability evaluation based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran filed an intent to file form which was received by VA on January 4, 2021.  The Veteran filed his claim for TDIU on November 9, 2021.  No claim for TDIU was filed prior to this date and the record does not support an inferred claim of TDIU prior to November 9, 2021.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to January 4, 2021 for the award of TDIU have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 5107, 5110, 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.104, 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.3, 4.15, 4.16, 4.19.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from May 1971 to April 1975.  He was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, among others.

Applicable Evidentiary Windows

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2023.  Therefore, the modernized review system, known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Under the Direct Review docket, the Board is authorized to review only the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the May 2023 rating decision.  The Board may not consider evidence presented outside of the timeframes discussed above.  Therefore, evidence provided following the May 2023 rating decision has not been considered by the Board in its decision on the claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to January 4, 2021 for the award of TDIU is denied.

The Veteran, through his attorney, contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU.  Specifically, the Veteran's attorney contends that "[t]he evidence of record demonstrates that his heart and mental health disabilities prevented him from working since at least February 21, 2017, the date that he met the schedular requirements for TDIU.  At that point TDIU was reasonably raised, but never adjudicated."  See Attorney argument within April 2024 VA Form 10182.

It is the established policy of VA that all Veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  A finding of total disability is appropriate "when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation."  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340(a)(1), 4.15.

TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total and it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of either (1) a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).  For the purposes of determining rating level, disabilities resulting from a common etiology or affecting a single body system are considered a single disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The central inquiry is, "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability."  Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).  The issue is not whether the Veteran can find employment generally, but whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).  Consideration may be given to the Veteran's education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

In determining whether a Veteran can secure, follow, and maintain a substantially gainful occupation, the Board must consider: (1) the Veteran's occupational history, education skill and training; (2) whether the Veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities require by the occupation at issue; and (3) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  Additionally, the responsibility for making the ultimate TDIU determination is placed on the adjudicator and not a medical clinician.  See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (2013).

The effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, shall be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).  An effective date for a reopened claim of entitlement to service connection can be no earlier than the date the request to reopen the claim was filed.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r).  An effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the earliest medical evidence showing a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA.  Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999).

The effective date for an award of an increased rating (including an inferred TDIU) will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If the increase is factually ascertainable within one year prior to the receipt of the claim for an increased rating, the rating will be effective as of the date of increase; however, if the increase occurred more than one year prior to the receipt of the claim, the increase will be effective on the date of the claim.  In addition, if the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date will be the date of increase.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1), (2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998).

For purposes of effective date rules, the mere filing of a claim for service connection does not carry with it an implied filing for a TDIU.  A claim for an increased rating has to be pending in order to warrant the application of Rice.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009) (holding that a request for a TDIU, whether expressly raised by a Veteran or reasonably raised by the record, is not a separate "claim" for benefits, but rather, can be part of a claim for increased compensation).  A TDIU claim constitutes a type of increased rating claim for effective date purposes.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 32-34 (2007).  Generally, under 38 C.F.R. 3.400(o), the earliest effective date of an award of an increased rating may be up to one year prior to the filing of a formal claim, but no sooner than entitlement is shown.  Applying 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), TDIU may be effective up to one year before the date of the receipt of the claim if evidence indicates that the Veteran became unemployable due to service-connected disabilities at some point during that year.  If the Veteran became unemployable more than one year prior to the date of the claim, then the effective date will be the date the TDIU claim was received.  Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.  When a Veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the Veteran prevails.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board notes that the AOJ granted TDIU based on the Veteran's service-connected heart and mental health disabilities.  See June 2022 rating decision.  This rating decision provided an effective date of January 4, 2021 based on the receipt of an intent to file and the submission of the November 2021 TDIU application.  The May 2023 rating decision also included the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus as a basis for TDIU.  See May 2023 rating decision.

By way of history, the Veteran filed an intent to file form which was received by VA on January 4, 2021.  In November 2021, the Veteran filed an application for TDIU.  See November 2021 VA Form 21-8940 and November 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.  No TDIU application is of record prior to this date.  The AOJ made two requests to the Veteran to submit a VA Form 21-4192 from the Veteran's most recent employer.  See November 2021 Subsequent Development Letter and January 2022 Initial Private 3rd Party Letter 21-4192.  No VA Form 21-4192 was submitted into the record.  This TDIU claim was granted in the June 2022 rating decision.  The June 2022 rating decision found that the Veteran became schedularly eligible for TDIU as of February 21, 2017.  The Board will treat this as a binding favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

Turning to the Veteran and his attorney's contention, the Board cannot agree that the Veteran's heart and mental health claims warrant an inferred claim for TDIU since February 21, 2017.

Prior to the November 2021 TDIU claim, the Veteran filed several claims in February 2017, March 2018, and March 2019.  See February 2017, March 2018, and March 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ.  There were no supplemental claims filed during this period until February 2023 in which the Veteran contested the effective date of his award of TDIU.  None of these claims addressed that the claimed conditions contained therein caused the Veteran to be unable to work.  Additionally, there are no personal statements of record from the Veteran that he was unable to work specifically due to these conditions.

The Board notes that as part of the Veteran's claim for TDIU in November 2021, the Veteran claimed his service-connected heart and mental health disabilities prevented his ability to work.  The Veteran further noted that he had last worked fulltime as a driver for UPS.  The Veteran reported that his heart and mental health disability began to affect his employment in October 2006.  He reported that he worked for UPS from October 1976 to October 2007.  He further reported that he did not retire from UPS due to the listed disabilities, has not attempted to obtain employment since leaving UPS, has some college education but has not had any training or education since becoming too disabled to work, and has not tried to obtain employment since leaving UPS.  See November 2021 VA Form 21-8940.

The Veteran was provided with several pertinent medical examinations for his service-connected disabilities prior to the assigned January 4, 2021 effective date for TDIU.

A March 2017 VA mental health examination noted occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  The Veteran did not report an inability to work to the examiner but did report retiring from UPS after 32 years and not working in any capacity since.  No indication of total occupational impairment was provided by the examiner.  See March 2017 VA mental health examination.

An April 2018 VA heart examination indicated a diagnosis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease since 2016.  This condition required continuous medication for treatment, but the Veteran did not have a myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmia.  The examiner reported that the Veteran's fatigue and shortness of breath due to his cardiac condition would impact his ability to work.  However, the examiner did not indicate nor did the Veteran report that his condition would prevent substantial gainful employment.  This determination was made despite the Veteran being noted to be between 5-7 METS due to dyspnea and fatigue and despite an exercise stress test needing to be terminated due to the symptoms related to his cardiac condition.  See April 2018 VA heart examination.

A June 2018 VA mental health examination noted occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency.  The Veteran reported having worked at UPS but that he had to retire on disability due to a back injury.  The Veteran reported not having worked since retiring from UPS and not participating in volunteer work.  Neither the examiner nor the Veteran reported that the Veteran could not work due to the severity of this disability.  No indication of total occupational impairment was provided by the examiner.  See June 2018 VA mental health examination.

The Veteran was again provided with a VA heart examination in April 2019 which noted a diagnosis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and mitral valve regurgitation.  The Veteran was found to have a METS of 3-5 due to dyspnea and fatigue but found a METS level of 5-7 based solely on the cardiac condition.  The examiner noted that based on the symptoms, the Veteran should avoid prolonged walking, frequent climbing, running, and moderate to heavy lifting, pushing, and pulling.  Again, the examiner did not indicate nor did the Veteran report that these symptoms prevent the ability to maintain substantial gainful employment.  See April 2019 VA heart examination.

There are no other applicable VA or private examinations of record prior to the assigned effective date of January 4, 2021.

Prior to the May 2023 rating decision, the Veteran, through his attorney, submitted a vocational assessment.  See February 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.  The private vocational provider indicated that, based on her training and experience, the Veteran has been unable to maintain substantially gainful employment at any exertional level since March 16, 2017.  As rationale, the provider indicated that the Veteran was able to maintain employment for a considerable period of time until his symptoms became progressively worse.  The provider indicated that his difficulty interacting with others would be beyond employer tolerance, and that his inability to maintain his appearance would impact his ability to work.  Further, the Veteran's limitations regarding prolonged walking and pushing and pulling would restrict his exertional ability to the sedentary exertional level, but that even sedentary jobs would be problematic as the extra time necessary to complete tasks would prevent performance at a consistent pace.  The provider also noted numerous medical appointments and VA examinations indicating limitations and symptoms based on those medical notes.  Finally, the provider appears to note in section VI that the Veteran's UPS employment was not considered as it was beyond a 15-year window.  This determination was based on a 2001 and 2007 study noted in section VII that indicates that it is no longer realistic to expect skills to continue after 15 years.

The Board finds this February 2023 vocational assessment of low probative value.  First, the vocational provider indicates that the Veteran left his UPS position because his symptoms became worse.  Id. at 13.  However, the provider does not address what symptoms became worse or whether they were due to a service-connected disability.  For example, the June 2018 VA mental health examination indicated, based on the Veteran's report, that the Veteran retired from UPS due to a back injury.  However, the Veteran has not been service-connected for a back condition.  Additionally, the provider did not discuss that indication within the TDIU application that the Veteran did not leave his job at UPS due to heart or mental health conditions or that he has not tried to obtain employment since his retirement from UPS.  Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 (1993) (medical opinion based on inaccurate factual premise may properly be rejected as non-probative); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 293 (2012) (an adequate examination "must rest on correct facts and reasoned medical judgment so as inform ... and facilitate the Board's consideration and weighing of the report against any contrary reports").  

Second, the providers determination is based on conclusory determinations.  The provider does not define what levels of exertion are required for substantially gainful employment, the provider does not define "sedentary exertional level," and does not indicate the basis for employer tolerance of documented disabilities.  Withers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 139 (2018) (If an exam says the Veteran is capable of "sedentary" employment, must state what the term "sedentary" means and then consider whether s/he is capable of sedentary work based on education, job history, etc.).  Third, and of some significance, the provider has not pointed to any lay statements by the Veteran or any other lay statements of record, that the Veteran is incapable of substantially gainful employment during the period from February 21, 2017 to January 4, 2021.  The provider does not address any specific medical record or lay statement where the Veteran reports an inability to work due to the service-connected conditions.  Nor does the provider address whether the Veteran actually has a desire to rejoin the workforce.  Pederson v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 276, 286-87 (2015) (en banc) (recognizing that the burden is on the claimant to establish entitlement to a total disability evaluation based on individual unemployability) (emphasizing that the appellant had not pointed to any evidence demonstrating that his level of education and employment history categorically precluded him from sedentary employment).  

Fourth, the provider explicitly did not address the Veteran's work history and how those skills may or may not have an impact on his ability to function in an employment environment.  The provider merely relied on a medical study from 2001 and 2007 to remove those skills from consideration without providing a basis for doing so.  Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60 (2018) (must provide a rationale that relates to a Veteran's "particular medical condition and circumstances").  Finally, the provider notes, as part of the justification for the findings, that a July 2017 medical note indicates that the Veteran cannot work in his yard and cannot take out the trash without needing a break.  However, the provider does not address the Veteran's later contention, within the same medical record, that he is not working in the yard or going on walks in the forest preserve due to very hot weather.  See July 2017 and September 2017 medical notes within March 2018 CAPRI record.

As the vocational assessment was based on partially inaccurate information regarding the Veteran's retirement from UPS, did not consider the Veteran's work history, did not address the Veteran's indication in the TDIU claim that he had not looked for work since retiring from UPS, did not define exertional levels of employment or sedentary employment, did not address either the lay statements of record or lack of lay statements of record regarding employability, and did not address the entire medical picture of the Veteran when providing the assessment, the Board must find this vocational assessment of little probative value.

Based on the above and following a review of the entire record, the Board finds that the issue of TDIU was not reasonably raised by the record prior to the Veteran's filing of the January 4, 2021 intent to file and the November 2021 TDIU application.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009).

As noted in the September 2018 notification letter, the AOJ's September 2018 rating decision, which granted an increased rating for the Veteran's heart disability from 10 percent to 30 percent, did not find an inferred claim for TDIU.  See September 2018 Notification Letter.  Additionally, the April 2017 rating decision which granted service connection for the mental health disability did not find an inferred claim for TDIU based on either the claim itself or the development which followed.  Further, none of the Veteran's claims, as noted above, indicated that the Veteran was unable to work due to those claimed conditions nor were any personal statement submitted indicating that the Veteran was unable to work.

The Veteran and his attorney have also contended, in the November 2021 TDIU application, that his heart and mental health disabilities began to affect his full-time employment.  They indicate that these disabilities began to affect his employment in October 2006 but that he did not stop working until October 2007.  See November 2021 VA Form 21-8940.  However, neither the Veteran nor his attorney have provided a basis for this contention.  They point to no specific medical or employment reason as to why the Veteran was no longer able to work at UPS due to these now service-connected disabilities.  See June 2018 VA mental health examination.

Additionally, no VA Form 21-4192 from the Veteran's most recent employer was submitted by either the Veteran or his attorney in connection with this claim.  Therefore, no workplace concessions or accommodations could be noted in the record nor have either the Veteran and his attorney contented that concessions or accommodations based on the service-connected disabilities were provided.  No additional reasoning for the Veteran leaving his position was provided within the record.  Further, the record appears clear that the Veteran never attempted to regain employment following his retirement from UPS.  See June 2018 VA mental health examination; see also November 2021 VA Form 21-8940

The Board finds the argument provided by the Veteran and his attorney that TDIU was reasonably raised prior to the January 4, 2021 intent to file a claim and the November 2021 TDIU application is unsupported by the record.  Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (a claimant bears the evidentiary burden to establish entitlement to the benefit sought); see also Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995) (VA is not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed).  The evidence of record persuasively does not provide a basis to infer a TDIU claim prior to the January 4, 2021 intent to file a claim and the November 2021 TDIU application.  While the Veteran may have met the criteria for TDIU as of February 21, 2017 as indicated by the June 2022 rating decision, there was no claim of TDIU, either express or implied, prior to the November 2021 TDIU application.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009).

The Board finds as a binding favorable finding that the January 4, 2017 intent to file a claim is connected to the November 2021 TDIU application.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104; see June 2022 rating decision.  The Board will not disturb this determination as it results in maximized benefits for the Veteran.  Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162, 167 (2019).

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's assertions and grateful for his service, but the Board is bound and constrained by law, and its decision is dictated by the relevant statutes and regulations.  Moreover, the Board is without authority to grant benefits simply because it might perceive such a grant to be equitable.  38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104; Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994).  "[N]o equities, no matter how compelling, can create a right to payment out of the United States Treasury that has not been provided for by Congress."  Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992).

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for an earlier effective date for TDIU prior to January 4, 2021.  As such, the claim is denied, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided.  This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
