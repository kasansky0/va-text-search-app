FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had right ear hearing loss at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the current left ear hearing loss began during active service or is otherwise causally related to an in-service injury or disease.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had sleep apnea at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had depression, alcohol abuse, and memory loss at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for right ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. The criteria for service connection for left ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385. 

3. The criteria for service connection for sleep apnea are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for service connection for depression, to include alcohol abuse and memory loss, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from February 2000 to October 2004. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). See October 2023 rating decision.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. In order to prevail on the issue of service connection there must be competent evidence of a current disability; medical evidence, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and competent evidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran was offered a VA Compensation and Pension (C&P) examination in October 2023. See October 2023 C&P Exam. Audiometric testing was conducted and the Veteran's Puretone thresholds in decibels were reported as follows: 

			HERTZ		

	500 	1000 	2000 	3000 	4000 

RIGHT 	35dB	30dB	25dB	25dB	15dB

The Veteran's speech discrimination score using the Maryland CNC word list was a 100 percent for the right ear. 

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing is considered a disability when (1) the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater, or (2) when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater, or (3) when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels, and higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 160 (1993).

The Veteran does not meet the VA's definition of hearing loss for the right ear as (1) the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz are not 40 decibels or greater, nor is (2) the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz 26 decibels or greater, nor is (3) the right ear speech recognition scores less than 94 percent.

Accordingly, there is no diagnosis of right ear hearing loss under the VA's definition of hearing loss. The Board finds that the evidence weights against a finding of service connection and the Veteran's claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran's audiometric testing results for the left ear were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500 	1000 	2000 	3000 	4000 

LEFT 	40dB	25dB	20dB	20dB	20dB

The Veteran's speech discrimination score using the Maryland CNC word list was a 100 percent for the left ear. See October 2023 C&P Exam.

The Veteran meets the diagnostic criteria for left ear hearing loss under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. As such, a current disability has been shown. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

The evidence does not show an event, disease or injury in service. 38 C.F.R. 3.303, 38 C.F.R. 3.304. The Veteran's Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) was IT Information Systems Technician which carries a low to moderate probability of hazardous noise exposure. See Certificate of Discharge From Active Duty (e.g. DD 214). Service treatment records do not contain complaints, treatment, or a diagnosis for hearing loss. See STR - Medical. 

The Veteran reported noise exposure in service during "ship maintenance using pneumatic equipment and chippers." The Veteran reported experiencing noises such as "banging metal and chipping paint off. Guns going off... being in a fan room where the exhaust from the turbines comes out. It was loud. Standard firearm straining." The Veteran reported not using any ear protection. 

The October 2023 C&P examiner found that it is less likely than not that left ear hearing loss is related to military noise exposure. In support of this opinion the examiner noted there was no evidence of a significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds between the entrance and separation audiological examinations. The examiner provided the following rationale: 

Hearing was documented to be normal at separation from the military in 2004 with no STS since enlistment. As a rule, noise-induced hearing loss begins during or shortly after a prolonged period of noise toxicity. It is not known to lie dormant. It has now been nearly twenty years since separation from the military, and loss has developed over that two-decade period. Additionally, noise-induced hearing loss should manifest at 2kHz and above; veteran presents today with low frequency hearing loss instead. Therefore, it is less likely than not that the hearing loss is a result of noise exposure sustained while in the military.

There is no evidence that the examiner was either not competent or credible. Further, the examiner specifically considered the Veteran's reports of in-service noise exposure and addressed them in the opinion. As such, the Board finds that the opinion is entitled to significant probative weight as to the presence of a nexus. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).

Concerning the lay evidence of record, the Veteran has generally asserted that his hearing loss is due to service. However, he is not competent to provide an opinion linking his hearing loss to service as to do so requires medical knowledge and training beyond that which may be expected of a lay person. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011). Therefore, the assertions of a direct causal relationship are entitled to no probative weight. The Veteran has not asserted that his hearing loss has been continuous since service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

The Veteran denied any current or history of hearing loss at separation. There are no other treatment records associated with the file indicating that the current hearing loss is causally related to the Veteran's noise exposure in service. 

Based on the foregoing, the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's hearing loss is causally related to service. As noted above the VA examiner's opinion is entitled to significant probative weight as it considered the Veteran's reports of noise exposure in service, discussed the relevant audiometric findings of record, and provided a well-reasoned rationale. The Veteran also denied any issue with hearing loss at separation. There is no record of hearing loss following separation up to now. As the evidence weights persuasively against a finding of a nexus, service connection for left ear hearing loss is not warranted on a direct basis. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.	

The Board notes that sensorineural hearing loss is considered an organic disease of the nervous system and therefore is a chronic disease for VA purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). However, there is no evidence of manifestation of hearing loss to a compensable degree within the first post-service year. The Veteran's hearing on the left was within normal limits at separation and the Veteran denied any issues with hearing loss at separation. There is no other evidence of treatment within the one year following separation. As such, service connection on a presumptive basis is not warranted in this case. Id.

For the above reasons, the evidence persuasively weighs against entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss. As the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). For these reasons, the claim is denied.

3. Service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

4. Service connection for depression, to include alcohol abuse and memory loss, is denied.

The Veteran applied for service connection for sleep apnea, depression, alcohol abuse and memory loss in August 2023. See August 2023 fully developed claim. The AOJ, in an October 2023 rating decision, denied service connection for sleep apnea, finding no diagnosis, denied service connection for depression, alcohol abuse, and memory loss finding no diagnosis.

There are only 22 documents in the Veteran's claim file. The Veteran has not provided any documentation of a current diagnosis for any of the above listed disabilities. To the extent the Veteran believes he has a current diagnosis of a sleep apnea or depression, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case as to do so requires medical knowledge and training beyond that which may be expected of a lay person. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).

A review of the Veteran's service treatment military personnel records does not show an in-service event, injury or disease that may have caused the sleep apnea, depression, alcohol abuse, or memory loss. See STR - Medical.

In general, no compensation shall be paid for a disability that is a result of the Veteran's own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110 (emphasis added). This includes conditions resulting, or secondary, to the alcohol abuse. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36 (1994). A limited exception from this 38 U.S.C. § 1110 willful misconduct "bar" was carved out by the Federal Circuit in its precedential decision in Allen v. Principi, 237 F.3d 1368 (2001). Therein, the Federal Circuit held that a veteran was not precluded from receiving compensation for alcohol or drug-related disabilities arising secondarily from a service-connected disability, or from using alcohol or drug-related disabilities as evidence of the increased severity of a service-connected disability. In other words, compensation may be awarded only "where there is clear medical evidence establishing that alcohol or drug abuse is caused by a veteran's primary service-connected disability, and where the alcohol or drug abuse disability is not due to willful wrongdoing." Allen, 237 F. 3d at 1381. Thus, the pertinent inquiry is whether there is "clear evidence" that shows the alcoholism is caused by a service-connected disability and, if so, the alcohol abuse is not due to willful wrongdoing.

There is no diagnosis of sleep apnea or depression of record. The Board therefore finds there is not an approximate balance of evidence favoring the claim, and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply. The claims therefore must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

REASONS FOR REMAND 

1. Service connection for back condition is remanded.

2. Service connection for left knee joint pain is remanded.

3. Service connection for right knee joint pain is remanded.

The AOJ did not obtain a medical opinion prior to the rating decision on appeal. The VA's duty to assist includes obtaining a medical examination or opinion when such is necessary to decide on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). An examination or medical opinion is necessary if the evidence of record (1) contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability, or persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability; and (2) establishes that the claimant suffered an event, injury, or disease in service; or has a presumptive disease or symptoms of such a disease manifesting during an applicable presumptive period; and (3) indicates that the claimed disability or symptoms may be associated with the established event, injury, or disease in service; but (4) does not contain sufficient medical evidence for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

The Veteran served in the Navy from February 2000 to October 2004 including service in Korea. He earned eight awards and commendations for his service. The Veteran was awarded the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and Korea Defense Service Medal. 

In the August 2023 fully developed claim the Veteran reported developing joint pain in service by "walking up and down stairs while underway causing added stress on joints' and "mandatory running while having knee problems." 

The Veteran reported developing back pain in service due to his "uncomfortable bed, forced PT, lifting/moving heavy objects." Id. The Veteran reported working on the ship and doing "ship maintenance using pneumatic equipment and chippers... It was just banging metal and chipping paint off. My whole first year was spent cleaning..." 

Although there is no diagnosis on record for the Veteran's back condition or knee pain, if the Veteran's condition manifests in symptoms that cause functional impairment, they may be consider a "disability." 

As the Veteran expressed the existence of persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability and reported that he suffered an event, injury, or disease in service an examination should have been provided to the Veteran to explore the nature and etiology of his current conditions. 

The RO did not provide the Veteran with any VA examination. This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Accordingly, the matters are REMANDED for the following actions: 

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for his back and bilateral knee condition. The examiner must review the claims file.

If a diagnosis cannot be provided but the Veteran's condition manifests in symptoms that cause functional impairment, then the examiner should consider them a "disability" for the purpose of providing the requested opinion(s) below.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Is the Veteran's back condition at least as likely as not related to service? 

Is the Veteran's left and right knee condition at least as likely as not related to service? 

In providing the requested opinion, consider the Veteran's description of the in-service injury and symptoms as well as post-service symptoms. If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported injury and symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of the current disability, this should be noted. Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about the symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for his or her opinion(s) in the examination report. If any of the above requested opinions cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner must state this and provide a rationale for such conclusion. In so doing, the reviewing clinician must explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information, or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that question.
