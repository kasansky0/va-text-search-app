CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to July 20, 2022, for the award of service connection for headaches have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for migraines have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1975 to October 1979 and from August 1991 to April 1992.

In a November 2015 Board decision, entitlement to service connection for headaches was denied.  In July 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application for headaches.  In a September 2022 rating decision, the previous denial of service connection for headaches was confirmed and continued.  In December 2022, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.  In a March 2023 rating decision, a duty to assist error was identified during the Higher-Level Review for the claimed headaches disability.  In an October 2023 rating decision, service connection for migraines was granted, with an evaluation of 30 percent, effective July 20, 2022.  In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review of the October 2023 decision with respect to the assigned rating, which the AOJ denied in March 2024.  The Veteran then filed VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182), in March 2024, contesting the effective date of the grant of service connection and the assigned rating and requested direct review of his claim.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision which was subject to higher level review in the March 2024 higher level review decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that the Veteran had claimed entitlement to a TDIU as part and parcel of the claim for a higher rating for headaches.  See November 2023 VA Form 21-4138.  However, entitlement to a TDIU was separately granted in a May 2024 rating decision, effective May 31, 2022, the date in which the schedular criteria had been met.  Entitlement to a TDIU has been granted in full, and the Veteran has not indicated that he disagrees with any issue that resulted from the May 2024 rating decision, including the effective date.  The May 2024 award of a TDIU constituted a full grant of the benefit sought, and entitlement to a TDIU need not be addressed further.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 20, 2022 for the grant of service connection for migraines is denied.

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than July 20, 2022 for the award of service connection for migraines.  The Veteran asserts that he has continuously pursued his claim since March 7, 2019.  See July 2024 Appellate Brief.

Generally, the effective date for an award of service connection is the day after service separation or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if the claim is received within one year of the date of separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b).  Where a claim for service connection is reopened and granted based upon new and relevant evidence, other than service records, received after the prior rating decision has become final, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim to reopen or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (r).

For supplemental claims received more than one year after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issues notice of a rating decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(2).

Generally, a claimant may indicate a desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b).  However, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 clarifies that the intent to file provision set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b) does not apply to supplemental claims.

As noted above, the claim for service connection for headaches was previously denied in a November 2015 Board decision.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision and it is final.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (b), 7252; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.

Thereafter, on March 8, 2019, VA received the Veteran's Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for headaches.

In a letter dated April 29, 2019, VA informed the Veteran that the March 2019 VA Form 21-526 EZ was an improper form, that VA regulations require the claim to be filed on the proper form, and that no further action would be taken until the proper form was received.  Subsequently, the Veteran filed a November 2019 VA Form 20-0995 and an October 2020 VA Form 20-0996.

In a letter dated November 3, 2020, VA informed the Veteran that his request for further review of his VA Form 20-0996, Higher Level Decision Review Request was unable to be processed.  The Veteran was notified that his supplemental application was received on November 13, [2019] on a VA Form 20-0995 and no claim was established due to him not submitting any new and relevant evidence in Block 14.  The Veteran was informed that for his application for Higher Level Review to be processed, he must be appealing a claim already on file within 12 months of a decision's date.  As this was not the case, the Veteran's VA Form 20-0996 was not processed.  It was recommended that the Veteran provide a VA Form 20-0995 with new and relevant information for his appeal to be processed through the Supplemental Claim review process.  The Veteran was reminded that he was sent a notice on November 26, 2019 in response to his VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application explaining the incomplete nature of his application.  Thereafter, the Veteran's Supplemental Claim Application was not complete until July 20, 2022, the date of receipt of the VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim and a July 2022 private examination.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160.

In September 2022, the AOJ reopened the Veteran's headache claim, finding that new and relevant evidence had been submitted, and denied the service connection claim.  In December 2022, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.  In a March 2023 rating decision, a duty to assist error was identified during the Higher-Level Review for the claimed headaches disability.  In the October 2023 rating decision, service connection for migraines was granted, with an evaluation of 30 percent, effective July 20, 2022.  In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review of the October 2023 decision with respect to the assigned rating, which the AOJ denied in March 2024.  The Veteran then filed VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182), in March 2024, contesting the effective date of the grant and the assigned rating and requested direct review of his claim.

Given the foregoing evidence, the Board finds that entitlement to an effective date prior to July 20, 2022, for the grant of service connection for migraines is not warranted.  The November 2015 Board decision denying service connection for headaches is final.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156.  VA regulations specifically state that that the exception provided to the effective date rules, allowing for the submission of an Intent to File a Claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b), does not apply to Supplemental Claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  A complete Supplemental Claim Application was not received until July 20, 2022.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160.  Accordingly, an effective date prior to July 20, 2022, for the award of service connection for migraines is not warranted.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for migraines is denied.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of a service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, the Board must also consider staged ratings, which are appropriate when the evidence establishes that the claimed disability manifested symptoms that would warrant different ratings for distinct time periods during the appeal.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided; however, separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994); 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

The Veteran is competent to give evidence of symptoms observable by his senses, and the Board finds him credible as his statements are detailed and consistent.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Veteran's service-connected migraines have been evaluated as 30 percent disabling pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

Under DC 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for less frequent attacks.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018).  This renders 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation.  Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The rating criteria for a 50 percent rating contain several undefined phrases.  The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253.  The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraines attack must render the veteran entirely powerless.  Id.  The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract."  Id. (internal citation omitted).  Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability."  "Productive" can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445-46 (2004).

In July 2022, the Veteran submitted a private examination.  It was noted that the Veteran experienced pulsating or throbbing head pain, pain on both sides of the head, and pain that worsened with physical activity.  He also experienced non-headache symptoms associated with headaches, to include nausea, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, and difficulty concentration.  Typical head pain lasted 1 to 2 days and was on both sides of the head.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain 3 to 4 times per week.  He also indicated that he had very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain productive of severe economic adaptability.  The examiner noted the Veteran's headache condition impacted his ability to work.

During a December 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported worsening headaches after returning from Desert Storm in 1992.  He began having intermittent headaches while he was stationed in Kuwait.  His headaches were intermittent, 2 to 4 times a month, lasting hours to several days, with complete resolution.  He described pain as 7 to 8 out of 10 in intensity, throbbing, sharp pain, typically beginning in the forehead with radiation bilaterally.  He reported aura, photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea.  He denied emesis or sensory changes.  Physical activity made the headaches worse.  He noted that the headaches gave him a lot of anxiety that interfered with his sleep.  The examiner noted symptoms of pulsating or throbbing head pain, pain localized to one side of the head, pain on both sides of the head, and pain that worsened with physical activity.  The Veteran experienced non-headache symptoms associated with headaches, including nausea, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, and changes in vision.  Typical head pain lasted 1 to 2 days and typical head pain was on both sides of the head.  The examiner noted the Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain once every month.  He also had completely prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain once every month.  The examiner noted the Veteran's report that his headache condition caused him to miss 8 to 10 days of work a month.  His headaches impacted his ability to perform physical activities and required him to rest for extended periods.  His headaches sometimes prevented him from sleeping for days.  The examiner additionally remarked that the Veteran reported sometimes he would not be able to sleep for 2 to 3 days, and he just felt utterly exhausted.  He noted that his headache pain felt like his lobes were separating.  Sometimes the headache was one sided and sometimes bilateral.  He reported needing to wear sunglasses inside due to significant photophobia and noted that bright lights could trigger headaches.  Loud noises could also trigger migraines.  Without medication his migraines could reach above a 10 in intensity.  Aura was described as "little stars or flashing lights".  Rest, a dark room and medication helped his headaches.

After careful review, the Board finds that when considering the impact of the Veteran's migraines, the evidence fairly reflects that his overall headache pattern was productive of characteristic prostrating attacks occurring at least once a month on average, as is reflected by the VA examination reports and the remaining evidence of record.  Although the July 2022 VA private examiner indicated the Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain 3 to 4 times per week, the December 2022 VA examiner noted the Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain once every month.  The Board finds the objective medical evidence and the findings listed in the December 2022 VA examination report to be more probative in evaluating the severity of the Veteran's disability and assigning an evaluation in accordance with the rating criteria for migraines.  The December 2022 VA examination report was more in-depth regarding the Veteran's migraine symptoms and noted review of the Veteran's claims file.  Additionally, the VA examiner took a complete history from the Veteran.  On the other hand, in providing the scant report, the July 2022 private examiner did not review the Veteran's medical records or obtain a history from the Veteran.  Consequently, the Board assigns more probative weight to the VA examination report.  The Board further agrees with VA's determination that the Veteran's symptoms more nearly approximated the criteria for a 30 percent rating under DC 8100.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100.

A rating in excess of 30 percent were not met.  The VA examination reports of record note that the Veteran's headache condition impacted his ability to work.  The December 2022 VA examiner specifically noted that it caused him to miss 8 to 10 days of work a month and impacted his ability to perform physical activities, requiring him to rest for extended periods.  However, the December 2022 VA examiner did not indicate that the Veteran experienced very prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Although the July 2022 private examiner noted the Veteran experienced very prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability, the examiner did not provide any details regarding the impact of the Veteran's headache condition on his ability to work.  There is no indication in the record of a history of attacks resulting in total powerlessness or severe economic inadaptability, as defined by the Court.  The Board reiterates that the Veteran has been granted entitlement to a TDIU in a May 2024 rating decision, effective May 31, 2022.  In granting a TDIU, it has nonetheless been found that, due in part to the functional impact of his migraines, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation throughout the appeal period.

The Veteran has not put forth sufficient evidence to warrant a rating in excess of 30 percent.  The Board acknowledges his lay statements but finds nothing in them suggests that the specific criteria for a 50 percent rating were met.

The law mandates that a 50 percent rating is only warranted with evidence of very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Id.  These criteria were explicitly assessed and denied by the VA examiner.  The Veteran has not challenged the results of the VA examination, and the Board essentially adopts the findings therein - which are most consistent with a 30 percent rating under DC 8100 - for the entire appeal period.  There is no indication that the VA examination was inadequate.

Accordingly, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted at any point during the appeal period.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the record).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
