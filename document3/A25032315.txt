ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities from September 2, 2023, but no earlier, is granted, subject to the laws and regulations controlling the award of monetary benefits.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation from September 2, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a TDIU are met from September 2, 2023.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1971 to November 1974.

This matter comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that, among other things, denied entitlement to a TDIU.  The Board is bound by the favorable finding?in the decision that the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The Veteran timely appealed the May 2024 rating decision in an August 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) (VA Form 10182) and?selected?direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).? 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(b)(1).  Accordingly, the Board will review the evidence of record as of the date of the May 2024 rating decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board will not consider evidence added to the record after the dates of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  If evidence was added during any ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and?the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.? 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2)(B);?38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). 

The Board notes that the Veteran indicated in his August 2024 VA Form 10182 that he was appealing July 11, 2024 and July 31, 2024 decisions that denied entitlement to a TDIU.  However, given that neither of those July 2024 decisions denied entitlement to a TDIU, the Board finds that the Veteran timely appealed the May 2024 rating decision that denied entitlement to a TDIU as that is the most recent decision denying that claim.  See VA Claims and Appeals Modernization, 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 152 (Jan. 18, 2019) ("§?20.202 notes that '[t]he Board will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal.' This language protects the rights of a veteran who, for example, incorrectly identifies the date of the agency of original jurisdiction decision, but does provide enough information that VA is able to identify the issue and decision on appeal).

The Veteran's attorney submitted a Privacy Act request in October 2018 that has yet to be fulfilled by the VA.  However, given that the Board is granting the benefit sought in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with adjudication of the claim.

As a final preliminary matter, the Board generally may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting a docket switch under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) has elapsed.? Williams?v.?McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024). ?38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows claimants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new NOD within one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives an NOD, whichever is later, unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony.? In this case, although the deadline for requesting a docket switch has not elapsed here, there is no prejudice in proceeding with adjudication of the claim as the benefit sought is being granted in full.?? 

Entitlement to a TDIU

VA will grant a TDIU when the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of his service-connected disabilities, from securing and following "substantially gainful employment" consistent with his education and occupational experience.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  The central inquiry is, "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability."  Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).  The Board must evaluate whether there are circumstances in a veteran's case, apart from any non-service-connected condition and advancing age, which would justify a total rating based on individual unemployability due solely to the service-connected conditions.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The regulations provide that if there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more, and if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability must bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Veteran submitted his formal TDIU application in January 2024.  He is currently in receipt of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy rated at 40 percent from November 24, 2015; left lower extremity radiculopathy rated at 40 percent from November 24, 2015; thoracolumbar degenerative joint disease (DJD) rated at 40 percent from September 9, 2020; respiratory disability rated at 10 percent from October 8, 2013; tinnitus rated at 10 percent from February 11, 2016; and noncompensable left ear hearing loss.  Thus, the Veteran's combined schedular rating is 90 percent from September 9, 2020.  He therefore meets the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) for the entire appeal period.

The relevant question is then whether the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities preclude gainful employment for which his education and occupational experience may otherwise qualify him.

The term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" is defined as having two components: one economic and one non-economic.  The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  The non-economic component includes consideration of the veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).

For the following reasons, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded gainful employment for which his education and occupational experience might have otherwise qualified him.

In his January 2024 formal TDIU application, the Veteran indicated that his service-connected back and radiculopathy disabilities prevented him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation.  He additionally noted that he graduated from high school and owned a trucking and flatbed company from April 1994 to September 1, 2023.  The Veteran left his self-employment because of his disabilities and did not have any other education and training before or since he became too disabled to work.

In a January 2024 statement, the Veteran reported that he was unable to lift or pull tarps over products to be delivered on his flatbed trucks.  He could also no longer throw straps over shipments without straining his back and could barely bend over to pick equipment off of the ground that was to be stored on the back of a trailer.

During a February 2024 VA peripheral nerves examination, the Veteran indicated that he experienced constant, sharp, shooting pain in his legs and numbness that would come and go.  His knees and ankles were hypoactive with decreased sensation testing for light touch in the right and left lower leg/ankle and foot/toes.  The VA examiner found that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities impacted his ability to work in that he was unable to stand or walk for long periods of time due to pain.

During a February 2024 VA back examination, the Veteran endorsed lower back pain that shot into both of his legs.  He also indicated that he was unable to get back up if he got down, and the pain and numbness in his legs was constant.  There was functional loss or functional impairment of an inability to lift anything or stand for long periods of time.  The VA examiner found that the Veteran's back disability impacted his ability to work in that he was unable to lift anything or stand for long periods of time.

In an April 2024 statement, the Veteran noted that he could not sit, stand, walk, pull, push, or lift because of his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.  He also indicated that he could not perform sedentary work as he could not sit for any period of time without moving, had no "desk work" skills, and became sleepy from the medicine he took for his disabilities.  

Thus, the above evidence of record reflects that the Veteran last worked in September 2023 as a truck/flatbed driver at his own company.  Overall, he experienced symptoms associated with his service-connected disabilities that resulted in functional impairments that would significantly interfere with his ability to secure and follow any substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience.

Specifically, the evidence of record reflects symptoms and impairments associated with his service-connected disabilities (including, but not limited to, severe and constant back and bilateral lower extremity pain and numbness, and an inability to sit, stand, walk, pull, push, throw, or lift) that would prevent him from performing any type of substantially gainful employment (physical or non-physical) consistent with his education and occupational experience.  

Further, given the Veteran's background as a truck driver, the type of job for which the Veteran is qualified is one that involves both sedentary and physical activity, skills that his back and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities have significantly impaired.  Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013) ("applicable regulations place responsibility for the ultimate TDIU determination on the VA, not a medical examiner.").  Thus, entitlement to a TDIU due to the Veteran's service-connected disabilities is warranted from September 2, 2023, the day after his last day of full-time employment, with no evidence or argument that his employment was in a protected environment.  Labruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet App. 111, 123-24 (2024) (defining "employment in a protected environment" as "a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market").
