DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

An effective date prior to August 22, 2019, for the award of additional Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits for D., the Veteran's spouse is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On August 6, 2019, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted service connection for major depressive disorder and assigned a 30 percent rating for that disability, effective April 13, 2017. 

2. In her August 22, 2019, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, VA Form 21-686c, the Veteran failed to provide the date and the place of her marriage to D., information required to establish the marriage.   

3. In her April 4, 2023, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, VA Form 21-686c, the Veteran provided information sufficient to establish her September 2005 marriage to D.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to August 22, 2019, for the award of additional disability compensation for the Veteran's dependent spouse have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(f); 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 2002 to October 2003.  She had additional duty with the Army Reserve. 

In April 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted additional VA compensation benefits for D., the Veteran's spouse, and effectuated the award as of April 4, 2023.  In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, VA Form 20-0996.  In May 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction assigned an effective date of August 22, 2019 for the award of additional VA compensation benefits.  In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date

The Veteran contends that an effective date of April 13, 2017, is warranted for the award of additional dependent benefits for her spouse, D., as she provided evidence of dependency within one year of notification of the August 2019 rating decision that established a 30 percent service-connected rating.  

A veteran whose disability is rated not less than 30 percent, shall be entitled to additional compensation for dependents.  38 U.S.C. § 1115.  An effective date of the award of any benefit or any increase therein by reason of marriage shall be the date of such event if proof of such event is received by the Secretary within one year from the date of the marriage, birth, or adoption.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(n); 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).  Otherwise, the effective date is the date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within one year of the VA request.  38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).  The payment of monetary benefits based on an award or an increased award of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, may not be made to an individual for any period before the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the award or increased award became effective.  The term "award or increased award" means an original or reopened award or an award that is increased because of an added dependent, increase in disability or disability rating, or reduction in income.  38 U.S.C. § 5111(a), (d).

On August 6, 2019, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted service connection for major depressive disorder and assigned a 30 percent rating for that disability, effective April 13, 2017.  The August 2019 award notification informed the Veteran that she should submit information as to her dependents. 

In her August 2019 Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, VA Form 21-686c, the Veteran reported that she was married to D., and had two minor children.  While she provided information as to the birthdates and the birthplaces of her two children, the Veteran did not provide information as to either the date or the place of her reported marriage to D.  

In August 2019, VA awarded additional VA compensation benefits to the Veteran on behalf of her two minor children, effective as of May 1, 2017.  In its August 22, 2019, written notice to the Veteran of the award, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction informed the Veteran that: "[w]e are paying you as a Veteran with 2 dependent(s);" "[y]our payment includes an additional amount for your children;" and "[w]e made this decision because your reported dependents meet the criteria for establishing a relationship and you are in receipt of at least 30% service-connected disability benefits."  While she was informed of her appellate rights, the Veteran was not informed of the additional information to establish D., as her spouse for VA disability compensation purposes.  She did not submit any disagreement with the August 2019 award.  

In her April 4, 2023, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, VA Form 21-686c, the Veteran informed VA that she was married to D., and provided the date and the place of the marriage.  

In April 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted additional VA disability compensation on behalf of D., effective as of April 4, 2023.  In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, VA Form 20 0996.  In May 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction assigned an effective date of August 22, 2019 for the award of additional VA compensation benefits as the August 22, 2019, award notice failed to inform the Veteran of the additional evidence needed to add D. to her award.  

In August 2019, the Veteran was awarded a qualifying 30 percent rating for her service-connected disability, effective April 13, 2017.  On April 4, 2023, the Veteran submitted the evidence necessary to establish her marriage to D.  Therefore, the appropriate effective date for the award of additional compensation benefits for the Veteran's dependent spouse is April 4, 2023, the date that sufficient 

 

evidence to establish the Veteran's marriage to D., was received by VA.  Therefore, the Board finds that an effective date prior to August 22, 2019, for the award of additional compensation benefits for D., is not warranted.
