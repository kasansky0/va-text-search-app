FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A September 2021 rating decision denied service connection for right foot plantar and achilles calcaneal enthesophytes, degenerative arthritis, and foot pain; evidence submitted since the September 2021 rating decision is new and relevant as it pertains to the Veteran's claim for service connection for a right foot disability.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had a headache disorder, to include migraines, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had erectile dysfunction at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

4. The evidence persuasively reflects the Veteran's diabetes was not shown as chronic in service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; the disability is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

5. The evidence persuasively reflects the Veteran's gout was not shown as chronic in service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; the disability is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

6. The Veteran has continuously pursued the evaluation of his right knee claim since his initial claim for right knee disability on December 31, 2020, and the likelihood is at least approximately balanced that the Veteran had right knee instability as of that date.

7. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that Veteran had right knee scars prior to September 29, 2021, rather, the evidence of record reflects such scars were as a result of surgery on September 29, 2021, specifically a right knee arthroscopy with partial medial meniscectomy, right knee arthroscopy with chondroplasty, and right knee arthroscopy with limited synovectomy.  

8. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that Veteran had right knee surgery prior to September 29, 2021 necessitating at least one month of convalescence, rather, the evidence of record reflects on September 29, 2021 he had a right knee arthroscopy with partial medial meniscectomy, right knee arthroscopy with chondroplasty, and right knee arthroscopy with limited synovectomy.

9. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding Veteran's scars of the right knee measure an area of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1992 to February 1995.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) thanks the Veteran for his service to our country.

In January 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested review of a September 2021 rating decision as to service connection for hypertension and a right foot disability based on new and relevant evidence.  In September 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received as to each claim and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the September 2022 decision as to the denials to reopen service connection for hypertension and a right foot disability.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal as to these claims, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 rating decision and again denied the claims to reopen service connection for hypertension and a right foot disability.

In January 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested review of a June 2021 rating decision as to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus based on new and relevant evidence.  In September 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received as to each claim and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the September 2022 decision as to the denials of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal as to these claims, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 rating decision and again denied the claims.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2022 rating decision as to the denial of service connection for peripheral arterial disease, claimed as blood clots of the lower right extremity associated with the right knee.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal as to this claim, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 rating decision

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2022 rating decision as to the denial of service connection for a headache disorder, erectile dysfunction, diabetes, gout, a heart disability, and a back disability, an earlier effective date for the award of a separate rating for instability of the right knee, an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for scars of the right knee, an earlier effective date for the assignment of a temporary total evaluation for right knee strain, post arthroscopic procedure, with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, limitation of extension, due to a period of convalescence, and increased initial ratings for instability of the right knee, and scars of the right knee.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal as to these claims, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 rating decision.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2022 rating decision as to increased initial ratings for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, and also attempted to appeal effective dates assigned for the grant of service connection for these disabilities.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal as to the claims for increased initial ratings for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 rating decision, but which did not address the claims for earlier effective dates for the grant of service connection for these disabilities.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a November 2022 rating decision as to the denials of service connection for a right hip disability and a left hip disability.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal as to these claims, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 rating decision.

In the June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the respective AOJ decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the applicable decision as to the respective claim, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims of entitlement to service connection for a headache disorder, to include migraines, erectile dysfunction, diabetes, and gout, an earlier effective date for the award of a separate rating for instability of the right knee, and an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for scars of the right knee, entitlement to earlier effective date for the assignment of a temporary total evaluation for right knee strain, post arthroscopic procedure, with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, limitation of extension, due to a period of convalescence, and entitlement to an initial compensable rating for scars, right knee, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, a heart disability, a right hip disability, a left hip disability, peripheral arterial disease, a back disability, hearing loss and tinnitus, entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee instability, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, and entitlement to a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

As a final preliminary matter, under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins (PACT) Act of 2022, VA is required to provide an examination and medical opinion addressing potential toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) when the Veteran submits a claim for compensation, has evidence of a disability, has evidence of participation in a TERA, and such evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a).  Here, in January 2024, VA issued a Memorandum, which conceded the Veteran had participation in TERAs, which is a legal finding and for Board consideration.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1119.  

However, in this case, pursuant to the AMA review system, Board remand is only warranted to correct a duty-to-assist error committed by the AOJ which occurred prior to the respective AOJ decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  In this case, the only AOJ decisions at issue, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review, and which do not predate the August 10, 2022 passage of the PACT Act, were the September 2022 and November 2022 decisions.  Thus, the PACT Act only potentially applies to the September 2022 and November 2022 decisions.  However, the claimed right foot disability, right hip disability, and left hip disability, are disabilities which have been related to an injury, indicating physical trauma.  Thus, an exception to the TERA opinion requirement applies, and the Board need not further address these claims on this basis.  However, the TERA opinion requirement applies to the claims for bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus and hypertension.  Further, as the hypertension claim is affected by the TERA requirements, new and relevant evidence is not necessary to warrant readjudication on the merits due to the liberalizing law.  The issue has appropriately been recharacterized above and the Board may proceed to consideration of the merits of that claim.

NEW AND RELEVANT EVIDENCE

Under the AMA, in order to readjudicate a previously disallowed claim, new and relevant evidence must be received.

VA regulations provide that a claimant who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim any time after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending or has become finally adjudicated.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.  If new and relevant evidence is not presented or secured, the AOJ will issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim.  In determining whether new and relevant evidence is presented or secured, VA will consider any VA treatment records reasonably identified by the claimant and any evidence received by VA after VA issued notice of a decision on the claim and while the evidentiary record was closed.  Id.

The new and relevant standard will not impose a higher evidentiary threshold than the previous new and material evidence standard under § 3.156(a).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.  Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).  For VA to readjudicate the claim, the evidentiary record must include new and relevant evidence that was not of record as of the date of notice of the prior decision.  Upon receipt of a substantially complete supplemental claim, VA's duty to assist in the gathering of evidence under § 3.159 of this part is triggered and includes any such assistance that may help secure new and relevant evidence as defined in paragraph (a) of 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 to complete the supplemental claim application.  Id.

New and relevant evidence received before VA issues its decision on a supplemental claim will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(2).

1. Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for a right foot disability

The Veteran contends that he has submitted new and relevant evidence that warrants readjudication of the issue of service connection for a right foot disability. The Board agrees.

The Veteran's claim to reopen service connection for right foot disability, was received via a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, by VA on January 10, 2022, which was within one year of an intent to file claim, received by VA on October 26, 2021, as evidenced by a notice letter of the same date.  Thus, the appeal period is from October 26, 2021, the date of the intent to file claim, to September 19, 2022, date the AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, was issued.  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to this claim was that claimed primary disability of left knee strain with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear was service-connected and the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability, as an August 2021 VA examiner endorsed diagnoses of right foot plantar and Achilles calcaneal enthesophytes.  Also, a July 2021 VA examiner endorsed diagnoses of plantar fasciitis, and plantar and Achilles calcaneal enthesophytes and the August 2021 VA examiner also endorsed a diagnosis of degenerative arthritis.

A September 2021 rating decision denied an original claim for service connection for right foot plantar and achilles calcaneal enthesophytes, degenerative arthritis, and foot pain.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the September 2021 rating decision as to this claim was that claimed primary disability of left knee strain with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear was service-connected and the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability, as an August 2021 VA examiner endorsed diagnoses of right foot plantar and Achilles calcaneal enthesophytes.  The September 2021 rating decision found the evidence did not show that right foot plantar and achilles calcaneal enthesophytes, degenerative arthritis, foot pain, were related to the service-connected condition of left knee strain with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, limitation of extension and flexion, nor was there any evidence of this disability during military service.  The evidence of record at that time included service treatment records, private treatment records, VA treatment records, and July 2021 and August 2021 VA examination reports.  Also, in his June 2021 original application, the Veteran argued his right foot disability was secondary to his service connected left knee disability, and as to weight bearing on both knees, he had to alternate weight from one side to another side. 

Evidence submitted since the September 2021 rating decision, issued on September 10, 2021, and prior to the September 19, 2022, the date the AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, was issued, includes VA treatment records, private treatment records and an April 2022 right foot VA examination report, which does not reflect any additional right foot complaints, symptoms or diagnoses.  Indeed, the April 2022 VA examination report did not endorse any diagnoses as to the Veteran's right foot.  Further, the April 2022 VA examination report did not document any symptomology or findings related to the Veteran's right foot. Thus, the April 2022 VA examination tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue, current disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The Board also recognizes in the March 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the Veteran's representative also argued that a VA examination was warranted for the Veteran's right foot condition to determine if it was related to his service-connected left foot condition, and argued an April 2022 VA examination report found the Veteran limped due to his left foot, and a July 2021 VA examination report found the Veteran's left foot condition resulted in inference with standing, disturbance of locomotion, swelling and a lack of endurance.  However, without evidence or argument prior to the September 2022 rating decision, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review, that the Veteran's right foot disability was secondary to his service-connected left foot disability, including as due to limping or other functional impairment, the Board cannot find a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand on this basis.  

As the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been presented with respect to the Veteran's claim for service connection for a right foot disability, readjudication is warranted.

SERVICE CONNECTION

Generally, service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

To establish service connection on a direct incurrence basis, the Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The requirement for a current disability is satisfied if the disability is present at any point proximate to the claim, during the claim, or to the appeal period.  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  If there is no evidence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Additionally, there must be a demonstration of symptoms proximate to, or since, the time the application is filed.  Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 1998).

In addition, for Veterans with 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic diseases, to include diabetes mellitus, and gout as a form of arthritis, may be presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifest to a compensable degree within a certain timeframe from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Furthermore, certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a headache disorder, to include migraines

2. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction

The Veteran contends service connection for a headache disorder and erectile dysfunction are warranted.

The Veteran's claims for service connection for a headache disorder and erectile dysfunction, were received by VA via an application for benefits on February 10, 2022.  Thus, the appeal period is from February 10, 2022, the date of claim, to April 12, 2022, date the AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, was issued.  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to the claim for service connection for a headache disorder was that the Veteran had sufficient service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection, as he served in the from February 1992 to February 1995.  As to the claim for service connection erectile dysfunction, the April 2023 rating decision did not provide any favorable findings.  

Under any theory of entitlement, the threshold question for the Board for each claim is whether the Veteran has had a headache disorder, to include migraines, or erectile dysfunction, at any time during or approximate to the pendency the claims.  In this regard, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a headache disorder, to include migraines, or erectile dysfunction, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of these claims.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. at 294; McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321.

As to the claim for a headache disorder, to include migraines, proximate to and during the appeal period, the Veteran's VA treatment records do not reflect the existence of headaches and/or migraines, or chronic complaints thereof, but rather do document many other complaints, and also reflect he routinely denied headaches.  For example, proximate to the appeal period, February 2021 and April 2021 VA treatment records documented the Veteran had no headaches.  A June 2021 VA treatment documented the Veteran denied headache, while another June 2021 VA treatment record documented the Veteran was asking for a referral to cardiologist at the VA for a second opinion.  Also, during the appeal period, a January 2022 VA treatment record documented the Veteran was negative for, and he denied certain symptoms, including headaches and migraines.  Another January 2022 VA treatment record documented the Veteran had no headache but that he complained of left hip pain for two weeks.  A February 2022 VA treatment record documented the Veteran had a right partial meniscectomy, that he was currently working in a position where he has to stand all day and after about four hours his knees hurt and burned, but other than his knees, he was doing well.  An April 2022 VA treatment record documented the Veteran presented asking for an opinion and guidance over treatment for his knees.

Similarly, the proximate to and during the appeal period, the Veteran's private treatment records do not reflect the existence of headaches and/or migraines, or chronic complaints thereof, but rather do document many other complaints, and also reflect he routinely denied headaches.  For example, proximate to the appeal period, October 2020, November 2020, December 2020 and April 2021 private medical records documented the Veteran had no complaints of headaches.  A May 2021 private treatment record documented the Veteran was negative for headaches and that he denied headaches.  Also, during the appeal period, August 2021 and February 2022 private treatment records documented the Veteran had no complaints of headaches, and provided assessments of thrombocytosis and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.  The February 2022 private treatment record also documented the Veteran's problem list, of unresolved problems, consisted of insomnia, chest pain, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, acute kidney injury, left foot pain, grief, tinnitus of both ears, hearing difficulty of the left ear, right knee pain, gout, dyslipidemia, musculoskeletal back pain, chronic pain of both knees, low back pain, prediabetes, thrombocytosis, primary hypertension, tobacco use, a body mass index of 35.0 - 35.9, and chronic right shoulder pain.

As to the claim for erectile dysfunction, proximate to and during the appeal period, the Veteran's VA treatment records do not reflect the existence of erectile dysfunction, or chronic complaints thereof, but rather do document many other complaints.  For example, proximate to the appeal period, a June 2021 VA treatment record documented the Veteran reported he was trying to find out why he turned to alcohol every time he was angry, irritated, and/or stressed.  Also, during the appeal period, a July 2021 VA treatment record documented the Veteran reported constant ringing in the left ear for at least two months.  A December 2021 VA treatment record documented the Veteran's chief complaint was mixed hearing loss and incomplete ear clearance.  A January 2022 VA treatment documented the Veteran complained of left hip pain for two weeks.  A March 2022 VA treatment record documented the Veteran complained of bilateral knee pain, chronic back pain, neck pain, and noted his blood pressure was mildly elevated.

Similarly, the proximate to and during the appeal period, the Veteran's private treatment records do not reflect the existence of erectile dysfunction, or chronic complaints thereof, but rather do document many other complaints.  For example, proximate to the appeal period, a June 2021 private treatment record documented the Veteran was seen for a right knee follow-up.  Another June 2021 private medical record documented the Veteran reported a three-week history of left foot pain after falling into a hole while carrying groceries.  A subsequent June 2021 private treatment record documented the Veteran had a follow-up visit for left foot pain.

Also, during the appeal period, September 2021 and October 2021 private treatment records documented the Veteran was seen for a right knee follow-up.  Another September 2021 private treatment record documented the Veteran reported, as to his right knee, pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion.  A November 2021 private treatment record documented the Veteran's right knee symptomology.  Another November 2021 private treatment record provided assessments of insomnia, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.  A February 2022 private treatment record provided assessments of thrombocytosis, right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, and status post right knee surgery.

Thus, despite consistent treatment proximate to appeal period, the Veteran's VA treatment records and private treatment records do not contain a diagnosis of a headache disorder, to include migraines, and/or erectile dysfunction, or chronic complaints thereof, but rather reflect other diagnosis and complaints.

The Board finds that if the Veteran had experienced symptoms related to his headache disorder, to include migraines, and/or erectile dysfunction, proximate to and during the current appeal period, it would have been reasonable for him to have reported it, given that he sought treatment for various other medical conditions.  Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011) (where there is a lack of notation of medical condition or symptoms where such notation would normally be expected, the Board may consider this as evidence that the condition or symptoms did not exist).

Thus, the evidence of record does not show a diagnosis of a headache disorder, to include migraines, and/or erectile dysfunction, or any potentially existing symptoms, resulted in functional impairment of earning capacity with respect to either claim, nor has the Veteran argued such.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Indeed, the Veteran has not asserted he experienced any symptoms such as head pain or sexual dysfunction, nor are any such symptoms chronically documented in the evidence of record proximate to and during the appeal period.  Given the competent medical evidence, proximate to and during the appeal period, does not reflect a diagnosis or recurrent or persistent symptoms of a disability, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against finding a diagnosis or recurrent or persistent symptoms of a disability as to a headache disorder, to include migraines, and/or erectile dysfunction.

While the Veteran is competent to report readily observable findings, as discussed, he has not reported any current symptoms.  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, none of the circumstances outlined in Jandreau are applicable here.  The Veteran has not been shown to be competent to provide a diagnosis a headache disorder, to include migraines, and/or erectile dysfunction.  The issue of providing a diagnosis of a headache disorder, to include migraines, and/or erectile dysfunction, is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education.  

Further, while VA has not provided a medical examination to the Veteran for his claims for a headache disorder, to include migraines, and erectile dysfunction, the standard for VA to provide an examination for these claims was not satisfied.  In this instance, as discussed above, only evidence of the existence of disability is the Veteran's bare assertion of such disability in terms of filing these claims.  The record available to the Board's review does not contain competent evidence of diagnosed disability or symptoms of disability for a headache disorder, to include migraines, and/or erectile dysfunction or any indication of nexus to service for either claim.  Indeed, the Veteran has not described any related symptomology nor is such otherwise reflect in record as to either claim.  Thus, a VA examination or a medical opinion for these claims are not warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-82 (2006).

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claims.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for a headache disorder, to include migraines, and service connection for erectile dysfunction, are not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

3. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes 

4. Entitlement to service connection for gout 

The Veteran's claims for service connection for diabetes, and gout, were received via an application, by VA on February 10, 2022.  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to the Veteran's claims for diabetes and gout, were that the Veteran had sufficient service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection and that he had been diagnosed with disabilities as VA treatment records revealed diagnoses of diabetes and gout.

Thus, the question for the Board is whether the Veteran's diabetes and/or gout are related to service.  However, Veteran has not explicitly asserted that his diabetes and/or gout onset during service, manifested to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period, manifested with continuity of symptomatology, or are related to his service on a direct incurrence basis.  In this regard, review of the Veteran's service treatment records does not reflect any documentation of diabetes, gout, or chronic complaints thereof. 

The Board finds that if the Veteran had experienced diabetes and/or gout during his active service, it would have been reasonable for him to have reported it as his service treatment records show he did seek treatment for a number of other complaints.  For example, a January 1992 service treatment record documented the Veteran complained of difficulty seeing for one day.  March 1992 service treatment records documented the Veteran reported neck pain.  May 1992 and June 1992 service treatment records documented the Veteran reported bilateral knee pain.  An August 1992 service treatment record documented the Veteran reported nausea.  An October 1992 service treatment record documented the Veteran reported back pain for one week.  A November 1992 service treatment record documented the Veteran reported left knee pain for 24 hours.  A January 1993 service treatment record documented the Veteran reported a sore throat.  Another January 1993 service treatment record documented the Veteran reported nausea and vomiting.  A November 1993 service treatment record documented the Veteran complaint of nausea for one day.  An October 1994 service treatment record documented the Veteran reported low back pain for three days.

However, the Veteran's service treatment records, including his August 1994 separation examination report, do not reflect the existence of diabetes, and/or gout related complaints, treatment or a diagnosis.  See Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011) (where there is a lack of notation of medical condition or symptoms where such notation would normally be expected, the Board may consider this as evidence that the condition or symptoms did not exist).  Further, an August 1994 Report of Medical History, documented the Veteran denied, as relevant to diabetes, sugar or albumin in urine, and denied, as relevant to gout, swollen or painful joints. 

Moreover, the clinical evidence also shows the Veteran was not diagnosed with diabetes or gout until many years after separation from service.  In this regard, as to diabetes, an August 2021 VA treatment record documented the Veteran's A1C was elevated to 6.5 and he was not on diabetes mellitus medication, and a February 2022 VA treatment record documented a laboratory finding showed an HgA1C of 6.5, and provided a new diabetic diagnosis, and that the Veteran interested in discussing dietary changes to control this.  Also, as to gout, a March 2020 VA treatment record documented, as to the Veteran's left foot, gout was suspected.  Also, another March 2020 VA treatment record documented the Veteran was recently seen in the emergency department for left foot pain, that he was told he probably had gout, and had done well since then, that he "never had this happen before" and he "did get online and researched which foods to avoid and self care." 

While not dispositive, the passage of years between discharge from active duty service in February 1995, and the initial demonstration of diagnoses diabetes and gout many years later, is a factor that weighs against a finding of service incurrence.  Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Indeed, the evidence of record does not reflect the existence of diabetes or gout until many years after separation from service.  For example, as to diabetes, prior to February 2022, April 2008, December 2008, and December 2009 VA treatment records documented the Veteran was negative for diabetes mellitus.  Also, a May 2008 VA treatment record documented the Veteran did not have diabetes.  An October 2013 VA treatment record documented the Veteran had no known history of diabetes mellitus.  A July 2014 VA treatment record documented the Veteran had no known history of diabetes mellitus.  A January 2020 VA treatment record documented the Veteran denied a past medical history of diabetes.  March 2020 and July 2021 VA treatment records documented the Veteran had no history of diabetes.

Also, as to gout, while the Veteran's medical records do document specific disabilities other than gout, his medical records, prior to March 2020, do not reflect chronic symptoms related to gout.  For example, a January 2008 VA treatment record documented as to the Veteran's musculoskeletal system, and specifically as to his extremities, he had normal joints, radial and pedal pulsations, and no edema, varicosities, cyanosis, and deformity or trauma.  A September 2017 VA treatment record documented, as to the Veteran's musculoskeletal system, he had no muscle pain, or injury, and no joint pain, or swelling.  Similarly, a November 2019 VA treatment record documented as to the Veteran's musculoskeletal system, he denied backache, joint pain, stiffness, pain or swelling in extremities.

While the AOJ did not obtain VA medical opinions addressing these claims, the duty to assist did not require VA to obtain such medical opinions prior to the rating decision on appeal.  In this instance, the evidence does not indicate that gout and/or diabetes are related to service. Thus, although the AOJ did not obtain VA medical opinions no pre-decisional duty to assist error exists such that remand for a VA medical opinion addressing this claim on these bases is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i); McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 81-82.

While the Veteran may believe his diabetes and gout are related to service, he has not been shown to have the requisite medical knowledge and expertise to be deemed competent to make this determination.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence discussed above.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claims.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for diabetes, and service connection for gout, are not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

EFFECTIVE DATES

Generally, service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  

Generally, the effective date for an award of compensation or claim for increase is the date of receipt of the claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The date of entitlement is the date the claimant meets the basic eligibility criteria for the benefit.  Additionally, 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a) provides that "[a] specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary ... must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual."  The general rule with respect to effective date of an award of increased compensation is that the effective date of award "shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application thereof."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

Additionally, VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  The amendments, however, are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Under the old regulations, any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA, from a claimant or the claimant's representative, may be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (in effect prior to March 24, 2015).

Under the old regulations, the Board also recognizes a veteran's claim was required to identify the sickness, disease, or injuries for which compensation was sought with at least at a high level of generality.  Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  Additionally, the identification of a claim could have been made indirectly through examination of evidence to which the claim documents themselves pointed to when sympathetically read.  Shea v. Wilkie, 926 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  Specifically, an informal claim may have been raised by language that pointed to records mentioning a condition in a way that, sympathetically read, was properly understood as seeking benefits for such a condition.  Id. at 1370.  Hence, where a claimant's filings referred to specific medical records, and those records contained a reasonably ascertainable diagnosis of a disability, the claimant had raised an informal claim for that disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  Id.

Additionally, a temporary total disability rating will be assigned, effective from the date of a hospital admission and continuing for a period of one, two, or three months from the first day of the month following such hospital discharge, if the hospital treatment of a service-connected disability resulted in: (1) surgery necessitating at least one month of convalescence, (2) surgery with respect to postoperative residuals such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps and recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, or the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches (regular weight-bearing prohibited), or (3) immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.30(a).

Convalescence is the stage of recovery following an attack of disease, a surgical operation, or an injury.  The word "recovery" means the act of regaining or returning toward a normal or healthy state.  Felden v. West, 11 Vet. App. 427, 430 (1998) (internal quotations and reference citations omitted).

The effective date of a temporary total rating assigned under 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 is governed by the regulation concerning the effective date for increased ratings. For increased ratings, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if the claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  The period on appeal cannot date back to more than one year prior to the date of claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b).

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 5, 2022 for the grant of a separate rating for instability of the right knee

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to April 5, 2022 for the grant of a separate rating for instability of the right knee.  In the March 2023 VA Form 0996, the Veteran argued he was entitled to an "effective date no later than 12/31/2020 for his right knee limitation of extension, which is the date VA received his Intent to File."  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to this claim, was that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability, as a treatment report dated April 5, 2022 showed a diagnosis of instability of the right knee.

The Veteran argues his right knee instability stems from his application for benefits, received by VA on March 13, 2021, which included a claim for a right knee disability, and which was within a year of an intent to file claim, received by VA on December 31, 2020. The Board agrees.

The Veteran's initial claim was adjudicated in a June 2021 rating decision.  As discussed above, the June 2021 rating decision granted service connection for a right knee strain with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, and provided separate ratings for limitation of extension and limitation of flexion. In January 2022, within a year of the June 2021 rating decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim as to "Rating Evaluation & Effective Date (RE&ED) - Right Knee Condition" and expressed disagreement with the June 2021 rating decision. 

The AOJ instead inferred a claim for a separate rating for right knee instability with an application for a temporary total evaluation for right knee strain received by VA on September 30, 2021, which was within one year of an intent to file claim received by VA on September 10, 2021, as noted in the April 2022 rating decision. While the AOJ has not taken action on the January 2022 Supplemental Claim, finding the January 2022 Supplemental Claim which identifies a higher rating for the right knee as an issue (instead of the September 2021 filing which only addressed a temporary total rating) is valid results in a finding that the Veteran has continuously pursued this claim since the original December 31, 2020 filing. This reading of the evidence is more favorable to the Veteran, and given that it provides the him earliest possible effective date (and the date sought by the Veteran), there is no prejudice in doing so.

[In contrast, the claims for the Veteran's service-connected left knee and left foot, remanded below, cannot be fully adjudicated at this time].

The April 2022 rating decision granted service connection for right knee instability effective April 5, 2022, stating this was the date the evidence showed right knee instability due to the service connected right knee condition.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the April 2022 rating decision as to an earlier effective date for the award of a separate rating for instability of the right knee.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal as to this claim, which again found April 5, 2022 was the date the evidence showed right knee instability due to the service-connected right knee condition.

However, there is evidence of right knee instability prior to April 5, 2022.  Indeed, an earlier June 2021 rating decision granted service connection for a right knee strain with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, and provided separate ratings for limitation of extension and limitation of flexion.  Further, a June 2021 VA examiner documented the Veteran reported or had a history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the knee, specifically that he had instability in the knee while walking over uneven surfaces.  Also, a July 2021 VA examiner documented the Veteran reported he now used a right knee brace.  Additionally, a November 2021 private medical record documented the Veteran reported the most recent exacerbation to his right knee occurred while working, specifically that when he was working in October 2020, he took a step when carrying a heavy object on his shoulders and felt something different in his knee, and he could not bear weight due to pain suddenly.

Thus, after resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal the Veteran had right knee instability, at least as of December 31, 2020, the date of the intent to file claim-the first request for compensation for a right knee disability.  Thus, the effective date is the later of the date of claim or the date the disability arose, thus, December 31, 2020 is the earliest possible effective date for the right knee instability.

For the reasons and bases discussed above, the Board concludes that an effective date of December 31, 2020, but no earlier, is warranted.  As such, the Board finds that, with resolution of doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence supports the Veteran's claim for an effective date of December 31, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of a separate rating for right knee instability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 29, 2021, for the grant of service connection for scars, right knee

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to September 29, 2021 for the grant of service connection for scars of the right knee.  The Veteran has not provided any argument as a specific effective date which is sought. 

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to this claim, was that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability, as a review of his outpatient treatment records from Dr. Michael Dersam revealed that he underwent a right knee scope with partial meniscectomy chondroplasty and limited synovectomy on September 29, 2021.

By way of procedural background, the Veteran's inferred claim for service connection for right knee scars, was received by VA on September 30, 2021, via an application for a temporary total evaluation for right knee strain, post arthroscopic procedure, with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, which was within one year of an intent to file claim, received by VA on September 10, 2021, as evidenced by a confirmation letter of the same date.  

Thereafter, an April 2022 rating decision granted service connection for right knee scars effective September 29, 2021, stating this was the date the evidence the Veteran underwent surgery for his service-connected right knee condition.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the April 2022 rating decision as to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for scars of the right knee.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal this claim.

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that Veteran had right knee scars prior to September 29, 2021, but rather reflects such scars were as a result of surgery on September 29, 2021.  Specifically, on September 29, 2021, a private operative medical record documented the Veteran underwent a right knee arthroscopy with partial medial meniscectomy, right knee arthroscopy with chondroplasty, and right knee arthroscopy with limited synovectomy.  Also, prior to September 29, 2021, there is no evidence the Veteran had a scar of his right knee related to his service-connected right knee disabilities.  In this regard, June 2021 and July 2021 VA examiners found the Veteran did not have any scars or other disfigurement (of the skin) related to any conditions or to the treatment of any conditions listed in the diagnosis section as to his right knee disabilities.  Likewise, evidence of right knee scars related to the Veteran's service-connected right knee disabilities is not of record prior to September 29, 2021.

As discussed above, the effective date is the later of the date of claim or the date the disability arose, thus, as the Veteran's right knee scars arose due to surgery on September 29, 2021, this is the proper effective date.

Thus, for the reasons and bases discussed above, the Board finds entitlement to service connection for right knee scars did not arise prior to September 29, 2021 and concludes that an effective date prior to September 29, 2021 is not warranted.  As the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application and the appeal is denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 29, 2021 for the temporary total evaluation assigned for right knee strain, post arthroscopic procedure, with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, limitation of extension, due to a period of convalescence 

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to September 29, 2021 for the temporary total evaluation assigned for right knee strain, post arthroscopic procedure, with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, limitation of extension, due to a period of convalescence.  In the March 2023 VA Form 0996, the Veteran argued he was entitled to an "effective date no later than 06/30/2021 for his temporary 100% evaluation, which the date VA received his Intent to File."  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to this claim, was that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability, as treatment records from Dr. Dersam showed he underwent a right knee scope with partial meniscectomy chondroplasty and limited synovectomy on September 29, 2021.

By way of procedural background, the Veteran's claim for a temporary total evaluation assigned for right knee strain, post arthroscopic procedure, with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, was received, by VA on September 30, 2021, via an application for benefits, which was within one year of an intent to file claim, received by VA on September 10, 2021, as evidenced by a confirmation letter of the same date.  

Thereafter, an April 2022 rating decision granted a temporary total evaluation for right knee strain, post arthroscopic procedure, with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, limitation of extension, due to a period of convalescence pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.30.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the April 2022 rating decision as to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for scars of the right knee.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal this claim.

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that Veteran had right knee surgery prior to September 29, 2021, but rather reflects he underwent right knee surgery on September 29, 2021.  Specifically, on September 29, 2021, a private operative medical record documented the Veteran underwent a right knee arthroscopy with partial medial meniscectomy, right knee arthroscopy with chondroplasty, and right knee arthroscopy with limited synovectomy.  Also, prior to September 29, 2021, there is no probative evidence the Veteran had right knee surgery necessitating at least one month of convalescence related to his service-connected right knee disabilities.  In this regard, some evidence, to include a February 2022 VA treatment record, and a March 2022 VA examination report, noted the Veteran had right knee surgery, partial meniscectomy, in October 2020.  However, there are no medical records of a right knee partial meniscectomy, in October 2020.  Further, an April 2022 VA examiner documented the Veteran had right knee surgery in 2021.  Likewise, other medical and lay evidence does not persuasively reflect the Veteran had right knee surgery necessitating at least one month of convalescence related to his service-connected right knee disabilities prior to September 29, 2021.  For example, in September 2021 statement, the Veteran stated "I am requesting 100% temporary disability for my scheduled arthroscopic knee surgery on Sept 29 -2021."  October 2020 and November 2020 private medical records also documented the Veteran reported he needed right knee surgery.  A May 2021 private medical record documented the Veteran had had no recent immobilization or surgery.  A June 2021 private medical record documented as to the Veteran's assessment of right knee pain, medial meniscus tear, he would benefit from an arthroscopic procedure.  

As discussed above, the effective date is the later of the date of claim or the date the disability arose, thus, as the Veteran's right knee scars arose due to surgery on September 29, 2021, this is the proper effective date.

Thus, for the reasons and bases discussed above, the Board finds entitlement to service connection for right knee scars did not arise prior to September 29, 2021 and concludes that an effective date prior to September 29, 2021 is not warranted.  As the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application and the appeal is denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

INCREASED RATING

Generally, service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

VA must consider whether to "stage" the rating, meaning assign different ratings at different times during the rating period to compensate the Veteran for times when the disability may have been more severe than at others.  Consideration of the appropriateness of a staged rating is required for increased rating claims, irrespective of whether it is an initial rating at issue or instead an established rating.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2008).

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for scars, right knee

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for scars of the right knee.  The Veteran has not provided any argument as to why an initial compensable rating is warranted. 

The appeal period is from September 29, 2021, the date service connection was awarded for scars of the right knee, to April 12, 2022, date the AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, was issued.

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The April 2023 rating decision did not provide any favorable findings as to the claim for an initial compensable rating for scars of the right knee.

Through the initial appeal period, the Veteran's right knee scars are rated under Diagnostic Code 7802.

The Board notes that VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018.  These amended regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the AOJ on or after August 13, 2018.  Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied.  The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.  Here, as the appeal period is from September 29, 2021, only the new regulations for application.

Since August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Under these criteria, a scar with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater warrants a 10 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of an initial compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the Veteran's right knee scars did not manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  Specifically, the March 2022 VA examination report documented the Veteran had an arthroscopic incision, round, times three, of the anterior knee, right lateral knee and right medial knee, with an approximate total area of 75 cm2.  Another March 2022 VA examination report found the Veteran's scar, due to an arthroscopic incision of the right knee, was in three locations, which measured .5 cm. by .5 cm.  The April 2022 VA examination report found the Veteran had a scar of measuring 1 by 1 cm., and another scar measuring 1 by .2 cm.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars. However, the Veteran's right knee scars, are not of the head, face, or neck, are not deep and non-linear, and are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  Moreover, the Veteran's right knee scars are not unstable or painful.  Specifically, the March 2022 and April 2022 VA examination reports documented the Veteran's right knee scars were not painful or unstable, with frequent loss of covering of skin over the scars, were without underlying soft tissue damage, and were not located on the head, face or neck.  Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, and 7804, from August 13, 2018, are inapplicable.

Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated under post-August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7805.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes, by virtue of filing an appeal, that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned initial disability rating reflects.  However, while the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, he has not reported or described any symptomology related to his right knee scars at issue here.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  

Additionally, neither the Veteran nor her representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record with respect to his right knee scars.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

Thus, for the reasons and bases discussed above, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for an initial compensable rating for scars of the right knee.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an initial compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the appeal is denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

The Veteran's claim to reopen service connection for hypertension, was received via a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, by VA on January 10, 2022, which was within one year of an intent to file claim, received by VA on October 26, 2021, as evidenced by a notice letter of the same date.  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to this claim was that Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability, as the medical records from Valleywise Health showed a diagnosis of hypertension.  

First, the Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exist as to this claim, specifically that the AOJ erred insofar as it did not attempt to obtain potentially relevant private treatment records.  Specifically, in a July 2021 statement, the Veteran reported he was hospitalized, he believed 2002 or 2003, for high blood pressure at St. Luke's Hospital in Tempe, Arizona.  Thus, failure of the AOJ to request the necessary authorization from the Veteran to obtain private treatment records from St. Luke's Hospital in Tempe, Arizona, for treatment for hypertension and/or high blood pressure, in 2002 or 2003, is a pre-decisional duty to assist error and a remand is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these records.  The Veteran may also provide these records himself to VA.

Second, the Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exist as to this claim, specifically that the AOJ errored insofar as the evidence at the time of the September 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, was sufficient to trigger VA's duty to assist in obtaining a supplemental opinion addressing the claim on the basis of participation in TERAs.  Specifically, in January 2024, VA issued a Memorandum which found the Veteran's military occupational specialist (MOS) of avenger crewman (missile system) and collateral duties of an ammunition handler had a high probability of exposure to solvents, rocket and diesel fuel, oils, and lubricants and also that there was high probability of exposure to toxic material used in ammunition as such depleted uranium, phosphorus/phosphates gunpowder residue.  Because the Board is unable to grant this claim at this time, and because the requirements to obtain a medical opinion compliant with 38 U.S.C. § 1168 were met prior to the September 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, but such opinion was not obtained, this is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  Thus, remand is warranted for a supplemental opinion that considers the Veteran's TERAs.

The Board also recognizes in the March 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the Veteran's representative also argued that an addendum opinion was warranted for to determine whether the Veteran's hypertension related to chronic pain caused by service-connected conditions and cites to a March 31, 2022 VA treatment record for the proposition that the Veteran blood pressure is elevated when experiencing chronic pain.  However, review of the March 31, 2022 VA treatment record separately documented the Veteran reported a chief complaint of back pain (and a back disability is not service-connected), that he also reported bilateral knee pain and neck pain (a neck disability is not service-connected) and that his blood pressure was mildly elevated, but there was no indication of a link between the bilateral knee pain and the mildly elevated blood pressure.  Indeed, another VA treatment record of the same date noted the Veteran had a limited ability to exercise but was encouraged to increase physical activity as much as possible since any increase in activity may be beneficial in improving blood pressure control.  Thus, without competent and credible evidence prior to the September 2022 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, indicating that the Veteran's hypertension was secondary to his service-connected disabilities due to chronic pain, the Board cannot find a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand on this basis.  

2. Entitlement to service connection for a heart disability is remanded.

The Veteran's claim for service connection for a heart disability, was received via an application, by VA on February 10, 2022.  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to this claim was that the Veteran had sufficient service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection, as he served from February 1992 to February 1995, and he had been diagnosed with a disability, as VA treatment records revealed a diagnosis of hypertensive heart failure.

First, the Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exist as to this claim, and as to the claim, remanded below, for peripheral arterial disease, specifically that the AOJ erred insofar as it did not attempt to obtain potentially relevant private treatment records for thrombocytosis, which is a condition characterized by an abnormally high number of platelets in the blood, and can increase the risk of abnormal clotting, leading to complications like heart attack, and/or deep vein thrombosis.  Specifically, October 2020, November 2020, December 2020, April 2021 and February 2022 private treatment records documented the Veteran stated that he was seen by another hematologist at Maricopa Hospital for evaluation of thrombocytosis.  Also, an October 2019 VA treatment record documented the Veteran recently saw an oncologist, Dr. Waqas Arslan, for a new diagnosis of thrombocytosis.  A June 2020 VA treatment record referenced treatment at the Maricopa County Hospital, from a hematologist, Dr. Waqas Arslan.  A July 2020 VA treatment record documented the Veteran stated he was seeing an outside hematologist.  A November 2020 VA treatment record documented the Veteran had a follow-up appointment tomorrow with the hematologist.  A February 2021 VA treatment record documented Veteran was followed with outside hematologist, but he did not recall the name of that provider.  More recently, a March 2022 VA treatment record documented the Veteran was followed by hematologist, and was advised by his hematologist to discontinue Eliquis.  Thus, failure of the AOJ to request the necessary authorization from the Veteran to obtain private treatment records from a hematologist, Dr. Waqas Arslan, at Maricopa County Hospital, is a pre-decisional duty to assist error and a remand is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these records.  The Veteran may also provide these records himself to VA.

Second, VA is obligated to obtain relevant Social Security Administration records. Relevant records are records that relate to the injury for which the claimant is seeking benefits and have a reasonable possibility of helping to substantiate the claim.  See Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1322 (2010).  Here, the Veteran's Social Security Administration records are not associated with the record nor does the record reflect an attempt has been made to obtain any such records with regard to disability benefits.  The Board finds there is a reasonable possibility that any relevant existing Social Security Administration records may be relevant to this claim, as prior the AOJ decision on appeal, a November 2021 private treatment record documented as to the Veteran's heart failure, that he had hard time adjusting to new diet and activity regime, that he felt tired all the time, and that he recently applied for Social Security.  Also, an August 2021 VA treatment record documented the Veteran reported he had not worked for approximately one year as he has been diagnosed with heart failure, and that he applied for Social Security benefits and was working with a lawyer who specialized in assisting with Social Security applications.  Another August 2021 VA treatment record documented the Veteran reported he had been unable to work for over a year due to diagnosis of heart failure and ongoing difficulties with his knee pain, that he applied for Social Security benefits in June 2021, and was working with a lawyer who specialized in assisting with Social Security applications.  A September 2021 private treatment record documented as to the Veteran's vocation, he was disabled due to a heart condition.  A November 2021 private treatment record documented the Veteran reported as to his heart failure, he was having a hard time adjusting to new a diet and activity regime, that he felt tired all the time, and he recently applied for Social Security.  Therefore, upon remand, due to the AOJ's pre-decisional duty to assist error in not attempting to obtain relevant records from the Social Security Administration, an attempt should be made to obtain any relevant records concerning a claim for disability benefits, from the Social Security Administration.

Also, this claim is inextricably intertwined with the claim remanded above, for service connection for hypertension, and thus, remanded is also warranted for this claim.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).  For example, a January 2008 VA treatment record documented the Veteran's heart was enlarged due to his hypertension, and a May 2021 private treatment record documented the Veteran's transthoracic echocardiogram consistent with diastolic dysfunction was likely secondary to undiagnosed hypertension.  

3. Entitlement to service connection for a right hip disability is remanded. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability is remanded.

The Veteran's claims for service connection for right hip disability and a left hip disability, were received via an application, by VA on September 26, 2022, which was within one year of an intent to file claim, received by VA on September 23, 2022.  In his September 2022 application for benefits, the Veteran argued that his right and left hip disabilities were due to his service-connected right knee disabilities as "I would try and alternate my weight from the right side to left to side, thus putting my weight on the left which is has caused me to have hip pain on the left side of my body."

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to these claims were that claimed primary disability of right hip strain was service-connected and the Veteran had been diagnosed with a left hip disability, as an October 2022 VA examiner endorsed a diagnosis of left hip strain.  Also, in September 2022, the Veteran submitted November 2020 private imaging which provided an impression of mild osteoarthritis of the bilateral hips.  Further, the Board observes at the time of the November 2022 rating decision, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Veteran was service-connected for a right knee disability rated under the Diagnostic Codes for limitation of flexion, limitation of flexion, and recurrent subluxation or instability.  

The Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exist as to these claims, specifically that the AOJ erred insofar it did not obtain an adequate opinion as to whether the Veteran's right hip disability and left hip disability were proximately due to or the result his service-connected right knee disabilities and no opinions addressed whether the Veteran's right hip disability and left hip disability were aggravated by his service-connected right knee disabilities.

In this regard, an October 2022 VA examiner documented the Veteran denied pain in his right hip, reported constant left hip pain, and that he was given x-rays of his hip and told he had osteoarthritis, and endorsed a diagnosis of left hip strain.  However, the October 2022 VA examiner did not address the November 2020 private imaging which provided an impression of mild osteoarthritis of the bilateral hips, and although this is not dated proximate to the appeal period, there is no indication that this has resolved.  The October 2022 VA examiner found the conditions of a bilateral hip condition and right knee strain, post arthroscopic procedure with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, were not medically related as the bilateral hip condition was a separate entity entirely from the right knee strain, post arthroscopic procedure with osteoarthritis and instability status post meniscus tear, and was unrelated to it and a thorough review of medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship.  The October 2022 VA examiner further explained the Veteran had limited complaints of left hip pain in the claims file with only two complaints in a three month span with normal imaging, and that he was diagnosed with a strain on day of this examination.  The October 2022 VA examiner explained that while an injury on one limb can alter gait and cause injury on opposing limb, with the physicality of the Veteran's job as a delivery driver, it was just as likely to cause joint pain, and therefore, she would need to result to mere speculation to determine that the service-connected condition was the cause of Veteran's current left hip strain.  Thus, as the October 2022 VA examiner did not identify what bilateral hip condition was addressed, did not address the November 2020 private imaging which provided an impression of mild osteoarthritis of the bilateral hips, and implied an opinion could not be provided without resorting to mere speculation, the VA examiner's opinion lacks probative value, and the AOJ's failure to obtain adequate opinions on this basis is a pre-decisional error.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311-12 (2007).  Accordingly, remand is warranted for supplemental opinions, with consideration of the Veteran's September 2022 argument that his right and left hip disabilities were due to his service-connected right knee disabilities as "I would try and alternate my weight from the right side to left to side, thus putting my weight on the left which is has caused me to have hip pain on the left side of my body."

Further, opinions were not obtained to as to whether the Veteran's right hip disability and left hip disability were aggravated by his service-connected right knee disabilities, and the AOJ's failure to obtain opinions on this basis is a pre-decisional error.  See El Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013).  Accordingly, remand is warranted for supplemental opinions, with consideration of the Veteran's September 2022 argument that his right and left hip disabilities were due to his service-connected right knee disabilities as "I would try and alternate my weight from the right side to left to side, thus putting my weight on the left which is has caused me to have hip pain on the left side of my body."

The Board also recognizes in the March 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the Veteran's representative also argued that secondary opinions were warranted for the Veteran's bilateral hip condition to determine if it was caused or aggravated by his service-connected bilateral knee condition and left foot condition, and argued an April 2022 VA examination report found the Veteran limped due to his left foot, and a March 2022 VA examination report found the Veteran had bilateral patellar braces required for support and an antalgic gait.  However, without evidence or argument prior to the November 2022 rating decision, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review, that indicated that the Veteran's right or left hip disabilities were related to his service-connected left foot disability, the Board cannot find a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand on this basis.  

5. Entitlement to service connection for a right foot disability

The claim must be readjudicated in the first instance by the AOJ. Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394, 399 (2010).

6. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral arterial disease, claimed as blood clots of the lower right extremity associated with the right knee, is remanded.

The Veteran's claim for service connection for peripheral arterial disease, claimed as blood clots of the lower right extremity associated with the right knee, was received via an application, by VA on October 14, 2021.  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to the Veteran's claim was that he had been diagnosed with a disability as a VA examination diagnosed peripheral arterial disease, and the claimed primary disability, related to the right knee, was service-connected.  Additionally, the Board notes an April 2022 VA examiner endorsed a diagnosis of status post right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.  

The Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exists as to this claim, specifically that the AOJ erred insofar it did not obtain an adequate opinion as to whether the Veteran's post status right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis was proximately due to, or the result of, his service-connected right knee disabilities, and no opinions addressed whether the Veteran's post status right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis was aggravated by his service-connected right knee disabilities.  Further, no opinions addressed whether the Veteran's peripheral arterial disease was secondary to his service-connected right knee disabilities.  

In this regard, an April 2022 VA examiner found that after reviewing all medical evidence it was less likely than not that the Veteran's right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis was incurred in or caused by due to or the result of the his service-connected right knee disabilities.  As a rationale, the April 2022 VA examiner explained no medical records were found for any association based on the medical records attached, and review of preponderant of medical literature failed to support any association, and the conditions were not medically related.  The April 2022 VA examiner found the claimed disorder was a separate entity entirely from the service-connected conditions and unrelated to them.  The April 2022 VA examiner stated the medical literature did not support a medical relationship, and there was no pathophysiological process.  The April 2022 VA examiner also stated there was no evidence from specialists, including a neurologist or orthopedist or surgeon, which supports the claim, that at no point in the Veteran's entire claims file was the deep vein thrombosis attributed to his right knee instability or problem.

The April 2022 VA examiner also provided a list of specific risk factors according to the Mayo Clinic, but also noted sometimes, a blood clot in a vein could occur with no apparent underlying risk factor.  The April 2022 VA examiner found it was not possible to attribute the deep vein thrombosis to any one or group of different risk factors without completely speculating.  However, the April 2022 VA examiner's mere identification of non-service risk factors for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, without more explanation or assertions as to the etiology of the disability in the Veteran's case, do not otherwise present a clear rationale for concluding that the Veteran's lower extremity deep vein thrombosis is unlikely etiologically linked to his military service.  Further, the April 2022 VA examiner did not address the Veteran's diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease.  Thus, the April 2022 VA examiner's opinion lacks probative value, and the AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate opinion on this basis is a pre-decisional error.  See Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 311-12.  Accordingly, remand is warranted for a supplemental opinion.

Further, no opinion was not obtained to as to whether the Veteran's peripheral arterial disease and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis were aggravated by his service-connected right knee disabilities, and the AOJ's failure to obtain an opinion on this basis is a pre-decisional error.  See El Amin, 26 Vet. App. at 140.  Accordingly, remand is warranted for a supplemental opinion.

7. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is remanded.

The Veteran's claim for service connection for a back disability, was received via an application, by VA on February 10, 2022.  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable findings identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to this claim was that the Veteran was diagnosed with a disability, as VA treatment records revealed a diagnosis of chronic back pain.

The Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exist as to these claims, specifically that the AOJ erred insofar it did not obtain a VA examination and corresponding opinion addressing the claim, specifically as to whether the Veteran's diagnosis of chronic back pain, as endorsed as a favorable findings in April 2022 rating decision, was related to service on a direct incurrence basis, with consideration of an October 1992 service treatment record, which documented the Veteran had back pain for one week, and an October 1994 service treatment record, which documented he had low back pain for three days.  See McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 81; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).  Accordingly, remand is warranted for an examination and a corresponding opinion addressing the claim on a direct incurrence basis.

The Board also recognizes in the March 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the Veteran's representative also argued that addendum opinions were warranted to determine whether the Veteran's back disability was secondary to his service-connected bilateral knee condition and left foot condition.  Specifically, the Veteran's representative argued a February 2023 VA treatment record documented the Veteran had an antalgic gait due to his bilateral knee disabilities, April 2022 examination report documented he had a limp due to his left foot, a April 2022 VA examination documented he had had instability and required constant use of a brace due to his right knee, a March 2022 VA examination documented his knees caused antalgic gait, inference with standing, disturbance of location, inference with sitting, swelling, less movement, weakened movement and instability of station, and a July 2021 documented his left foot caused inference with standing, disturbance of location, swelling and a lack of endurance.  However, without evidence or argument prior to the April 2022 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, that the Veteran's reported and documented symptomology as to his service-connected bilateral knees and left foot, were, in fact, connected to the Veteran's back disability, the Board cannot find a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand on this basis.  

8. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

The Veteran's claim to reopen service connection for bilateral hearing loss, was received via a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, by VA on January 10, 2022, which was within one year of an intent to file claim, received by VA on October 26, 2021, as evidenced by a notice letter of the same date.  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable finding identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to this claim was that the evidence showed that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service, as personnel records showed that the Veteran's MOS was a avenger system repairer, which had a high probability of hazardous noise exposure.  However, April 2021 and March 2022 VA examiners provided an adequate opinion addressing the Veteran's right ear hearing loss on a direct incurrence basis.  Further, the April 2021 VA also provided an adequate addressing whether the Veteran's preexisting left ear hearing loss was aggravated by service.  

However, the Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exist as to this claim, specifically that the AOJ errored insofar as the evidence at the time of the September 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, was sufficient to trigger VA's duty to assist in obtaining a supplemental opinion addressing the claim on the basis of participation in TERAs.  Specifically, in January 2024, VA issued a Memorandum which found the Veteran's MOS of avenger crewman (missile system) and collateral duties of an ammunition handler had a high probability of exposure to solvents, rocket and diesel fuel, oils, and lubricants and also that there was high probability of exposure to toxic material used in ammunition as such depleted uranium, phosphorus/phosphates gunpowder residue.  Because the Board is unable to grant this claim at this time, and because the requirements to obtain a medical opinion compliant with 38 U.S.C. § 1168 were met prior to the September 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, but such opinion was not obtained, this is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  Thus, remand is warranted for a supplemental opinion that considers the Veteran's TERAs.

9. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

The Veteran's claim to reopen service connection for tinnitus, was received via a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, by VA on January 10, 2022, which was within one year of an intent to file claim, received by VA on October 26, 2021, as evidenced by a notice letter of the same date.  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The relevant favorable finding identified in the April 2023 rating decision as to this claim was that the evidence showed that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service, as personnel records showed that the Veteran MOS was a avenger system repairer, which had a high probability of hazardous noise exposure.

The Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exist as to this claim, specifically that the AOJ errored insofar as the evidence at the time of the September 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, was sufficient to trigger VA's duty to assist in obtaining a supplemental opinion addressing the claim on the basis of participation in TERAs.  Specifically, in January 2024, VA issued a Memorandum which found the Veteran's MOS of avenger crewman (missile system) and collateral duties of an ammunition handler had a high probability of exposure to solvents, rocket and diesel fuel, oils, and lubricants and also that there was high probability of exposure to toxic material used in ammunition as such depleted uranium, phosphorus/phosphates gunpowder residue.  Because the Board is unable to grant this claim at this time, and because the requirements to obtain a medical opinion compliant with 38 U.S.C. § 1168 were met prior to the September 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, but such opinion was not obtained, this is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  Thus, remand is warranted for a supplemental opinion that considers the Veteran's TERAs.

Also, this claim is inextricably intertwined with the claim remanded above, for service connection for bilateral hearing loss, and thus, remanded is also warranted for this claim.  See Harris, 1 Vet. App. at 183.  For example, a March 2022 VA examiner found the Veteran has a diagnosis of clinical hearing loss, and his tinnitus was at least as likely as not a symptom associated with the hearing loss, as tinnitus was known to be a symptom associated with hearing loss.  

10. Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes is remanded.

11. Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes is remanded.

By way of procedural background, on February 2022, VA received a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, from the Veteran, which requested review of an August 2021 rating decision as the initial ratings and effective dates assigned for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes.  

In response to the February 10, 2022 VA Form 20-0995, the AOJ issued a rating decision in May 2022, which adjudicated claims for increased initial ratings for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes and claims for earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2022 rating decision as to increased initial ratings for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, and also attempted to appeal effective dates assigned for the grant of service connection for these disabilities.  Specifically, the March 2023 VA Form 20-0996 stated "Rating Evaluation & Effective Date - Left Foot & Left Knee" and expressed disagreement with the May 2022 rating decision.   

In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal as to the claims for increased ratings for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 rating decision, but which did not address the claims for earlier effective dates for the grant of service connection for these disabilities.

In the June 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran expressed disagreement as to the April 2023 HLR decision on appeal as to the both the increased initial ratings for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, and also attempted to appeal effective dates assigned for these disabilities.  However, the April 2023 HLR decision on appeal did not assign any affective dates for these disabilities.  Rather the April 2023 HLR decision on appeal continued a 20 percent rating for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and continued a 10 percent rating for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes.  Further, June 2023 VA Form 10182 was not timely as to any other adjudication of as to the assignment of an effective date for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, as it was not received within year of any such adjudication.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  

Thus, it is clear there remains pending appeals as to entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, as the March 2023 VA Form 20-0996, was submitted in response to the May 2022 rating decision as to these issues but these issues were never adjudicated.   

Moreover, the AOJ's failure to adjudicate the issues of entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, following the March 2023 VA Form 20-0996, did not deprive the Board of the ability to address them.  Specifically, a notice of disagreement, which in this case, is similar to the March VA Form 20-0996, can encompass a matter that the AOJ failed to adjudicate but that was reasonably raised to it.  Isenbart v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?537, 540-41 (1995).  Furthermore, a veteran's timely appeal of the AOJ decision may place it within the Board's jurisdiction, and once the Board has jurisdiction over a claim, it has jurisdiction "to address all issues related to that claim," even those not previously addressed by the AOJ, which, in this case, is the appeals as to entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes.  See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?326, 332 (2006).   

When presented with an issue properly before it but not addressed by the AOJ, the Board is required either to adjudicate the issue or, if appropriate, to remand the issue to the AOJ for development and adjudication of the issue.  Id.  (citing Suttman v. Brown, 5?Vet. App.?127, 132 (1993)).   

Therefore, as discussed above, in March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, and requested review of the May 2022 rating decision as entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes.  However, the AOJ did not subsequently issue a rating decision in response to the Veteran's VA Form 20-0996 as to these issues.  Therefore, the AOJ must adjudicate the Veteran's March 2023 VA Form 20-0996, as to entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, de novo, in the first instance so as to avoid any prejudice to the Veteran.  See Hickson v. Shinseki, 23?Vet. App.?394, 399 (2010). 

Thus, remand is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty, specifically to issue a rating decision in response to the Veteran's March 2023 VA Form 20-0996 as to entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes.   

12. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee instability is remanded.

13. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes is remanded.

14. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, is remanded.

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The April 2023 rating decision did not provide any favorable findings as to the claims for an increased initial rating for a right knee instability, left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes.  

A remand is required for the following two pre-decisional duty to assist errors.

First, the Veteran's claim for an increased initial rating for right knee instability, must be adjudicated in the first instance, as it is intertwined with the above decision, which granted an earlier effective date, of December 31, 2020, for the grant of service connection.  Also, the Veteran's claims for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes and entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, are intertwined with the above claims for entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, and thus, remand is also warranted for these claims.  See Harris, 1 Vet. App. at 183.  

Second, VA is obligated to obtain relevant Social Security Administration records.  The Board finds there is a reasonable possibility that any relevant existing Social Security Administration records may be relevant to the claims for initial increased rating for right knee instability, left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes, because, as discussed above, an August 2021 VA treatment record documented the Veteran reported he had been unable to work for over a year due to diagnosis of heart failure and ongoing difficulties with his knee pain, that he applied for Social Security benefits in June 2021 and was working with a lawyer who specialized in assisting with Social Security applications.  Further, another August 2021 VA treatment record documented the Veteran also had a recent foot fracture in May and was still in a CAM walker foot brace, that he was not able to work currently, and was filing for disability.  Therefore, upon remand, due to the AOJ's pre-decisional duty to assist error in not attempting to obtain relevant records from the Social Security Administration, as directed above in the context of the heart claim, an attempt should be made to obtain any relevant records concerning a claim for disability benefits, from the Social Security Administration.

Third, the Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exist as to the claims for initial increased ratings for right knee instability and left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, as the AOJ erred insofar as it did not attempt to obtain potentially relevant private treatment records.  Specifically, an April 2021 private treatment record documented the Veteran was referred to Dr. Kenneth Schmidt for knee problems.  However, no records from Dr. Kenneth Schmidt for knee problems are of record nor have such records been attempted to be obtained.  Thus, failure of the AOJ to request the necessary authorization from the Veteran to obtain private treatment records from Dr. Kenneth Schmidt for knee problems, is a pre-decisional duty to assist error and a remand is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these records.  The Veteran may also provide these records himself to VA.

15. Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

The Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error exists as to this claim, specifically that the AOJ erred as it did not develop this issue as part and parcel of the claims for higher initial ratings for right knee instability, left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes.  Specifically, as noted above, evidence, including August 2021 VA treatment records, documented the Veteran reported he could not work because of these disabilities.  Therefore, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is raised in this case.  This evidence was before the AOJ at the time of the April 2022 and May 2022 rating decisions, but the AOJ did not develop the issue of entitlement to TDIU.  Further, the record does not contain a specific listing of dates of the Veteran's employment, as the AOJ has never adjudicated this matter.  Thus, the Veteran should be requested to provide a completed VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, including the precise dates of employment with employers adequately identified and corresponding earnings and hours.

Finally, the Board advises that, at this time, it intimates no opinion as to the credibility or probative value of any lay statements in relation to the Veteran's claim for a TDIU as well as the above remanded claims for benefits and defers any credibility determinations until final adjudication of these claims.

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Provide the Veteran with VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, for completion, including the precise dates of employment with employers adequately identified and corresponding earnings and hours.

2. After obtaining any necessary authorizations (i.e., a VA Form 21-4142) from the Veteran--and advising him that, alternatively, he can submit the records himself-- please obtain the treatment records from:

(a.) St. Luke's Hospital in Tempe, Arizona, for treatment for hypertension and/or high blood pressure, in 2002 or 2003; 

(b.) Dr. Waqas Arslan, a hematologist, at Maricopa County Hospital at Maricopa County Hospital;

(c.) Dr. Kenneth Schmidt for knee problems.

If appropriate authorization is provided, make two requests for any authorized records, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

3. Obtain and associate with the record all relevant records pertaining to the Veteran concerning a claim for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration, to include all medical records and copies of any disability determination.  Document all requests for information as well as all responses in the claims file.

4. Please adjudicate, in response to the Veteran's March 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the issues entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar and tibial tubercle enthesophytes, and entitlement to an effective date prior to June 30, 2021 for the grant of service connection for left foot, residuals, metatarsal fractures with enthesophytes.

5. Please conduct a de novo review of the claims file and adjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for a right foot disorder, on its merits.

6. Obtain a medical opinion to address the claim for service connection for hypertension.  The clinician is asked to provide a response, with a rationale, to the following:

Whether it is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran's hypertension is related to the TERAs during his service, including with consideration that his MOS of avenger crewman (missile system) and collateral duties of an ammunition handler, had a high probability of exposure to loud and excessive noise, a high probability of exposure to solvents, rocket and diesel fuel, oils, and lubricants, and a high probability of exposure to toxic material used in ammunition as such depleted uranium, phosphorus/phosphates gunpowder residue, as documented in January 2024 VA Memorandum?  In rendering this opinion, the clinician is asked to consider and discuss the Veteran's total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs. 

7. Obtain medical opinions to address the claims for service connection for a right hip disability and a left hip disability.  The clinician is asked to provide a response, with a rationale, to the following:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher), the Veteran's right hip osteoarthritis, as indicated in November 2020 private imaging, is proximately due to or the result his service-connected right knee disabilities, with consideration of the Veteran's September 2022 argument that his right and left hip disabilities were due to his service-connected right knee disabilities as "I would try and alternate my weight from the right side to left to side, thus putting my weight on the left which is has caused me to have hip pain on the left side of my body"?

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher), the Veteran's left hip osteoarthritis, as indicated in November 2020 private imaging, and left hip strain, as diagnosed by an October 2022 VA examiner, are proximately due to or the result his service-connected right knee disabilities, with consideration of the Veteran's September 2022 argument that his right and left hip disabilities were due to his service-connected right knee disabilities as "I would try and alternate my weight from the right side to left to side, thus putting my weight on the left which is has caused me to have hip pain on the left side of my body"?

(c.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher), the Veteran's right hip osteoarthritis, as indicated in November 2020 private imaging, is at least as likely as not aggravated (any increase in disability) by his service-connected right knee disabilities, with consideration of the Veteran's September 2022 argument that his right and left hip disabilities were due to his service-connected right knee disabilities as "I would try and alternate my weight from the right side to left to side, thus putting my weight on the left which is has caused me to have hip pain on the left side of my body"?

(d.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher), the Veteran's left hip osteoarthritis, as indicated in November 2020 private imaging, and left hip strain, as diagnosed by an October 2022 VA examiner, are at least as likely as not aggravated (any increase in disability) by his service-connected right knee disabilities, with consideration of the Veteran's September 2022 argument that his right and left hip disabilities were due to his service-connected right knee disabilities as "I would try and alternate my weight from the right side to left to side, thus putting my weight on the left which is has caused me to have hip pain on the left side of my body"?

8. Obtain medical opinions to address the claim for service connection for peripheral arterial disease.  The clinician is asked to provide a response, with a rationale, to the following:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher), the Veteran's peripheral arterial disease and/or right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, as diagnosed by an April 2022 VA examiner, is proximately due to or the result his service-connected right knee disabilities?

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher), the Veteran's peripheral arterial disease and/or right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, as diagnosed by an April 2022 VA examiner, is at least as likely as not aggravated (any increase in disability) by his service-connected right knee disabilities?

9. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to address his claims for service connection for a back disability. The clinician is asked to provide a response, with a rationale, to the following:

Whether it is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran has a back disability, to include chronic back pain, which is related to his service, including with consideration of an October 1992 service treatment record, which documented the Veteran had back pain for one week, and an October 1994 service treatment record, which documented he had low back pain for three days?

10. Obtain a medical opinion to address the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  The clinician is asked to provide a response, with a rationale, to the following:

Whether it is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran's hearing loss of either ear is related to the TERAs during his service, including with consideration that his MOS of avenger crewman (missile system) and collateral duties of an ammunition handler, had a high probability of exposure to loud and excessive noise, a high probability of exposure to solvents, rocket and diesel fuel, oils, and lubricants, and a high probability of exposure to toxic material used in ammunition as such depleted uranium, phosphorus/phosphates gunpowder residue, as documented in January 2024 VA Memorandum?  In rendering this opinion, the clinician is asked to consider and discuss the Veteran's total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs. 

11. Obtain a medical opinion to address the claim for service connection for tinnitus.  The clinician is asked to provide a response, with a rationale, to the following:

Whether it is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran's tinnitus is related to the TERAs during his service, including with consideration that his MOS of avenger crewman (missile system) and collateral duties of an ammunition handler, had a high probability of exposure to loud and excessive noise, a high probability of exposure to solvents, rocket and diesel fuel, oils, and lubricants, and a high probability of exposure to toxic material used in ammunition as such depleted uranium, phosphorus/phosphates gunpowder residue, as documented in January 2024 VA Memorandum?  In rendering this opinion, the clinician is asked to consider and discuss the Veteran's total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs.
