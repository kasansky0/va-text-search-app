REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Air Force from August 1981 to August 1985.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an appeal of a September 2024 rating decision.  In the rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) indicated that a mandated special review had occurred on April 9, 2024, and the AOJ denied the above-captioned claims and other claims that the Veteran did not appeal.  Importantly, the AOJ did not indicate that the consideration of evidence prior to the issuance of the September 2024 was in any way qualified or limited.

In his August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decision, as described above, on appeal.  

If evidence was added during the ineligible period, it has not been considered.  If this is the case, and the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any of this evidence, he can at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving a decision and the additional evidence would be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim would preserve the date of the claim as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

As a final introductory note, the Court has held that, because 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) "gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up."  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024).  As the Board is granting the benefits sought in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in adjudicating these matters prior to expiration of the relevant period.

Service Connection: Applicable Law

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F. 3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.57, "It is essential to make an initial distinction between bilateral flatfoot as a congenital or as an acquired condition."  Upon scrutiny of the Veteran's March 1981 enlistment report of medication examination, the Air Force examiner reported no clinical evaluations of the Veteran's bilateral feet and bilateral lower extremities.  This report includes no medical notations as to bilateral pes planus.  Consequently, the Veteran's feet are presumed to have been in sound condition at entrance and his bilateral pes planus is an acquired condition.  38 U.S.C. § 1111.

Sleep apnea; right foot disability; left foot disability; lumbar strain; right shoulder tendinopathy; left shoulder tendinopathy; right hand tendinopathy; and left hand tendinopathy

The Veteran has raised other theories of entitlement including as due to toxic exposure in service.  Considering the instant favorable decision to grant service connection on a direct basis for these disabilities, a discussion of any other theory of entitlement is not necessary, as such would not result in an earlier effective date.  Johnson v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-7589, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 383 (Mar. 26, 2025) (indicating that effective date consequences can be considered by the Board in cases in which the issue before it is entitlement to service connection). Cf. Stender v. Wilkie, No. 19-0068, 2020 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 520, *5-*7 (Mar. 27, 2020) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) (the Board erred in granting service connection based on the Camp Lejeune Contaminated Water (CLCW) presumption without considering other theories of entitlement that could warrant an earlier effective date because of the effective date of the CLCW presumption); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

For the following reasons, entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea; right foot disability; left foot disability; lumbar strain; right shoulder tendinopathy; left shoulder tendinopathy; right hand tendinopathy; and left hand tendinopathy is warranted, on a direct basis.

Upon a June 2024 battery of VA examination report, clinicians rendered diagnoses of sleep apnea; right foot pes planus and plantar fasciitis; left foot pes planus and plantar fasciitis; lumbar strain; right shoulder tendinopathy; left shoulder tendinopathy; right hand tendinopathy; and left hand tendinopathy.  Therefore, the current disability requirement for each of these 8 disabilities has been met.

The Veteran is competent to report discernable and on-going symptoms, to include ongoing symptoms of erratic sleeping, snoring, gasping, and daytime fatigue that began in service when he was in "his 20s" and continue to the present day (sleep apnea); discernable bilateral foot pain and soreness that began performing his arduous duties as a pavements maintenance specialist and persist through the present day (bilateral foot disabilities); discernable lower back and bilateral shoulder symptoms of stiffness and tension that first surfaced after constant bending and lifting heavy machinery in service and have been on-going ever since (lumbar strain and bilateral shoulder disabilities); and discernable bilateral hand pain and functional limitations of bilateral finger locking and difficulty gripping that began while using heavy equipment, post hole diggers, and pick axes performing his duties in service and have continued through the present day (bilateral hand disabilities).  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (a veteran is competent to testify regarding observations); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1337 (holding lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence).  The Board finds that the Veteran's lay accounts are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of service, and there is nothing of equal or greater probative weight in the evidence of record to contradict these credible lay accounts discernable and ongoing symptoms culminating in the above noted diagnosis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (each disabling condition for which a veteran seeks service connection must be considered based on factors including the basis of places, types, and circumstances of service as shown by service records).   As to sleep apnea specifically, the Court reasoned in Maples v. Wilkie, No. 18-2016, 2019 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 199 (Feb. 11, 2019) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.), given the observable nature of its symptoms, sleep apnea is the type of disability for which lay evidence can be sufficient to support a claim for service connection.  The Board finds this reasoning persuasive.  Bethea, 2 Vet. App. 252.  Moreover, as to the Veteran's bilateral foot disability, the Court has held that a lay person, like the Veteran, is competent to testify to pain and visible flatness of his feet.  See Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 403.  Therefore, the in-service disease or injury requirements for these 8 disabilities have been met and continuous symptoms since service have been shown. 

The clinicians who conducted the June 2024 battery of examinations (each focused on particular claimed disabilities) all rendered negative etiological opinions.  While the clinicians referenced the absence of symptoms in the service treatment records, and lack of "chronicity of care", the Veteran's competent and consistent lay accounts made to the examiners were not given any significant consideration in the negative opinions.  Due to these clinicians' minimal consideration of the consistent and credible lay statements of the Veteran, the Board finds that this battery of negative etiological opinions is inadequate.  Buchanan, 451 F. 3d at 1336, n. 1 (the VA's clinician's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence").

While the Board could remand for addenda (to consider the credible lay evidence adequately), such a remand might well be interpreted as an attempt to develop evidence with the intent of denying the Veteran's service connection claims, especially in light of the Veteran's competent, plausible, internally consistent, and credible accounts of his discernable symptoms from service through the present day.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim").  Moreover, to the extent that these grants of service connection are based upon credible lay evidence rather than positive medical opinions as to direct causation, "nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] requires both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself."  Buchanan, 451 F. 3d at 1335.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence is sufficient to decide this service connection claims, as it is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea, right foot disability, left foot disability, lumbar strain, right shoulder tendinopathy, left shoulder tendinopathy, right hand tendinopathy, and left hand tendinopathy all had onset in service.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for these 8 disabilities is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or the other is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
