INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1974 to September 1994. The Veteran died in September 2021. An April 2022 letter recognized the Veteran's surviving spouse as a substitute claimant for accrued benefits purposes. 

These matters are on appeal from a June 2020 rating decision. An August 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, elected the evidence submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with or within 90 days from receipt of the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.303.

An April 2024 Board decision denied entitlement to service connection for metastatic liver disease and gastric cancer. The appellant appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). A November 2024 Court Order vacated the Board decision and remanded the matters on appeal for adjudication consistent with the Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) by the parties

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for metastatic liver disease

2. Entitlement to service connection for gastric cancer

The November 2024 JMR found the Board erred when it failed to ensure the pre-decisional duty to assist in obtaining identified federal medical treatment records. Specifically, the JMR stated the Veteran provided a release when he filed his service connection claims in April 2020, noting he was treated at Darnell Army Medical Center at Fort Hood (DACH) in February 2020. See April 2020 VA Form 21-4142a. VA obtained those records. The JMR noted the record also reflected the Veteran was treated at DACH since his retirement from active duty in 1995. See April 1998 VA Form 21-8359. The JMR found VA was aware of the Veteran's history of treatment at DACH and should have attempted to obtain the Veteran's treatment records from 1995 to 2020. 

Accordingly, remand is warranted for the AOJ to make reasonable efforts to obtain DACH medical records from 1995 to 2020 pursuant to 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.159.
