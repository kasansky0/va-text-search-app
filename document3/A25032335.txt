ORDER

Eligibility to attorney fees, based on past-due benefits awarded in a September 2020 rating decision, is granted.

?

FINDING OF FACT

The Regional Office (RO) incorrectly calculated attorney fees based on the cash payment to the Veteran, rather than the full amount of the award prior to offset due to previous receipt of military retirement pay.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to attorney fees, based on the past-due benefits from the September 2020 rating decision, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1982 to June 2002.

The appellant is the Veteran's attorney representative.

The case is on appeal from a September 2020 decision.

The appellant timely filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) to the September 2020 fee decision and elected the Hearing docket.  In November 2023, the Veteran was provided a copy of the appellant's NOD pursuant to contested claims procedures, and did not file a response.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403-4.

A hearing for the contested claim was scheduled in October 2024; however, the appellant cancelled their hearing request at the time of the hearing.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or the Veteran within 90 days following the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302(b), 20.405.  In this case, no additional evidence, only argument, has been received since the September 2020 decision.

Attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a September 2020 rating decision.

Legal Criteria

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904. 

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA.  The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney, and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1). 

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits.  A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).

Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f).  When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2). 

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1); Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024); Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28 (2023).

Analysis

In May 2018, the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22a appointing the appellant as his representative.  The parties also executed a fee agreement at that time, which provided that the appellant was entitled to 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran.

At the time of her appointment, the appellant filed on behalf of the Veteran a NOD to a February 2018 rating decision that granted service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy at a 10 percent evaluation, and denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for multiple skin lesions.  In September 2020, the Veteran was granted an increased rating of 20 percent for left lower radiculopathy, and an increased rating of 30 percent for multiple skin lesions, both effective from July 19, 2017.

In a September 2020 fee decision letter, the Veteran and the appellant were advised that the cash payment from the September 2020 rating decision award was reduced to $0.00 due to withholding based on the Veteran's receipt of military separation pay.  Additionally, while the RO found that all the requirements for direct payment of fees had been met, no fees were due to the appellant because no retroactive benefits were being awarded to the Veteran.

The appellant timely filed a NOD in November 2020 to the September 2020 fee decision, and in November 2023, the Veteran was provided a copy of the appellant's NOD pursuant to contested claims procedures.

The Board finds that the appellant is eligible to attorney fees to bring her to the full amount of 20 percent of the past-due benefits awarded in the September 2020 rating decision.  

Although the Veteran's cash payment was reduced due to his receipt of concurrent military retirement pay, the appellant's fee is not to be reduced.  Instead, the appellant is entitled to payment of fees in the amount of the full 20 percent of the past-due benefits awarded, regardless of the amount ultimately payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020).

In sum, the appellant is eligible for attorney fees based on 20 percent of the past-due benefits awarded, prior to concurrent military retirement pay offset.  The appellant is entitled to be compensated to bring her to an amount equivalent to the full 20 percent of the total past-due benefits awarded in the September 2020 rating decision.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 5904.  The appeal is therefore granted in the appellant's favor.
