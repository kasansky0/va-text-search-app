REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from February 1973 to February 1977 and from October 1985 to October 1988. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of the March 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 RO decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with regard to the duty to notify or duty to assist as they pertain to the issues considered in this decision. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The analysis in this decision focuses on the most relevant evidence and on what the evidence shows or does not show with respect to the issues denied in this decision. The Veteran should not assume that evidence that is not explicitly discussed in this decision has been overlooked. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (noting that the law requires only that reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant be addressed).

EFFECTIVE DATES

The effective date based on the submission of new and material evidence received after a final disallowance is the date of the receipt of the new claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.40(q)(2) (previously 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(1)(ii)), 3.400(r). The effective date for the grant of service connection following a final decision is the date of the reopened claim. See Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 248 (2002) (holding that 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) "is clear on its face with respect to granting an effective date for an award of VA periodic monetary benefits no earlier than the date that the claim for reopening was filed").

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) explained that the statutory framework does not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits based on a reopened claim. Id. (holding that the term "new claim," as it appeared in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q), means a claim to reopen a previously and finally decided claim).

Regulations that were in effect prior to March 24, 2015, required that an informal claim "must identify the benefit sought." See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160. The regulations also provided that a claim may be either a formal or informal written communication "requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). The regulations in effect since March 24, 2015, do not allow for informal claims that are not submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160. The Board will apply the regulations in effect prior to March 24, 2015, for all communications received prior to March 24, 2015.	

Thus, the essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009). VA must look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as applications or claims, formal and informal, for benefits and is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits. Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992). However, VA is not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155). The amendments apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

A specific claim in the form prescribed by VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a) (previously 38 U.S.C. § 3001(a)); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application, therefore. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) (previously 38 U.S.C. § 3010(a)). The effective date for an award of service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date is the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement to service connection arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Further, under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). For decisions rendered after a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182. Id. For supplemental claims received more than one year after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

A claimant may withdraw a supplemental claim or a request for a higher-level review at any time before VA renders a decision on the issue. A claimant must submit in writing or through electronic submission in a manner prescribed by the Secretary any notice of withdrawal of an issue under the selected review option to the agency of original jurisdiction. The withdrawal will be effective the date VA receives it. A claimant may withdraw an appeal to the Board of Veteran's Appeals as prescribed in § 20.205. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(d)

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must be against the claim. Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).

6. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 7, 2018 for entitlement to service connection for cerebellar ataxia affecting left cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) 

7. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 7, 2018 for entitlement to service connection for cerebellar ataxia affecting right cranial nerve X (vagus) 

8. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 7, 2018 for entitlement to service connection for cerebellar ataxia affecting left cranial nerve X (vagus) 

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date prior to December 7, 2018 for entitlement to service connection for cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral lower extremities. The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date prior to September 15, 2021 for his cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus cranial nerves. The Veteran has not presented any particular argument as to why an earlier effective date is warranted.

On December 7, 2018, the Veteran filed an intent to file form. On March 28, 2019, the Veteran submitted a formal claim for an increased evaluation for depression and entitlement to service connection for lower extremity ataxia. In September 2019, the Veteran was afforded VA examinations for peripheral nerves, and mental health. In the September mental health examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had poor balance, speech, and shakiness- symptoms that the Veteran reported became severe in the 90's. The Veteran reported that the symptoms were related to working with solvent in Navy. He breathed solvent while working in shop for 3 years. His neurologist indicated that he has cerebellum damage.

In the October 2019 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for cerebellar ataxia affecting left lower extremity, effective December 7, 2018, and ataxia affecting right lower extremity, effective December 7, 2018. Later in a separate October 2019 rating decision, the Veteran's disability ratings were continued. In May 2020, the Veteran filed a request for a higher-level review appealing the effective date and disability rating. In the September 2020 rating decision, the RO denied the Veteran's claims for an earlier effective date, and higher disability rating for ataxia affecting bilateral lower extremities. In September 2021, the Veteran filed a formal claim for a TDIU. 

In October 2021, the Veteran filed a formal claim for loss of balance, and loss of speech. In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a letter from his doctor noting that the Veteran had severe ataxia as a result of TCE exposure while in the military. In the December 2021 rating decision, the RO again denied the Veteran's claims for an earlier effective date, and higher disability rating for ataxia affecting bilateral lower extremities, and deferred the Veteran's claims for loss of speech and a TDIU. In the February 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for separate ratings for cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus cranial nerves, effective September 15, 2021 (the right cerebellar ataxia affecting right cranial nerve XII (facial) was given an effective date of October 11, 2021).

 In December 2022, the Veteran filed a request for higher level review for all of his cerebellar ataxia claims to include effective dates and disability ratings. In the March 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded an earlier effective date of September 15, 2021 for his right cerebellar ataxia affecting right cranial nerve XII (facial) disability. He was also awarded a TDIU, and Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status with an effective date of September 15, 2021. His claims for earlier effective dates prior to September 15, 2021 and higher disability ratings for his cerebellar ataxia were denied. In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement.

The Board finds that an earlier effective date prior to December 17, 2018 for entitlement to service connection for cerebellar ataxia affecting right lower extremity, and for cerebellar ataxia affecting left lower extremity is not warranted. The Veteran filed an intent to file form on December 17, 2018. There were no communications received from the Veteran prior to December 17, 2018, that reasonably can be interpreted as an informal or formal claim for entitlement to service connection for cerebellar ataxia affecting right lower extremity, or for cerebellar ataxia affecting left lower extremity.

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim on December 17, 2018 reasonably raised all of his claims regarding cerebellar ataxia. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran specifically indicated that his legs were affected. However, in September 2019, the Veteran was afforded VA examinations for peripheral nerves, and mental health. In the September 2019 mental health examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had poor balance, speech, and shakiness- symptoms that the Veteran reported became severe in the 90's. The September 2019 VA examiner noted that the Veteran reported that his neurologist indicated that he has cerebellum damage. 

In the September 2019 peripheral nerve examination, the examiner noted that the cerebellum receives information from the sensory systems, the spinal cord, and other parts of the brain and then regulates motor movements. The cerebellum coordinates voluntary movements such as posture, balance, coordination, and speech, resulting in smooth and balanced muscular activity. The Board finds that all of the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia conditions should have been considered, especially since the symptoms are interrelated, and the Veteran's initial examinations noted these symptoms, and were caused by the same exposure. See Comer v. Peake, 552 F.3d 1362, 1367 (2009) (recognizing that "the determination of whether an issue has been properly raised must be made with due regard for VA's duty to read a veteran's submissions sympathetically").

Thus, the Board finds that an entitlement date of December 17, 2018 is warranted for the Veteran's claims for entitlement of service connection for cerebellar ataxia affecting bilateral cranial nerves XII (facial), cerebellar ataxia affecting bilateral cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal), and cerebellar ataxia affecting bilateral cranial nerves X (vagus).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal in the veteran's favor, the claim must be denied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

In this case, the Board does not find that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, for an earlier effective date prior to December 17, 2018 for entitlement to service connection for cerebellar ataxia affecting right lower extremity, and for cerebellar ataxia affecting left lower extremity. There were no communications received from the Veteran prior to December 17, 2018, that reasonably can be interpreted as an informal or formal claim for entitlement to service connection for cerebellar ataxia affecting right lower extremity, or for cerebellar ataxia affecting left lower extremity. Thus, the Veteran is in receipt of the earliest possible effective date for these conditions. The Board resolved reasonable doubt and awarded the Veteran an effective date of December 18, 2018 for his claims for service connection for his bilateral cerebellar ataxia affecting the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves.

INCREASED DISABILITY RATINGS

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21; see also Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings," in all claims for increased ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999).

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for cerebellar ataxia affecting right lower extremity 

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for cerebellar ataxia affecting left lower extremity 

3. Entitlement of a disability rating of 20 percent for cerebellar ataxia affecting right cranial nerve XII (facial)

4. Entitlement of a disability rating of 20 percent for cerebellar ataxia affecting right cranial nerve XII (facial)

5. Entitlement of a disability rating of 20 percent for cerebellar ataxia affecting right cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal)

6. Entitlement of a disability rating of 20 percent for cerebellar ataxia affecting left cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal)

7. Entitlement of a disability rating of 30 percent for cerebellar ataxia affecting right cranial nerve X (vagus)

8. Entitlement of a disability rating of 30 percent for cerebellar ataxia affecting left cranial nerve X (vagus)

The Veteran seeks a higher disability rating for his cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral lower extremities, bilateral facial, bilateral glossopharyngeal, and bilateral vagus nerves. The applicable rating period is from December 17, 2018, the effective date of service connection for that disability, through the present. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

LEGAL CRITERIA

Under Diagnostic Code 8521, a 10 percent rating is warranted for mild incomplete paralysis. A 20 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis. A 30 percent rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis. A 40 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis, which is manifested by foot drop and slight droop of the first phalanges of all toes, inability to dorsiflex the foot, loss of extension (dorsal flexion) of the proximal phalanges of the toes; loss of abduction of foot, weakened adduction; and anesthesia covering the entire dorsum of foot and toes.

Under Diagnostic Code 8207, a 10 percent rating is for application when there is incomplete, moderate paralysis of the seventh (facial) cranial nerve, a 20 percent rating is for incomplete, severe paralysis; and a 30 percent evaluation for paralysis that is complete. These ratings are to be assigned "[d]ependent upon [the] relative loss of innervations of facial muscles." Diagnostic Code 8207. (Where the schedule does not provide a 0 percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a 0 percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31).

Under Diagnostic Code 8209, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis of the nerve, a 20 percent rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis, and a 30 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis. Id. The ratings to be assigned are dependent upon the relative loss of organs of voice, respiration, pharynx, stomach, and heart. Id., Note.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124(a), Diagnostic Code 8405, a 10 percent disability rating is assigned where the evidence shows incomplete moderate paralysis of the trigeminal nerve. A 30 percent disability rating is appropriate for disabilities marked by incomplete severe paralysis of the trigeminal nerve. A 50 percent disability rating is warranted where the evidence shows that there has been complete paralysis of the trigeminal nerve. 

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124. The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. According to MERRIAM WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY (11th Ed. 2007), "mild" means temperate, not severe, or not being or involving what is extreme. "Moderate" means tending toward the mean or average amount, or not violent, severe, or intense. "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017). 

Summary of Relevant Evidence

In September 2019, the Veteran was afforded a peripheral nerves VA examination. The examiner indicated that the Veteran has a diagnosis of bilateral cerebellar ataxia. The Veteran reported that in 1980 he was having ataxia and uncoordinated movements. He stated he was told he had damage to the cerebellum. The examiner noted that the Veteran does not have any symptoms attributable to any peripheral nerve conditions. The Veteran's strength was limited to 4/5, and his reflexes were hypoactive. The sensory examination was normal. He has an abnormal gait due to ataxia, exposure to solvent. The Veteran's nerves were normal. He occasionally used a cane as an assistive device. No EMG testing was performed. 

The examiner indicated that the Veteran's bilateral cerebellar ataxia impacted the Veteran's ability to work, as the Veteran lacks coordination and is unable to have balance. The examiner noted that the cerebellum receives information from the sensory systems, the spinal cord, and other parts of the brain and then regulates motor movements. The cerebellum coordinates voluntary movements such as posture, balance, coordination, and speech, resulting in smooth and balanced muscular activity.

In October 2021, the Veteran was afforded a peripheral nerves VA examination. The examiner indicated that the Veteran has a diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia affecting right lower extremity, and cerebellar ataxia affecting left lower extremity. The Veteran reported that since the onset of his condition his symptoms have worsened. He reported worsening pain, numbness, tingling and weakness right greater than left. He reported that he has had several falls and near falls secondary to lower extremity weakness. 

The examiner indicated that the Veteran has symptoms attributable to a peripheral nerve condition including moderate constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness. The Veteran had limited strength 3/5 in the right knee extension, right ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. The Veteran had limited strength 4/5 in the left knee extension, right ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. The Veteran's reflexes were hypoactive in the right knee and ankle. The Veteran had decreased sensation in the bilateral thigh/knee, lower leg/ankle, and foot/toes. The Veteran's gait was abnormal, he had a limp due to cerebellar ataxia affecting left lower extremity, cerebellar ataxia affecting right lower extremity. 

The examiner indicated that the Veteran had incomplete paralysis of the external popliteal (common peroneal) nerve bilaterally, that was moderate in severity. The Veteran reported that he used a cane regularly as an assistive device. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting right lower extremity, and cerebellar ataxia affecting left lower extremity impacts the Veteran's ability to work. Specifically, the Veteran's disability prevents him from standing or walking for prolonged periods of time. 

In February 2022, the Veteran was afforded a cranial nerves diseases examination. The examiner indicated that the Veteran has a diagnosis of motor impairment in the cranial nerves VII, IX, X, which the examiner noted were affected by the Veteran's condition. The Veteran's medical history includes, slow, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing.  The examiner noted that the Veteran was hospitalized for one week during active duty for w/o of psychomotor slowing and noted during admission to have dysarthric speech. Follow up was recommended to rule out causes but there is no record of follow up in service treatment records and the Veteran stated he had none.

The Veteran has symptoms include mild difficulty chewing and swallowing, and moderate difficulty speaking. Muscle testing revealed mild limitation of the bilateral cranial nerve VII, upper portion of face: (motor: muscles of facial expression, shuts eyes tightly); cranial nerve VII, lower portion of face:(motor: muscles of facial expression; grins); cranial nerve IX, X: (motor: swallow, cough, palate elevation; "say ah," gag reflex if indicated. 

The examiner noted that the Veteran's cranial nerve VII (facial) manifested as incomplete paralysis that was severe bilaterally. The cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) manifested as incomplete paralysis that was severe bilaterally. The cranial nerve x (vagus) manifested as incomplete paralysis that was moderate bilaterally. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's cranial nerve disabilities impact the Veteran's ability to work. Specifically, the Veteran reported that his disabilities limit the Veteran's ability to communicate. The symptoms include slurring and rambling speech causing him to relate poorly to customers at his part time job. 

Cerebellar Ataxia - bilateral lower extremities

The Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral lower extremities is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8599-8521 prior to September 15, 2021, and Diagnostic Code 8521 thereafter. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when an unlisted disability is at issue. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. The second diagnostic code provides further detail regarding the origins of the unlisted disability, the bodily functions affected, the symptomatology, and anatomical location. Thus, the diagnostic code following the hyphen is the diagnostic code by which the disability is evaluated by analogy.

The Board finds that a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral lower extremities is not warranted. The Board considered the Veteran's lay statements and October 2021 and February 2022 VA examinations. The probative evidence weighs against finding that the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral lower extremities manifested as severe, as both examiners found that the Veteran's severity remained moderate. The Board notes that the terms "mild," "moderate," and "severe" are relative in nature and that the VA examiners, as medical professionals, are competent to assess the severity of the Veteran's service-connected cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral lower extremities relative to the potential severity of the disability as it generally occurs. 

Although the examiners' use of the term "moderate" is not dispositive of the issue, their use of that term is persuasive in view of the other evidence of record and their expertise as medical professionals. The Veteran's strength was limited to at most to 3/5 on the right, and 4/5 on the left. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has an abnormal gait, but a limp does not demonstrate that the Veteran's symptoms are severe. The Board finds that the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral lower extremities symptoms manifest as moderate, which corresponds with a 20 percent disability rating, and thus a disability rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted.

Cerebellar ataxia - bilateral facial

The Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral facial nerves is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8207. 

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor the Board finds that a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral facial nerves. The Board acknowledges that the February 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran had mild difficulty chewing and swallowing, and moderate difficulty speaking. However, the examiner also noted that the Veteran's cranial nerve VII (facial) manifested as incomplete paralysis that was severe bilaterally. The Board finds that the examiner's report contains conflicting information, but finds that resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor his bilateral facial nerve disability manifests as severe. The probative evidence is against finding that the Veteran's bilateral facial nerves manifested as a complete paralysis, and thus a disability rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted.

Cerebellar ataxia - glossopharyngeal

The Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral glossopharyngeal nerves is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8209. 

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor the Board finds that a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral glossopharyngeal nerves. The Board acknowledges that the February 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran had mild difficulty chewing and swallowing, and moderate difficulty speaking. However, the examiner also noted that the Veteran's cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) manifested as incomplete paralysis that was severe bilaterally. The Board finds that the examiner's report contains conflicting information, but finds that resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor his bilateral glossopharyngeal nerve disability manifests as severe. The probative evidence is against finding that the Veteran's bilateral glossopharyngeal nerves manifested as a complete paralysis, and thus a disability rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted.

Cerebellar ataxia - Vagus

The Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral vagus nerves is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8210. 

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor the Board finds that a 30 percent disability rating is warranted for the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral vagus nerves. The Board acknowledges that the February 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran had mild difficulty chewing and swallowing, and moderate difficulty speaking. However, the examiner also noted that the Veteran's cranial nerve X (vagus) manifested as incomplete paralysis that was severe bilaterally. The Board finds that the examiner's report contains conflicting information, but finds that resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor his bilateral vagus nerve disability manifests as severe. The probative evidence is against finding that the Veteran's bilateral vagus nerves manifested as a complete paralysis, and thus a disability rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal in the veteran's favor, the claim must be denied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In this case, the Board does not find that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, as the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral lower extremities manifests as moderate. The Board resolved reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and determined that the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia affecting his bilateral facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves manifested as severe, but did not result in complete paralysis. 

9. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent prior to September 15, 2021 unspecified depressive disorder

10. Entitlement to a disability rating of 70 percent from September 15, 2021 for unspecified depressive disorder

The Veteran seeks higher disability ratings for his unspecified depressive disorder. The applicable rating period is from December 7, 2017, one year prior to the receipt of the claim, through the present. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994) (discussing the one-year "look-back" period for non-initial increased rating claims).

The Veteran is service connected for unspecified depressive disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435, with a disability rating of 10 percent from March 1, 1979, 30 percent from May 8, 2018, and a 50 percent disability rating from September 15, 2021. 

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages.  Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

A 30 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, or mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events), cause occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation).

A 50 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name cause total occupational and social impairment.

When determining the appropriate disability rating to assign, the Board's primary consideration is the Veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact the Veteran's occupational and social impairment. Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 118; Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442. Because the use of the term "such as" in the rating criteria demonstrates that the listed symptoms are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating. Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442; see also Sellers v. Principi, 372 F.3d 1318, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Nevertheless, all ratings in the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders are also associated with objectively observable symptomatology, and the plain language of the regulation makes it clear that a Veteran may only qualify for a given disability by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration. Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 118.

Summary of the Relevant Evidence 

In October 2018, the Veteran was contacted regarding his mental health, and the care manager noted that the Veteran was oriented x4, and the Veteran's mood, speech, and tone were within normal limits. There was no cognitive impairment noted at time of call. The Veteran communicated that he was not in need of care management services at this time.

In September 2019 the Veteran was afforded with a VA examination for his mental disorders. The examiner indicated that the Veteran has a diagnosis of unspecified depressive disorder. The examiner noted that the Veteran has poor balance, speech, and shakiness- symptoms became severe in the 90's. The Veteran believes his symptoms are related to working with solvent in Navy, he breathed solvent while working in shop for 3 years. He reported having cerebellum damage according to his neurologist. The examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms manifest as a mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough either to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication. 

The examiner indicated that the Veteran lives alone. He was married and divorced twice. He is not dating, and does not have any children. He spends time with friends from church and the moose lodge. He enjoys going to the library. The Veteran has worked maintenance and various jobs. He has been working part time since 2015, but was out recently due to a hernia operation. He has never been fired from a job. The Veteran's current mental health problems were described as when the Veteran has balance problems, he feels frustrated and depressed. He stays home often because others make mean comments. He has some anger, and some anxiety and worry related to his health. He does not have any hopelessness. He has not been hospitalized since the last evaluation. The examiner noted no SI/HI, no mental health meds, no problems with appetite and no ongoing sleep issues. The Veteran's current symptoms include depressed mood and anxiety.

The examiner observed that the Veteran dressed appropriately for the weather and good hygiene. He had good eye contact. His mood and affect within normal range. The Veteran's tone, rate and volume of speech were normal. There was no evidence of hallucinations, delusions or thought disorder. He was oriented in all spheres. He denied suicidal/homicidal ideation, plan, or intent. His insight and judgment were good.

In November 2020, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his mental health disability. The examiner indicated that the Veteran has a diagnosis of unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress. The examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms manifest as an occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or; symptoms controlled by medication. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's symptoms include a depressed mood and anxiety. The examiner observed the Veteran and noted that he presented as dysphoric and with a constricted affect.  He was alert and oriented.  He did not evince any disturbances in speech, thought, memory, concentration, or behavior. His insight and judgment were estimated as fair. The Veteran is capable of managing his financial affairs.

In October 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his mental health disability. The examiner indicated that the Veteran has a diagnosis of unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress. The examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms manifest as an occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. The Veteran reported that he currently works 10 hours a week, and has difficulty processing information and completing his duties. The Veteran reported that he is isolated from others due to his ataxia; he stated that he feels more self-conscious of being among people. The Veteran's current symptoms include depressed mood; anxiety; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events; flattened affect; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting. 

The examiner observed that the Veteran was alert and oriented to time place and person. He was adequately dressed and groomed. The Veteran's speech was slurred and rambling. The Veteran had difficulty remaining on topic. His affect was flat, and mood was dysphoric. He denied SI or HI currently. There was evidence of a thought or perceptual disturbance. The Veteran is capable of managing his financial affairs.

In October 2021, the Veteran submitted a witness statement. The Veteran's friend/co-worker/ fellow military veteran indicated that the Veteran had difficulty at times dealing with customers. The Veteran's cognitive and speech issues made it difficult for customers to discern, and they thought he was intoxicated, when he was not. He also had difficulty comprehending the businesses technology, and takes an inordinate amount of time, and gets angry when he doesn't get it as quickly as he was accustomed. There were instances where he struck the computer and threw parts/equipment in the store. The Veteran is constantly penalized for excessive breaking, hard breaking, driving excessive speeds, and rabbit starts, as a delivery driver. He sometimes has difficulty remembering how to operate devices. His friend thinks that his decline is beyond just age-related decline.

Analysis

The issue in this appeal is whether the Veteran's associated symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 50 percent prior to September 15, 2021.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's symptoms did not cause the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 50 percent prior to September 15, 2021. The Veteran's symptoms more closely approximated the symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating and resulted in a level of impairment that most closely approximated the level of impairment associated with a 30 percent rating.

VA treatment records, the September 2019 and November 2020 VA examinations, and the Veteran's lay statements show that the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress was manifested by symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating including a depressed mood and anxiety, and no symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating. The examiners opined that the Veteran's symptoms manifest as a mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough either to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication, or at most severe as an occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or; symptoms controlled by medication.

During the September 2019 and November 2020 VA examinations the examiners noted that the Veteran spends time with friends from church and the moose lodge. He indicated he also goes to a cigar bar twice a week. He noted some avoidance at times due to his mental health struggles. 

The Board finds that while the Veteran has noted some avoidance at times due to his mental health struggles his unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress manifested primarily as depression and anxiety. The Board finds the most probative evidence is the September 2019 and November 2020 VA examinations as the examiner thoroughly considered the Veteran's reported symptoms. The Board does not find that the Veteran's described any symptoms that would be construed under the 50 percent disability rating prior to September 15, 2021.

In short, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms resulted in the level of impairment required for a 50 percent rating.  The criteria for a 50 percent or higher rating are not met prior to September 15, 2021, and the appeal must be denied.

From September 15, 2021

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that a 70 percent disability rating is warranted for the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress. The Veteran's symptoms during the October 2021 VA examination included difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting. The October 2021 witness statement also noted symptoms that could be construed as impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence), as he stuck the computer and threw parts/equipment in the store.

Thus, the issue in this appeal is whether the Veteran's associated symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 100 percent.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's symptoms did not cause the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 100 percent.  The Veteran's symptoms more closely approximated the symptoms associated with a 70 percent rating, and resulted in a level of impairment that most closely approximated the level of impairment associated with a 70 percent rating. 

VA treatment records, the October 2021 VA examination, the Veteran's lay statements, and witness testimony show that the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress was manifested by symptoms associated with a 70 percent rating such as difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting, and as impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence), but no symptoms associated with a 100 percent rating,

The Board finds the level of impairment caused by the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximates the level associated with a 70 percent rating. The Board acknowledges that the October 2021 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms manifest as an occupational and social impairment of reduced reliability and productivity, which is consistent with a 50 percent disability rating. However, the Board finds that resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the totality of the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's symptoms manifest as an occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment. The probative evidence is against finding that the Veteran's symptoms manifest as a total occupational and social impairment.

The Board considered an effective date prior to September 15, 2021 for the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress, however the first factually ascertainable evidence was present during the October 2021 VA examination and October 2021 witness statement. The Veteran had a VA examination in November 2020 a year prior that demonstrated that the Veteran's only symptoms included depression and anxiety. Then in September 2021, the Veteran filed a claim for a TDIU, which the Board can construe as an indication that the Veteran's condition had worsened. Thus, the Board finds that September 15, 2021 is an appropriate date for an increased disability rating of 70 percent, but no earlier.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms resulted in the level of impairment required for a 100 percent rating. The criteria for a 100 percent or higher rating are not met and the appeal must be denied for a rating in excess of 70 percent from September 15, 2021.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal in the veteran's favor, the claim must be denied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

In this case, the Board does not find that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence for a disability rating in excess of 30 percent prior to September 15, 2021 for the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress, as the Veteran's symptoms manifested as an occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor the Board finds that the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress manifested as an occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, which is consistent with a 70 percent disability rating.

11. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 7, 2018 for TDIU

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date prior to September 15, 2021 for a TDIU. In the March 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted a TDIU based on his combined service-connected disabilities including cerebellar ataxia affecting right and lower extremities and unspecified depressive disorder.

A TDIU may be granted where a Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or higher, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or higher, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or higher. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. Id. Factors such as employment history, as well as educational and vocational attainments, are for consideration. Id. For VA purposes, the term "unemployability" is synonymous with an inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. VAOPGCPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2317 (1992). The word "substantially" suggests an intent to impart flexibility into a determination of overall employability, as opposed to requiring the appellant to prove that he is 100 percent unemployable. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

In 2019, the Court held that substantially gainful employment, in the context, contains economic and noneconomic components; the economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person, while the noneconomic component requires consideration of a veteran's ability to secure or follow that type of employment. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019). The Court also provided guidance as to the meaning of a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment, noting that attention must be given to: the veteran's occupational history, education, skill and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform occupational activities; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform occupational activities.  The Board's inquiry must focus on the current severity of the service-connected disabilities and whether they render the veteran unable to obtain or sustain substantially gainful employment, without consideration of the effect of non-service-connected disabilities. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 72-73 (2019); see Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).

In determining whether a TDIU is warranted, consideration may be given to a Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his or her age or to impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19. The determination of whether the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities is a factual determination rather than a medical question.

Therefore, responsibility for the ultimate determination of whether a veteran is capable of securing or following a substantially gainful occupation is placed on VA, not a medical examiner. Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.16; Floore v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 376, 381 (2013).

Throughout the appeal period, including ratings pursuant to this decision, the Veteran is service connected for unspecified depressive disorder at a 30 percent disability rating from May 8, 2018, and then 70 percent from September 15, 2021 cerebral ataxia affecting the right and left lower extremities at 20 percent each, cerebellar ataxia affecting right and left cranial nerves XII (facial) at 20 percent each, cerebellar ataxia affecting right and left cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal) at 20 percent each, cerebellar ataxia affecting right and left cranial nerves X (vagus) at 30 percent each, tinnitus at 10 percent, and right hearing loss at 0 percent.

In March 2021, the Veteran filed an application for increased compensation based on unemployability. The Veteran reported that his depressive disorder and cerebral ataxia affecting the right and left lower extremities prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation. He has worked part-time at an auto parts store since August 2015, and works 10-15 hours a week. He has earned $8400 in the past year. Prior to that he completed training in computer repair/maintenance in 2013. He completed four years of college. 

He stated that he has not been able to work full time for many years. His legs do not work like they used to, and he is unbalance and unstable when he walks, and cannot walk far. He sometimes uses a cane for balance. He falls down a lot, and has fallen at least 2-3 times while at work. He has missed a few days of work because he has fallen at night going to the bathroom. He also reported having a short temper. His shaking is misinterpreted by people, as he is weak or scared of them. His speech is also affected, and he feels he is not always communicating effectively. There are days he is not motivated, and it takes a lot to get out of his house. He does not feel like he could work a full-time job.  

The September 2019 peripheral nerve examiner noted that the Veteran's ataxia affecting the right and left lower extremities impact the Veteran's coordination and balance.

The September 2019 mental health examiner noted that the Veteran has balance problems, feels frustrated and depressed, and stays home because of people's mean comments. He has some anger and anxiety.

In October 2021, the Veteran submitted a witness statement. The Veteran's friend/co-worker/ fellow military veteran indicated that the Veteran had difficulty at times dealing with customers. The Veteran's cognitive and speech issues made it difficult for customers to discern, and they thought he was intoxicated, when he was not. He also had difficulty comprehending the businesses technology, and takes an inordinate amount of time, and gets angry when he doesn't get it as quickly as he was accustomed. There were instances where he stuck the computer and threw parts/equipment in the store. The Veteran is constantly penalized for excessive breaking, hard breaking, driving excessive speeds, and rabbit starts, as a delivery driver. He sometimes has difficulty remembering how to operate devices. His friend thinks that his decline is beyond just age-related decline.

The Board finds that the Veteran's combined serviced connected disabilities impacted the Veteran's ability to work throughout the appeal period, December 7, 2018. The Board finds that the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia disabilities including bilateral extremities/nerves and his unspecified depressive disorder preclude the Veteran from securing or following substantially gainful employment. The Board considered whether one specific disability alone precludes the Veteran from securing or following substantially gainful employment, and determined that it is the combination of all of the disabilities. 

Specifically, the Veteran's lower extremity disabilities impact the Veteran's ability to walk and stand for an extended amount of time, which alone could be mitigated by securing a job that would allow the Veteran to sit. However, this would not solve the Veteran's ability to communicate because of his nerve disabilities. Then all of the Veteran's cerebellar ataxia disabilities impact his mental health, as he is depressed and anxious because of his shaking, and speech. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus further impact the Veteran's ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful employment, but these disabilities alone do not preclude it. 

Therefore, the Board finds that the cumulative effect of all of the Veteran's service-connected cerebellar ataxia disabilities and unspecified depressive disorder disability preclude the Veteran from securing or following substantially gainful employment. The Board finds that the Veteran has had these disabilities throughout the appeal period, and an earlier effective date of December 7, 2018 is warranted for the Veteran's TDIU based on his combined service-connected disabilities. 

12. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 7, 2018 for Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status 

Basic eligibility for DEA benefits exists if a Veteran has a permanent, total service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501. A total disability may be assigned where the Veteran's service-connected disabilities are rated 100 percent disabling under the rating schedule, or if the Veteran is unemployable due to service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341. Permanence of total disability will be taken to exist when such impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(b). In this case, the Veteran had a permanent and total service-connected disability effective December 7, 2018, the date of the grant of TDIU, as the disabilities upon which that grant may reasonably be expected to continue throughout his life. Therefore, an earlier effective date for the award of basic eligibility to DEA benefits is granted from that date.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a separate disability rating for cerebellar ataxia affecting right lower extremity muscles is remanded.

2. Entitlement to a separate disability rating for cerebellar ataxia affecting left lower extremity muscles is remanded.

In October 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for peripheral nerves. In the remark section, the examiner noted that the Veteran would most likely benefit from a muscle DBQ to evaluate his service-connected condition of cerebellar ataxia affecting right and left lower extremity.

The Board finds a duty to assist error occurred prior to the March 2023 rating decision on appeal. Specifically, the RO did not secure a VA examination for the Veteran's muscles as was raised directly by the October 2021 VA examiner. Thus, the Board finds a remand is necessary to address this duty to assist error.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to provide the Veteran with an examination for his muscles related to his service-connected cerebellar ataxia affecting right and left lower extremity muscles. Provide the clinician with the Veteran's complete record, to include a copy of all remands, and the claims folder.
