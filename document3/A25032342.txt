REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability for purposes of accrued benefits is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a right foot disability for purposes of accrued benefits is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active military service from May 1985 to April 1989 with additional Reserve service.  He died in February 2018. The Appellant was properly substituted as claimant as noted in an April 24, 2019, letter.

A rating decision was issued under the legacy system in February 2016 and the Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement.  In August 2020, following the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) March 2020 remand, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) in August 2020.  Thereafter, the Veteran opted the claims into the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), by submitting an August 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, identifying the August 2020 SSOC.  Therefore, the August 2020 SSOC is the decision on appeal.  

In the August 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2020 SSOC. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the August 2020 SSOC, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for left and right foot disabilities, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability.

Entitlement to service connection for a right foot disability.

Most recently, this case was before the Board in March 2024, when it denied, among other issues, service connection for a right foot disability and a left foot disability.  The Veteran appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In an October 2024 Order, the Court granted a September 2024 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR), vacating the March 2024 denial of service connection for right and left foot disabilities.

In the September 2024 JMPR, the Veteran's attorney and VA's Office of General Counsel ("the parties") agreed that the July 2020 VA examiner's opinion did not consider the Veteran's credible lay statements in an August 2015 podiatry consultation and in a March 2016 insurance claim, both of record, that he first began having bunions during service.  Accordingly, remand is required to address the pre-decisional error of relying on an inadequate examination; a new opinion is necessary to address credible lay assertions of continuity of symptomatology since service, all of which were received prior to the rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 257 (2020).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum advisory medical opinion from an appropriate provider, on the likely etiology of the Veteran's diagnosed left and right foot disabilities. Copies of all pertinent records should be made available to the examiner for review. The examiner should answer the following:??? 

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's diagnosed left and right foot disabilities had its onset during his active duty service, is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease during his active duty service, to include as due to wearing military boots? Why or why not???? 

The examiner must consider and discuss as necessary the Veteran's lay statements, prior to his death, in an August 2015 podiatry consultation and in a March 2016 insurance claim that he began to get bunions during his active duty service, and had continued to get them after his separation.?

The examiner must explain the rationale for all opinions in detail, citing to supporting clinical data and/or medical literature, as appropriate. If an opinion cannot be provided, the examiner should indicate why.
