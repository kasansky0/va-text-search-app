FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) did not appeal a binding AOJ decision. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria have been met for the dismissal of the Veteran's appeal for an earlier effective date for basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA). 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104(a), 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.203, 3.2500(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1987 to May 1990.

On a June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the increased disability rating issues, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

In Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held the Board should not adjudicate an appeal until the time for the appellant to switch Board dockets has ended. This period ends either one year from the date the AOJ mailed notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). Here, the Board may proceed with adjudication because the period for the Veteran to request to switch dockets has passed.

The Veteran's prior representative, H.B., withdrew representation effective March 2025.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 17, 2017, for basic eligibility for DEA is dismissed.

In April 2021, the AOJ granted basic eligibility for DEA effective December 18, 2020. 

In May 2021, the AOJ issued a Rating Decision proposing to discontinue basic eligibility to DEA. Of the several notice letters sent to the Veteran that month, at least one did not discuss the issue of discontinuance of eligibility for DEA. 

The Veteran's former representative submitted multiple unsigned VA Forms 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), in June and July 2021, which VA did not accept.

In June 2021, the Veteran's former representative submitted a Higher-Level Review (HLR) request. 

Due to a procedural error regarding the May 2021 notice letter(s), the AOJ sent a letter regarding the proposed discontinuance of eligibility for DEA on August 4, 2021. 

In August 2021, the AOJ issued an HLR Rating Decision noting the criteria continued to be met for eligibility for DEA and the discontinuance would not be implemented. This occurred four days after the August 4, 2021, notice letter.

In October 2021, the Veteran's former representative submitted a signed VA Form 10182 noting that the Veteran still disagreed with the effective date assigned for basic eligibility for DEA and listed the date of decision disagreed with as August 2021. 

In April 2022, the AOJ again issued a Rating Decision noting that eligibility for DEA would be continued. This Rating Decision states that "[i]n our letter dated August 4, 2021, we proposed to discontinue your entitlement to Dependents' Educational Assistance." The same AOJ decision listed a "VA letter, proposal to reduce, dated August 24, 2021," as part of the evidence of record. This appears to be a reference to the August 4, 2021, letter. This Rating Decision nowhere notes that the August 2021 HLR Rating Decision already found discontinuance was not warranted. According to the corresponding Rating Decision codesheet, the "Associated Claim(s)" for this Rating Decision was "Predetermination - Rating Issue; 05/24/2021," the date of the initial proposed discontinuance. In other words, the April 2022 Rating Decision appears to have been issued without any acknowledgment of the existence of the August 2021 HLR Rating Decision. 

The Veteran submitted a June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), giving rise to this appeal.

In December 2023, the Board remanded the issue of an earlier effective date for eligibility for DEA.

In February 2025, the AOJ granted an earlier effective of July 17, 2017, for eligibility for DEA.

38 U.S.C § 7105(b) states "a notice of disagreement shall be filed within one year from the date of the issuance of notice of the decision of the agency of original jurisdiction[.]" See also 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52 ("[A] claimant, or his or her representative, must file a Notice of Disagreement with a determination by the agency of original jurisdiction within one year from the date that that agency mails notice of the determination to him or her. Otherwise, that determination will become final."); 20.203(b) ("[A] claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.").

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC or the Court) has held that the AOJ's decision to defer a ruling until a later date does not constitute a final decision by the agency, because all factual and legal questions relevant to the claim have been reserved for adjudication at a later date. Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011). In other words, a decision that merely refers to future action is not a determination by the AOJ and therefore the filing of a notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182 (NOD)) on such a decision, does not place the issue in appellate status.

Moreover, "the Board is unable to act on a 'matter' absent an appealable, binding [AOJ] decision that is adverse to the claimant." Sellers v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 265, 274 (2012); see also 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104(a).  

The primary issue with the appeal here is that, within the one year prior to June 2022, there had been no decision regarding the effective date for eligibility for DEA, only proposed discontinuance, which the AOJ did not implement, excepting the August 2021 HLR Decision, which the Veteran's former representative had already appealed. 

To the extent the August 2022 AOJ decision could be considered a decision by the AOJ as to the matter of eligibility to DEA, it was issued in error. The AOJ already stated that discontinuance was not warranted. After the August 2021 HLR Rating Decision, there was no factual or legal question remaining to be decided by the AOJ, as eligibility had been addressed in the August 2021 HLR Rating Decision, wherein the Veteran was informed that his DEA benefits would not be discontinued. 

To the extent the former representative or the Veteran attempted to use a June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) to appeal the initial April 2021 AOJ decision assigning an effective date for eligibility for DEA, such would have been untimely. The April 2021 notice letter regarding that AOJ decision was issued more than one year prior to the receipt of the June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). In addition, the appeal would be moot. The earliest claim giving rise to this appeal is for an increased disability rating for the service-connected back disability, received in April 2019, well after the current effective date of July 17, 2017, for eligibility for DEA.

Finally, even accepting that the August 2021 HLR Rating Decision, which noted the discontinuance of eligibility to DEA would not be implemented, could be considered an appealable decision, the appealable issue was already appealed in a prior VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and addressed in a December 2023 Board remand. 

A concurrent election is prohibited for a claim or issue that had already been elected into an administrative review option (by submitting a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, or appealing to the Board). 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). If the claimant had already filed a review option, they may not seek a review under a different review opinion while the original review election remains pending. Id. The Court has held that a claimant may file more than one administrative review request within one year of an initial agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on a claim, provided that such an administrative review request is not pending concurrently with another administrative review request. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). 

It follows that the Veteran's June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) could not appeal the August 2021 HLR Rating Decision regarding DEA, as the Veteran already filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) appealing that issue in October 2021 and it was pending from October 2021 to December 2023, when the Board issued a remand. Therefore, there being no proper appealable issue, the appeal must be dismissed.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with intervertebral disc syndrome is remanded; 2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent prior to April 5, 2022, for right lower extremity radiculopathy is remanded; 3. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent after April 5, 2022, for right lower extremity radiculopathy is remanded; 4. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent prior to April 5, 2022, for left lower extremity radiculopathy is remanded; & 5. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent after April 5, 2022, for left lower extremity radiculopathy is remanded.

As an initial matter, as noted in a December 2023 Board remand:

Prior to the August 2021 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran identified relevant outstanding federal records, specifically the Veteran submitted a notice that he was entitled to disability benefits by the Social Security Administration (SSA).  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran submitted some records from SSA; however, these were not submitted in a timely manner, and it is unclear if they are the complete records as they consist of a single determination and a single examination.

The same analysis regarding the failure to obtain SSA records prior to the August 2021 Rating Decision also applies to the April 2022 Rating Decision. Indeed, as part of a December 2021 Board hearing, the Veteran specifically noted receiving SSA disability benefits for his back. A failure in obtaining SSA records is a failure in the duty to assist that occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal.  Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1323 (2010).

For the lumbar spine disability, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC or the Court) held in Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (March 12, 2025), that the Board must discount beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity when rating musculoskeletal disabilities. See also Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012) ("[T]he Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria.").

Multiple VA examination reports, including those dated in April 2022 and May 2021, for degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with intervertebral disc syndrome note that the Veteran took medication, specifically gabapentin, diclofenac, cyclobenzaprine, and methocarbamol.

The AOJ rated the Veteran's disability at 40 percent disabling, and a 50 percent disability rating requires "[u]nfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine." See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71(a), General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (also noting that "[u]nfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine" warrants a 100 percent disability rating). The Court in Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021) held that consideration of "functional equivalence" to ankylosis should be considered even if actual ankylosis is not present. Here, therefore, a VA examination is necessary as to whether (absent medication effects) the Veteran would have the "functional equivalence" to ankylosis. 

Radiculopathy is not rated under the criteria for musculoskeletal disability ratings, but under criteria in the section entitled "Neurological Conditions and Convulsive Disorders." However, the same logic of Jones and Ingram apply to the radiculopathy disability ratings as the disability ratings criteria do not contain any mention of the ameliorative effects of medication. At least one recent nonprecedential decision of the Court has already required that Ingram applies to the section entitled "Neurological Conditions and Convulsive Disorders." See Bennett v. Collins, No. 23-6142, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 365 (March 21, 2025) (instructing the Board to address Ingram for rating service-connected tension headaches, rated as migraines). 

A May 2021 VA examination report notes that the Veteran took gabapentin and amitriptyline for the radiculopathy disabilities. Given the above, an additional VA examination is necessary regarding the effects of medication.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for examinations by appropriate clinician(s) to determine the severity of the service-connected (1) degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with intervertebral disc syndrome, (2) right lower extremity radiculopathy, and (3) left lower extremity radiculopathy. 

The examiner(s) should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the disability ratings criteria.  

The examiner(s) should discount the beneficial effects of medications taken for each disability and evaluate the baseline severity (i.e., the severity of the disability absent the beneficial effects of medication). The Veteran's medication includes gabapentin, diclofenac, cyclobenzaprine, and methocarbamol for his back, and gabapentin and amitriptyline for his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.

A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed. If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

2. Readjudicate the claim, to include consideration of the SSA records obtained after the April 2022 Rating Decision.
