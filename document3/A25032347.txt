ORDER

Eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees based on the June 2023 grant of past-due benefits is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

A VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) was not received within 60 days from the date of mailing of the notification of the July 2023 fee decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees based on the June 2023 grant of past-due benefits have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, the appellant in this contested claim, served on active duty from July 1994 to July 1998. The contested claimant is the Veteran's former attorney.

The fee decision on appeal was issued in July 2023 and constitutes an initial decision of the issue of attorney fees; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. On his October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 fee decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

In accordance with contested claims procedures, a redacted copy of the Veteran's substantive appeal was sent to the contesting claimant in January 2024.  Furthermore, contested claims docketing letters were sent to the appellant and the contesting claimant in January 2024 and February 2024.

Entitlement to eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the June 2023 Rating Decision

By way of procedural background, the contesting claimant took on representation of the Veteran via an April 2019 VA Form 21-22a and valid Fee Agreement ("April 2019 Fee Agreement").  The April 2019 Fee Agreement specified that the Veteran retained the contesting claimant in connection with the January 2019 Rating Decision which denied finding clear and unmistakable evidence (CUE) in a prior rating decision.  Subsequently, service connection for unspecified personality disorder, an acquired psychiatric disorder, was denied in an April 2019 Rating Decision.  

In September 2022, the Veteran, through the appellant as counsel, filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, as a result of which the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denied service connection for unspecified personality disorder, major depressive disorder, and generalized personality disorder.  The Veteran, in January 2023, filed another VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application.  A June 2023 Rating Decision granted service connection for major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms, an acquired psychiatric disorder, assigning a rating of 70 percent and an effective date of January 8, 2023, as well as eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits.  In a subsequent June 26, 2023 Rating Decision, the RO granted an effective date of September 2, 2022 for this benefit.  

In a July 6, 2023 fee decision, the RO found that all the criteria for direct payment of fees stemming from the June 26, 2023 Rating Decision had been met, and that fees would be directly paid to the contesting claimant. The fee decision was mailed to both the Veteran and the contesting claimant and instructed the parties that they had 60 days from the date of the letter to appeal the decision. The Veteran submitted an VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal on October 25, 2023.

For the following reasons, the Board finds that the appellant did not file a timely NOD as to the July 2023 fee decision.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.402, a claimant has 60 days from the date of mailing of the notification of the fee determination to file a NOD or the determination becomes final. Here, the fee decision was issued on July 6, 2023. As previously discussed, the notice provided that if one of the parties did not agree with this contested claim decision, they had 60 days from the date of the letter to seek further review. The notice further enclosed additional information regarding the right to appeal and how the appeal must be filed. The date of mailing of the letter of notification is presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether a Notice of Disagreement has been timely filed. The appellant did not file his VA Form 10182 until October 25, 2023, which was more than 60 days after the date of mailing the July 6, 2023 fee decision.

The Board herein notes that in his October 25, 2023 appeal, the Veteran cites a September 15, 2023 fee decision awarding fees for the September 2023 grant of a motion seeking revision of a prior rating decision awarding a noncompensable rating for pes planus, awarding an initial 30 percent rating for pes planus instead.  However, in that same appeal, the Veteran states that he is disputing the $1098.60 paid to the contesting claimant that he asserts was paid in error. He bases this on his April 2019 Fee Agreement specifically mentioning the January 2019 Rating Decision as the subject of his agreement with the contesting claimant.  Regardless of the merit of his claim, because he did not timely appeal the July 2023 fee decision awarding benefits stemming from the June 2023 Rating Decision, the Board is without jurisdiction to adjudicate this claim. 

In sum, as the October 2023 VA Form 10182 was not timely as to the July 2023 fee decision, the Board finds that the appeal was incorrectly docketed for review, and the appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c).
