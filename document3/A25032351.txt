ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee strains as secondary to right hip strain and compression arthralgia is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's tinnitus is at least as likely as not related to her active service noise exposure.

2. The evidence weighs persuasively against the claim for service connection for bilateral knee strain as secondary to right hip strain and compression arthralgia.

3. The Veteran's July 18, 2016; August 5, 2016; and from June 14, 2017, to June 16, 2017, ADT periods were not active service within the meaning of applicable statutes and regulations. 

4. The Veteran's bilateral knee strains were not incurred in or aggravated by her period of ADT. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee strains have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 106, 1101, 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.6, 3.102, 3.303, 3.306.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty for training (ADT) in the United States Army Reserve from September 2009 to January 2010. That period of ADT is considered active duty for compensation purposes as the Regional Office (RO) granted service connection for disabilities based on that period of service. See 38 U.S.C. § 101(24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a). 

The Veteran also served on ADT on July 18, 2016; August 5, 2016; and from June 14, 2017, to June 16, 2017. Service connection for a disability during this period of ADT has not been awarded, and thus, it is not established that the Veteran has been disabled due to a disease incurred in the line of duty during this period of ADT. Therefore, veteran status has not been established for this period of ADT service. See Mercado-Martinez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 415, 419 (1998).

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304. Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Generally, establishing service connection requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999). Additionally, a showing of continuity of symptoms from separation to the present is a factor to be considered in assessing service connection claims.

In order to establish status as a Veteran based upon a period of ADT, a claimant must establish that he was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (a). The fact that a claimant has established status as a Veteran for purposes of other periods of service does not obviate the need for him to establish that he also is a Veteran for purposes of the period of ADT if his claim for VA benefits is premised on the period of ADT. Mercado-Martinez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 415, 419 (1998).

Generally, no presumptions (including the presumptions of soundness, aggravation, or for presumptive diseases) attach to periods of ADT and IDT unless "veteran" status is attained during those periods. Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 470 (1995).

For appellants who have achieved "veteran" status through a prior period of active service and now claim a disability incurred only during a later period of ADT, the presumption of soundness applies only when the veteran has been "examined, accepted, and enrolled for service" and where that examination revealed no "defects, infirmities, or disorders." Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 45-46 (2010).

Disabilities incurred in or due to civilian periods cannot be due to service, but they may be aggravated by service. For period of ADT to satisfy the criteria of active service based on aggravation of a preexisting disability, the disability must worsen during service and the worsening must be due to the ADT period. In such cases, a claimant seeking benefits based on aggravation of an injury or disease during active duty for training has the burden of demonstrating, by approximate balance, both aggravation elements. See Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 174-75. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a).

Tinnitus

Tinnitus is a condition capable of lay observation, and the Veteran's reports of in-service occurrence are credible. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 70 (2002). Tinnitus is also considered an "organic disease of the nervous system" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a). Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 275-75 (2015). Therefore, the theory of continuity of symptomatology is applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a), (b); 

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus that she contends is due to in-service hazardous noise exposure. See January 2019 and October 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ. She states she was exposed to noise trauma during basic training to include weaponry, such as rifles and machine guns, routinely without ear protection, and now she has recurrent tinnitus. See February 2023 statement in support of the claim.

The AOJ favorably found the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus, per the April 2023 VA examination.  

Service treatment records are unremarkable for complaint, treatment, or diagnosis of tinnitus. 

In February 2019, the Veteran underwent a VA tinnitus examination. The clinician found no nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and her in-service noise exposure because the Veteran reported an onset of tinnitus two years prior to the examination, which is several years post-separation. 

A February 2023 private medical opinion found a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and military service. The examiner explained that the Veteran's in-service military occupational specialty (MOS) as a logistics specialist had a moderate probability of noise exposure per the Duty MOS noise exposure listing. That, and her non-MOS noise exposure, concede acoustic trauma. The examiner cited medical literature indicating that an audiogram could present as normal for months/years later following acoustic trauma and then years later, tinnitus could develop, i.e. delayed onset.

In April 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA tinnitus examination. The clinician found no nexus, stating that the Veteran reported tinnitus in 2011, which is not during active duty. Additionally, tinnitus was not listed on hearing conversation records and there were no changes or shifts in hearing thresholds during military service to include both active and reserve time. 

A July 2023 private medical opinion found a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and military service. The examiner explained that the Veteran's MOS and non-MOS noise exposures should concede her acoustic trauma. The examiner cited medical literature, one of which indicated a possible link between acoustic trauma and tinnitus, even years after the actual acoustic trauma, i.e. delayed onset. 

The February 2019 and April 2023 VA medical opinions are inadequate for adjudication because the examiners did not consider delayed onset of tinnitus. Indeed, VA Training Letter 10-02 states that "[t]he onset [of tinnitus] may be gradual or sudden, and individuals are often unable to identify when tinnitus began. Tinnitus can be triggered months or years after an underlying cause (such as hearing loss) occurs. Therefore, delayed-onset tinnitus must be considered." As such, the February 2019 and April 2023 VA medical opinions are accorded minimal probative value against the claim. Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).

Instead, the Board affords substantial probative weight to the February 2023 and July 2023 private medical opinions as the examiners adequately considered the Veteran's lay statements, reviewed the medical records, and provided adequate medical opinions and cited medical literature in support of the opinions. Id. 

In consideration of the available medical and lay evidence of record, and with resolution of reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that a nexus is established between the Veteran's active service noise exposure and current tinnitus. As such, service connection for tinnitus is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021). 

Bilateral Knee Strain

The Veteran contends that her current bilateral knee strain disability began in active military service due to a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in 2012, and that her symptoms have since continued. See March 2023 Statement in Support of Claim; see also, August 2023 VA examination. 

While the Veteran has a current diagnosis of bilateral knee strain, the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that this condition worsened during a period of ADT. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363. 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (a), 3.304.

Favorable findings from the September 2023 rating decision on appeal concede (1) the Veteran has a current diagnosis of left and right knee strains, (2) service treatment records show complaints of bilateral knee pain, and (3) the Veteran is service connected for bilateral hip strain. See September 2023 rating decision. 

The Veteran's DD Form 214 documents active service from September 2009 to January 2010 in the Army/United States Army Reserve. Documentation from the Defense Personnel Records Information Retrieval System (DPRIS) includes Records of Individual Performance of Reserve Duty Training, listing ADT from June 14, 2017, to June 16, 2017; and on July 18, 2016, and August 5, 2016. See August 21, 2016, and June 16, 2017, DA Forms 1380. For the period from June 14, 2017, the record shows duties performed included "supply support"; for the periods of July 18, 2016, and August 5, 2016, duties performed included "dental consultation exam" and "surgical removal of erupted tooth/ deep sedation/ general anesthesia," respectively. 

The Veteran accordingly served a period of ADT from September 2009 to January 2010 that is considered active duty for compensation purposes. She also had ADT service on July 18, 2016; August 5, 2016; and from June 14, 2017, to June 16, 2017, that has not established veteran status. 

The service treatment records do not document bilateral knee injury during the Veteran's active duty from September 2009 to January 2010, or on July 18, 2016; August 5, 2016; and from June 14, 2017, to June 16, 2017; furthermore, the records do not reveal treatment received on those dates for a bilateral knee injury. 

Service treatment records show the Veteran was involved in an accident in January 2012. In February 2012, the Veteran sought medical treatment for neck pain, shoulder pain, lower back pain, tiredness, soreness, and tightness as due to the MVA. In July 2013, she sought medical treatment in order to have a civilian profile entered due to knee pain, secondary to the January 2012 MVA.

Reserve personnel records show that the Veteran was placed on a physical profile in April 2013 due to knee pain.

A March 2015 service treatment record report notes the Veteran's complaints of constant bilateral knee pain that had worsened over time. She reported that knee pain worsened with prolonged standing and squatting. The Veteran's permanent profile was continued. 

Service treatment records also indicate the Veteran was involved in another accident in 2016. See July 14, 2017, Service treatment record, Chiropractic Letter. The Veteran sought treatment from a chiropractor from November 18, 2016, to January 24, 2017, and was placed on continued permanent profile. See also, August 25, 2017, Service treatment record, physical profile record. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for knee and lower leg conditions in August 2023. A diagnosis of bilateral knee strains was confirmed. The Veteran reported the onset of her knee conditions in 2012; she reported seeking medical care for bilateral knee pain and reported being placed on a temporary profile while in service. She denied any surgeries, hospitalizations, or emergency room visits related to the condition. The examiner opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's bilateral knee strains incurred in or was caused by active service because service treatment records note the Veteran's MVA occurred in January 2012, which is post-discharge from active duty. 

The Veteran's statements made regarding the onset and progression of her bilateral knee pain are contemporaneous with the medical evidence and are therefore, credible. Therefore, the probative evidence does not show an onset or worsening of the Veteran's bilateral knee pain during active service from September 2009 to January 2010, or her ADT service on July 18, 2016; August 5, 2016; and from June 14, 2017, to June 16, 2017. 

Indeed, the probative evidence demonstrates the Veteran's complaints reflect bilateral knee pain that onset consistently in January 2012 as due to an accident. In March 2015, she reported worsened bilateral knee pain. In this regard, the Veteran was neither on active service nor ADT. 

While the service treatment records document that she was involved in another accident in 2016, the evidence does not show the event occurred during a period of active service or ADT. Furthermore, the evidence does not include a line of duty report for either accident. 

The evidence indicates the Veteran was on an extended permanent profile due to her bilateral knee pain. However, the evidence does not reveal complaints or treatment suggesting worsened bilateral knee pain during service and as due to the ADT period. 

The Veteran was provided a VA examination in August 2023. The examiner provided no adequate rationale and instead, merely stated that a nexus is not established because the Veteran's injuries occurred post-discharge from active duty. While evidence exists of a current diagnosis, the VA's duty to assist was not triggered to provide a medical opinion as the Veteran did not establish that her disability worsened during her active service or ADT periods. Therefore, the ADT periods are not active service. ADT must be determined to be active service before a basic entitlement to disability compensation applies.

Additionally, the September 2023 rating decision also included a claim of secondary service connection, finding that the evidence does not show a nexus between the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hip disability and the Veteran's current bilateral knee strains. The Board notes that medical opinion has not been obtained regarding secondary service connection. However, neither the Veteran, nor the evidence suggests a link between the service-connected bilateral hip condition and the Veteran's diagnosed bilateral knee strains. In other words, there is no indication to suggest that these conditions are related. Therefore, the Board finds that VA did not have duty to assist in obtaining this medical opinion. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); see also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010). 

In sum, the probative evidence weighs persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee strain disability is not warranted.
