ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 20, 2019 for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to military sexual trauma (MST) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran initially filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD on August 29, 2017.  The AOJ denied the original claim in a December 2017 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision by filing a notice of disagreement within the one-year appeal period.  As such, this decision became final.

2. The Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim on March 20, 2019, followed by a claim for PTSD in a VA Form 21-526EZ in October 2019 and a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application for entitlement to service connection for PTSD in November 2019.  

3. In a January 2020 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST with an evaluation of 100 percent effective November 5, 2019.

4. The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, in February 2020, seeking an earlier effective date for entitlement to service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST.  The AOJ denied the claim in a March 2020 rating decision.

5. The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, seeking an earlier effective date for PTSD in November 2022.  In a November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted an earlier effective date of March 20, 2019 for entitlement to service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST.

6. The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, in January 2023, seeking an earlier effective date for entitlement to service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST.  The claim was denied in the January 2023 rating decision on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to March 20, 2019 for the award of service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.151, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1979 to December 1979.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)'s decision on their claim to seek review.  This decision has been written consistent with the AMA framework.

Applicable Evidentiary Window

The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, seeking an earlier effective date for PTSD in November 2022.  In a November 28, 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted an earlier effective date of March 20, 2019 for entitlement to service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST.  In January 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review seeking increased ratings for his bilateral knee conditions.  In the January 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied an effective date prior to March 20, 2019 for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST.

The Veteran appealed the January 2023 rating decision by filing a February 2023 VA Form 10182, in which he requested a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.  A Board hearing was scheduled for October 28, 2024.  In correspondence received on July 24, 2024, the Veteran requested to cancel the scheduled Board hearing.  As such, the Board's decision will be based on a review of evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's November 28, 2022 rating decision, and evidence submitted by the Veteran or Veteran's representative within 90 days following the receipt of the withdrawal, which is October 22, 2024.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).

If additional evidence was submitted between the date of the AOJ decision and the date the hearing request was withdrawn, the Board will not consider it unless it is resubmitted during the 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal request.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 20, 2019 for service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST is denied.

As noted above, the Veteran initially filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD on August 29, 2017.  The AOJ denied the original claim in a December 2017 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision by filing a notice of disagreement within the one-year appeal period.  As such, this decision became final.

The Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim on March 20, 2019, followed by a claim for PTSD in a VA Form 21-526EZ in October 2019 and a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application for entitlement to service connection for PTSD in November 2019.  

In a January 2020 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST with an evaluation of 100 percent effective November 5, 2019.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, in February 2020, seeking an earlier effective date for entitlement to service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST.  The AOJ denied the claim in a March 2020 rating decision.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, seeking an earlier effective date for PTSD in November 2022.  In a November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted an earlier effective date of March 20, 2019 for entitlement to service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date prior to March 20, 2019.  Specifically, he contends that the effective date should be the date of his assault in service in December 1979.

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  However, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be the day following separation from active service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).  In this case, the Veteran did not file his original claim until August 29, 2017, greater than one year after his service.

Prior to February 19, 2019 (the effective date of AMA), a grant of service connection on the basis of the receipt of new and material evidence following a final prior disallowance is the date of receipt of the application to reopen, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r).  In this case, the Veteran filed his intent to reopen his claim on March 20, 2019.  As such, an effective date of March 20, 2019 has been granted.

A Veteran can only establish an earlier effective date following a final rating decision through the mechanism of demonstrating clear and unmistakable (CUE) in that rating action.  The Veteran has not alleged CUE in the December 2017 final rating decision.  See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003).

Lastly, the Board notes that under the AMA, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h) provides that the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision. However, the AMA and its provisions regarding continuous pursuit became effective on February 19, 2019.  Thus, this provision is not applicable to the Veteran's final prior denial in December 2017.  Further, the Veteran did not continuously pursue his claim by filing a supplemental claim, request for higher-level review, or notice of disagreement within one year of the December 2017 rating decision.

As such, the date of the Veteran's March 20, 2019 intent to file a claim is the appropriate effective date for service connection for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and cocaine use disorder in early full remission due to MST.  As the AOJ has already assigned the earliest possible effective date provided by law, an effective date prior to March 20, 2019 is not warranted.
