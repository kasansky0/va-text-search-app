DOCKET NO. 250227-522174
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 1, 2017 for the award of Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) based on service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is granted, subject to controlling regulations governing the payment of monetary awards.  

FINDING OF FACT

The appellant communicated an intent to file a claim for survivor's benefits, to include a claim for DIC, on March 21, 2017 within one year of the Veteran's post-separation service-connected death in March 2017.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the appellant, the criteria for an effective date of March 1, 2017 for the award of DIC based on service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1310, 5110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.312, 3.400, 3.2500.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1954 to November 1957.  The Veteran died in March 2017 and the appellant is his surviving spouse.  

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2025 decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which denied an effective date earlier than June 23, 2023 for an awarded DIC based on service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  Previously, the RO had granted service connection for cause of death in a January 2024 decision.  The appellant subsequently filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review in November 2024, which led to the February 2025 decision.  

In the February 2025 decision on appeal before the Board, the RO considered the evidence of record at the time of the previous decision that granted service connection for cause of death.  

The same month, the appellant filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing the February 2025 decision, and she chose the Board's Direct Review docket.  

Due to her docket review choice, the Board can only consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying January 2024 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the January 2024 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, the Board notes that the decision herein is considered a full grant of the benefits sought by the appellant in this case.  

Veterans Benefits Law

Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015 to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  The amendments, however, are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.  

Under the former legal authority, any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA, from a veteran or his representative, may be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If received within one year from the date it was sent to the Veteran, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (in effect prior to March 24, 2015).  

There is no set form that an informal written claim must take.  All that is required is that the communication indicates an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, and identify the benefits sought.  Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (1999).  

Under the revised regulations, although informal claims are no longer recognized, a claimant may submit an Intent to File a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the Intent to File a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within one year of receipt of the Intent to File a claim.  An Intent to File a claim must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension), but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1310, DIC is paid to a surviving spouse of a qualifying veteran who died from a service-connected disability.  See Darby v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 243, 245 (1997).  The death of a Veteran will be considered as having been due to a service-connected disability when the evidence establishes that such disability was either the principal or a contributory cause of death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(a).  The service-connected disability is considered the principal cause of death when such disability, either singly or jointly with another condition, was the immediate or underlying cause of death or was etiologically related to the cause of death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(b).  

Where a grant of death compensation or DIC is made on the basis of a Veteran's service-connected death after separation from service, the effective date will be the first day of the month in which the Veteran's death occurred, if the claim is received within 1 year from the date of death; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(c)(2).  

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the notice of a decision was issued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, continuous pursuit can be established by filing a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, or requesting an appeal to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1).  

An earlier effective date for the award of DIC.  

In this case, the Board finds, for the following reasons, that an effective date of March 1, 2017 for the award of DIC based on service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is warranted.  

The Veteran died in March 2017.  The January 2024 rating decision granted service connection for his cause of death as related to his asbestos exposure in military service.  

The claims file reflects that VA was faxed a copy of the Veteran's DD 214 from a funeral home on March 5, 2017.  

On March 13, 2017, VA sent a letter to the "estate of" the Veteran informing the recipient that the surviving spouse of a Veteran is entitled to benefits, such as a month of death payment, burial payments, DIC, pension, education, home loan, health care, and life insurance.  Under the month of death benefit section, this VA letter stated that "the surviving spouse must call" to provide answers to a list of questions pertaining to identities, how to contact, and marriage information.  Two hyperlinks were also provided for more information regarding entitlement to additional benefits.  

A record of telephone contact is documented from March 21, 2017, showing that "the spouse called to establish surviving spouse information per the March 13, 2017 [letter]."  A May 2017 letter to the appellant indicated VA had received her claim, which was not specified.  Thereafter, the other VA documents from 2017 until 2023 only pertain to burial and funeral expenses.  It is not apparent that any blank claim form application was provided or any other duty to assist measures had been undertaken.  

In June 2023, the appellant submitted a VA 21-534EZ Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation or Death Pension by a Surviving Spouse or Child, writing clearly that she was seeking any and all survivor's benefits she was eligible for.  In her November 2024 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review regarding the DIC effective date, the appellant argued that when her husband had died, she had spoken with VA over the phone (an event which is supported by the record as described above), but that essentially the VA professionals indicated to her they did not believe she was eligible for further benefits.  While the Board cannot review the appellant's post-January 2024 statement as evidence to fact find, the Board notes that no official determination or denial of benefits by VA had been associated with the claims file.  

However, there is the March 21, 2017 communication from this unrepresented widow appellant, documented when she provided the detailed information to VA in response to the March 13, 2017 VA letter instructing a surviving spouse to provide the information for seeking survivor's benefits.

?

As her previous March 2017 attempt to claim survivor's benefits remained unadjudicated, the Board has determined that the evidence is at least approximately evenly balanced as to whether the previous March 2017 claim was pending at the time of the January 2024 decision awarding service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  Also, this claim was received within one year of the Veteran's death on March 4, 2017.  

As the reasonable doubt created by the approximate balance in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the appellant, the proper effective date for the award of DIC based on service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is March 1, 2017 (the first day of the month in which the Veteran's death occurred).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(c)(2).  This is the earliest effective date allowable based on the relevant law and regulation pertaining to DIC claims; the appeal is granted in full.
