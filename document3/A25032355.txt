REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable rating for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).    In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.   However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to a compensable rating for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

Once VA provides an examination or obtains a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  With respect to the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an increased disability rating for GERD, the Board finds that the June 2023 examination for the condition was inadequate.  In it, the examiner noted the Veteran's continuous use of medication as part of his treatment plan; however, though the applicable rating criteria does not contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication use, the examiner did not address the Veteran's functional limitations due to GERD notwithstanding relief provided by medication.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012); see also McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267 (2016).  Additionally, the examiner, via check box, indicated that the Veteran does not have substernal, arm, or shoulder pain.  But in his statement in support of his claim, the Veteran contended that he experiences chest pain, arm pain, and shoulder pain during flare-ups.   Accordingly, remand for an addendum opinion is required.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Return the claims file to the VA examiner who conducted the June 12, 2023 Esophageal Condition C&P Examination, if available.  If that examiner is not available, send the claims file to another examiner to address the following:

Provide a retrospective opinion providing a full description of the Veteran's functional limitations due to his GERD and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.  After reviewing the record, to include the Veteran's lay statements, describe the extent to which the Veteran's medications for GERD ameliorate the symptoms of his disability.  In other words, provide a full description of functional limitations should the Veteran fail to take his medication (e.g., increased epigastric distress, vomiting, or weight loss).

A complete rationale for the examiner's opinions should be provided, citing to specific evidence of record, as necessary.  Citation to relevant peer reviewed medical literature reviewed in rendering the opinion would be of considerable assistance to the Board.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner should provide an explanation as to why this is so.
