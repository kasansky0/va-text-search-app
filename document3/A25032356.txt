ISSUE

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 3, 2022, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU).

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 3, 2022, for entitlement to TDIU is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On November 25, 2020 the Veteran filed a claim in part for service connection for interstitial cystitis and migraine headaches. A January 27, 2021 rating decision granted service connection for both at 40 and 30 percent disabling respectively effective August 29, 2020, the date following separation from service. The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement with the rating assigned.  

2. A September 14, 2021 rating decision granted service connection for an insomnia disorder rated at 30 percent disabling effective August 29, 2020. The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement with the rating assigned.  

3. On October 3, 2022, the Veteran filed VA 21-526EZ, claiming service connection for PTSD, anxiety, and mental disorders generally.

4. On June 12, 2023, the Veteran filed VA 21-8940, an application for increased compensation based on unemployability claiming her service-connected insomnia, migraines, and interstitial cystitis prevent her from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation. 

5. A September 6, 2023 rating decision, incorporating the PTSD and other mental disorders claims together, recharacterized the Veteran's service-connected insomnia to PTSD and granted an increased 70 percent disability rating for PTSD effective October 3, 2022, the date of receipt of the claim of service connection for PTSD.

6. It was not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevented her from securing and following "substantially gainful employment" consistent with her education and occupational experience prior to October 3, 2022, which is within the one year preceding the date of receipt of the June 2023 VA 21-8940 application for increased compensation based on unemployability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than October 3, 2022, for entitlement to TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.340, 3.4, 4.16, 4.18.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2013 to December 2014, and from August 2017 to August 2020.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO). The Veteran timely appealed by submitting a June 2024 VA Form 10182 and requested the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

As a preliminary matter, the Veteran appealed the February 2024 grant of TDIU, effective October 3, 2022. In her June 2024 VA Form 10182, she listed the area of disagreement as "disability evaluation." As a grant of TDIU effectively grants a maximum combined disability rating of 100 percent, the Board infers the Veteran is disputing the effective date of the grant of the TDIU evaluation as no higher rating percentage can be awarded.

Lastly, the Board notes that the June 2024 VA Form 10182 included an appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for tinnitus which was last denied by a January 2023 rating decision. A BVA untimely appeal letter was sent to the Veteran on July 5, 2024 informing her that the issue of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus was untimely and that the Board could not docket that issue. As that issue was not docketed, this decision will not address it. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 3, 2022, for the grant of TDIU is denied.

The Veteran contends she is entitled to an effective date for the grant of TDIU earlier than October 3, 2022. 

Beginning with the relevant procedural history, the Veteran filed a November 25, 2020 VA 21-526EZ claiming, in part, service connection for interstitial cystitis and migraine headaches. A January 27, 2021 rating decision granted service connection for both at 40 and 30 percent disabling respectively effective August 29, 2020, the date following separation from service. Next, the Veteran filed a July 2021 VA 21-526EZ claiming, in part, service connection for sleep disturbances. A September 14, 2021 rating decision granted this claim as insomnia disorder at 30 percent disabling effective August 29, 2020. The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement with the rating assigned.  

The Veteran then filed an October 3, 2022 VA 21-526EZ claiming service connection for PTSD, anxiety, and mental disorders generally. She then filed a June 12, 2023 VA 21-8940 application for increased compensation based on unemployability claiming her service-connected insomnia, migraines, and interstitial cystitis prevent her from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation. A September 6, 2023 rating decision, incorporating the PTSD and other mental disorders claims together, recharacterized the Veteran's service-connected insomnia to PTSD and granted an increased 70 percent disability rating for PTSD effective October 3, 2022, the date of receipt of the claim. Lastly, the February 1, 2024 rating decision currently on appeal then granted TDIU effective October 3, 2022, the date the Veteran met the criteria for a grant of TDIU within one year prior to the receipt of the VA 21-8940. 

A request for a TDIU (whether expressly raised or implied by the record) is not a separate claim for benefits, but rather an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating, either as part of the initial adjudication of a claim or as part of a claim for an increased rating. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Once the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is raised, it is "part of the claim for benefits for the underlying disability." Id. Here, TDIU was expressly raised by the June 12, 2023 VA 21-8940 in connection with the Veteran's service-connected migraines, interstitial cystitis, and insomnia. Relevantly, the Veteran filed a claim for PTSD and other psychiatric issues, not including insomnia, on October 3, 2022 as noted above, which was later granted as an increased 70 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD which had previously been characterized as insomnia, effective October 3, 2022. 

Generally, the effective date for an award of service connection and disability compensation is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, for an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final allowance, or a claim for an increase, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Claimants may also submit an intent to file a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). If VA receives a complete application form for the benefit sought within one year of receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. Id. Here, however, VA did not receive any notice of intent to file during the evidentiary window applicable to this decision.

If a claim is continuously pursued, it will generally be considered filed as of the date the first claim was received in the continuously pursued chain, instead of the date of the most recent request for review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). A claim is considered continuously pursued by filing a proper administrative review option within one year of a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). 

As an initial matter, it is necessary to identify that the Veteran did not continuously pursue the earlier rating decisions granting service connection for insomnia, migraines, or interstitial cystitis. A January 27, 2021 rating decision granted service connection for both and no review options were filed related to those claims until the June 12, 2023 VA 21-8940, well beyond one year from the January 2021 rating decision. A September 14, 2021 rating decision granted service connection for insomnia, and the claim was not pursued again until the October 3, 2022 21-526EZ for PTSD, which beyond one year from the September 14, 2021 rating decision. The Board also notes that, procedurally, a 21-526EZ represents a new initial claim for benefits and is not identified as one of the administrative review options to continuously pursue an issue. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). The appropriate review options are a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995), a request for a higher-level review (VA Form 20-0996), or appeal to the Board (VA Form 10182). Therefore, the claims for insomnia, migraines, and interstitial cystitis which serve as the underlying basis for the TDIU claim were not continuously pursued. Consequently, although the June 2023 TDIU claim is treated as a claim for an increased rating for the Veteran's insomnia, migraines, and interstitial cystitis, the effective date unfortunately cannot reach back to the initial effective date granted for those disabilities.

For effective date purposes, a claim for a TDIU is generally considered a claim for an increased rating. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007); Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000). Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of an increased evaluation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefore. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An exception to this general rule applies where evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of the claim for increased compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

The February 2024 rating decision on appeal granted TDIU effective October 3, 2022, finding that the Veteran met the criteria for the grant of a TDIU at that date which was within a year of receipt of the Veteran's VA 21-8940. This represents a favorable finding. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by favorable findings unless they are rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence. 38?C.F.R. §§?3.104(c); 20.801(a). After a thorough review of the Veteran's electronic claim file, the Board concludes that such clear and unmistakable evidence does not exist. Therefore, the Board need only consider whether the evidence suggests the Veteran met the criteria for the grant of a TDIU prior to October 3, 2022, but within a year of June 12, 2023. 

VA will grant a TDIU when the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of their service-connected disabilities, from securing and following "substantially gainful employment" consistent with their education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

"Substantially gainful employment" is that employment "which is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides." Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991). Substantially gainful employment has two components: one economic meaning an occupation earning more than marginal income as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person; and one noneconomic meaning consideration of a veteran's history, education, skill, training, physical ability, and mental ability. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019). 

Furthermore, marginal employment is not considered substantially gainful employment. Marginal employment may be held to exist on a fact found basis, to include, but not limited to, employment in a "protected environment," such as a family business or sheltered workshop, even when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. Employment in a protected environment generally means a lower-income position that, due to a veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market. See LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111 (2024). Consideration shall be given in all claims to the nature of the employment and the reason for termination. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The central inquiry is, "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). The Board must evaluate whether there are circumstances in a veteran's case, apart from any non-service connected condition and advancing age, which would justify a total rating based on individual unemployability due solely to the service-connected conditions. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993). The sole fact that a Veteran is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough. 

The regulations provide that if there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more, and if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability must bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). In exceptional circumstances, where the veteran does not meet the aforementioned percentage requirements, a total rating may nonetheless be assigned upon a showing that the individual is unable to obtain or retain substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). The Board notes that for the period on appeal prior to October 3, 2022, the Veteran's interstitial cystitis of the bladder was rated at 40% and she had a combined rating of 80%, meeting the requirements above.

Turning to the relevant evidence of record, at a January 2021 VA examination regarding her migraines, the Veteran reported her current occupation as food services and that she had lost 0-1 week of work time in the last 12 months due to her migraines. See January 2021 C&P Exam. She reported being unable to function and concentrate at work due to increased pain from her migraines. Id.

At a January 2021 VA examination regarding her interstitial cystitis, the Veteran similarly reported losing 0-1 week of work time in the last 12 months due to her disability. See January 2021 C&P Exam. She reported being unable to complete exercises or lift heavy objects due to pain from her disability. Id. 

At a September 2021 VA examination regarding her insomnia, the Veteran reported serving as a homemaker since separation from service and that she was currently studying healthcare management at university. See September 2021 C&P Exam. The examiner noted the Veteran had symptoms corresponding to decreased work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress. Id. 

At a December 2022 VA examination regarding the Veteran's PTSD, the Veteran reported she was unemployed but was attending school. See December 2022 C&P Exam. The examiner noted the Veteran had symptoms corresponding to occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior. 

In June 2023, the Veteran reported her work over the past five years (excluding the military) as working at FedEx from June 7, 2022 to October 15, 2022, and at Sitel from January 2023 to March 2023. See June 2023 VA 21-8940. She also reported Sitel as the only place she had tried to obtain employment since becoming too disabled to work, indicating she applied in December 2022. Id. The Board notes this does not appear to incorporate the food service work the Veteran reported at her January 2021 VA exam. 

The Board finds that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred on October 3, 2022, but no earlier, which is within the one-year preceding the date of receipt of the June 2023 VA 21-8940 application for increased compensation based on unemployability.

Here, there is no evidence to indicate that the Veteran's disabilities alone rendered her unemployable prior to October 3, 2022. The Veteran herself described herself as only applying to work at Sitel after becoming too disabled to work in her own opinion. Therefore, at a minimum, this indicates the Veteran did not consider herself too disabled to work when she applied to work for her employer before Sitel, FedEx, which she started working for in June 2022. The Veteran's reports regarding employment and functional impairment in the VA exams prior to October 2022 are consistent with this finding as well. While she reported being unemployed at times, and attending university classes, there is no evidence to suggest she was being prevented from working by her service-connected disabilities alone. She never stated she was unable to work, and the evidence indicates she did work periodically. There is no indication in the evidence why the Veteran left her food service job, and the only information given for why she no longer worked at FedEx was that she worked at FedEx in Georgia and had recently moved to Oklahoma. See December 2024 C&P Exam. The first indication that her disabilities had worsened in any sense was the filing of the October 3, 2022 claim for PTSD. 

Therefore, for the reasons above, the Board finds that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred on October 3, 2022, but no earlier, which is within the one-year preceding the date of receipt of the June 2023 VA 21-8940 application for increased compensation based on unemployability. Consequently, the criteria for an effective date for the grant of TDIU prior to October 3, 2022 must be denied.
