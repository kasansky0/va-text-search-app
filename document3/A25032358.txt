ISSUE

Entitlement to service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for COPD is DENIED.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's COPD did not begin during active service and is not related to an in-service injury, event, or illness.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for COPD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States from January 1967 to December 1970. On July 1, 2024, the Veteran filed a supplemental disability claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). On October 30, 2024, the VA Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision denying the issue on appeal. On November 5, 2024, the Veteran noted a timely appeal of the rating decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board). 

The appeal was prosecuted pursuant to the modernized review system.   

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDING AND CONCLUSION

I.

Duties to Notify and Assist

The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 and its implementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance in prosecuting their claims. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a). 

The Veteran has not raised any deficiencies in either the duties to notify or assist; therefore, the Board may proceed to the merits of the claim. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board....to search the record and address procedural arguments when the [appellant] fails to raise them before the Board"); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to an appellant's failure to raise a duty to assist argument before the Board).

Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this Decision, there is no requirement that every piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail. Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-130 (2000).

II.

Legal Criteria

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection may be established through the application of certain regulatory presumptions, or on a direct or secondary basis. 

COPD is not a chronic disease listed under section 3.309(a) of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations; therefore, the presumptive service connection provisions based on "chronic" in-service symptoms and "continuous" post-service symptoms under section 3.303(b) apply.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  However, the Veteran reported in an October 2023 VA-contracted examination that his symptoms started in 2007-2008. The Veteran has not alleged, nor has he submitted competent evidence to show, that he has suffered from COPD continuously since service. 38C.F.R. §3.303(b).  Consequently, service connection for COPD on the basis that such became manifest in service and persisted, is not warranted.

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for diseases associated with herbicide exposure under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 if a veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam between January 1962 and May 1975. Service in the Republic of Vietnam includes veterans on ships that operated not more than 12 nautical miles from the coast of Vietnam and Cambodia. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6). The Veteran's exposure to herbicides has been conceded; however, COPD is not a presumptive disease associated with herbicide agent exposure as listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309; therefore, presumptive service connection based on herbicide exposure is not warranted.

There is no contention, and the record does not support service connection on a secondary basis. The remaining theory of relief is direct service connection. To establish direct service connection for a claimed disorder, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999). 

The Board is required to give due consideration to all pertinent competent medical and lay evidence. Competent medical evidence is evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. 

Competent medical evidence may also include statements conveying sound medical principles found in medical treatises. It also includes statements contained in authoritative writings, such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses.?38?C.F.R. §?3.159(a)(1).  

Competent lay evidence is any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Id. §?3.159(a)(2). Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. Id. This may include some medical matters, such as describing symptoms or relating a contemporaneous medical diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

Lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson,?451 F.3d 1331?(Fed. Cir. 2006). 

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, the Board is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is at least in approximate balance, with the appellant prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.?38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?49?(1990); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. Id. 

The Board is required to assess the credibility and probative weight of all relevant evidence, and may consider factors such as facial plausibility, bias, self-interest, and consistency with other evidence of record. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 325 (2007) (Greene, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the Board has the duty to assess credibility and probative weight of evidence); see Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376 (affirming that the Board retains discretion to make credibility determinations and otherwise weigh the evidence submitted, including lay evidence); Buchanan, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (holding that the Board, as fact finder, is obligated to, and fully justified in, determining whether lay evidence is credible in and of itself, i.e., because of possible bias, conflicting statements, etc.). The court has also held that contemporaneous records are more probative than history reported by an appellant. See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994).

The Board has the authority to "discount the weight and probity of evidence in the light of its own inherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of evidence." Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998). 

In evaluating the probative value of competent medical evidence, the court has stated that the probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge, and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion that the physician reaches. See Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993). 

On August 10, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (Pact Act). See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168, § 403(d)(2) (2022). The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was enacted during the pendency of this appeal.

The PACT Act establishes a new VA examination and medical opinion standard where a veteran who participated in a toxic exposure risk activity during service makes a claim for service connection for a disability and the evidence is not sufficient to grant service connection for that disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1168. The PACT Act requires examiners to consider the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effects of all toxic exposures risk activities (TERA) for the Veteran. Id. 

With this analytic framework to guide us, we turn to the facts of the instant matter.

III.

Analysis

The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for his COPD and testified before the undersigned as to his contentions in February 2025, to include as a result of his TERA exposure in service. 

In a March 2024 rating decision, the RO determined that the Veteran was diagnosed with COPD in an October 2023 examination. Participation in TERA was also conceded.  The Board does not disturb these favorable findings by the RO. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the first and second Hickson elements are met. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA-contracted examination in October 2023 in which the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the claimed condition was    due to service as there was a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of COPD and military service. The examiner stated that without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury, was considered to be a more likely etiology. 

An addendum VA-contracted opinion was obtained in March 2024 in which the examiner stated that the Veteran's claim file noted that he was a smoker, tobacco smoker, of one pack of cigarettes a day. The examiner stated that the main cause of COPD in developed countries was tobacco smoking. Therefore, the COPD condition was less likely than not caused by herbicide exposure; the examiner also listed the Veteran's other conceded TERA exposure, noted in the footnote below, and stated that after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran, a nexus was not established.

The Veteran was afforded a VA-contracted examination in August 2024 in which the examiner stated that after reviewing medical records and performing physical examination, the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran. The examiner stated that while some of the Veteran's toxic exposures had been linked with pulmonary disease, he was a current smoker, with one pack per day on average, and had been smoking for decades. The examiner stated that the smoking, as a risk factor, far outweighed the TERA, since prolonged smoking was the primary risk factor for COPD.

The Board finds that the October 2023, March 2024, and August 2024 examiners provided negative nexus opinions. Specifically, the March and August 2024 examiners related the Veteran's COPD to his tobacco usage and not to service, to specifically include the Veteran's TERA.  The Board finds that the examiners' opinion were competent and probative of the facts at issue, as they were rendered after review of the Veteran's history and consideration of appropriate medical principles by a licensed medical professional. The rationale was supported and not conclusory. The Board gives these opinions great weight. Moreover, the Board observes that under 38 C.F.R. § 3.300(a), for claims received by VA after June 9, 1998, a disability or death will not be considered service-connected on the basis that it resulted from injury or disease attributable to the veteran's use of tobacco products during service.

The Veteran is competent to report his symptoms. Charles v. Principi, 16?Vet. App.?370, 374 (2002); see Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. This is beyond cavil. Id. However, the Board must still evaluate the credibility and probative value of the Veteran's statements. While lay statements are sufficient to describe what witnesses observe, such as the symptoms common to COPD, the Board does not believe lay statements are competent to diagnose the etiology of the disability in this case because it is medically complex. See, e.g., Kahana v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?428, 438 (2011); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4 (explaining that a veteran is competent to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition such as a broken leg, but not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions); Charles, 16?Vet. App.?at 374; Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 469-70 (1994). 

As such, the Board finds that the evidence does not establish the third Hickson element-evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Therefore, after careful review of the record evidence, the Board finds the Veteran's claim for service connection must fail because the most probative evidence does not indicate a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current COPD.  

In reaching this conclusion, the evidence persuasively stands against finding in favor of the claims in that it is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) ("[E]vidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."); Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. 49.  For these reasons, the claim for service connection for COPD is denied.

Although it interprets the law in a liberal manner, favoring the Veteran, the Board is a servant of the law and bound by it. And the law does not permit the Board to grant service connection without evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. In denying this appeal, the Board does what it must but wishes to convey its deepest sympathy to the Veteran for what he experienced, its great respect for his honorable service to this country, and its sincere regret that it cannot render a favorable decision in this matter.
