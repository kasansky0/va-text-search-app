ORDER

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to the service-connected sinusitis, is granted.

An effective date earlier than January 31, 2023, for the award of service connection for rhinitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused by his service-connected sinusitis.

2. A claim for service connection for rhinitis was not received within one year of the Veteran's June 2007 discharge.  On January 31, 2023, and no earlier, VA received a claim for service connection for the disability.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310.

2. The criteria for the assignment of an effective date earlier than January 31, 2023, for the award of service connection for rhinitis are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2001 to June 2007 in the United States Air Force, with additional service in the Air Force Reserves until January 2009.

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of October 2023 and March 2024 decisions.  In May 2024, the VA Regional Office issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior decisions.  

In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 and March 2024 rating decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the VA Regional Office issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to the service-connected sinusitis, is granted.

VA provides compensation for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  This is referred to as a "service connection."  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, in order to show a service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999). 

Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Such secondary service connection is also warranted for any increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b).

In Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023), the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held 38 U.S.C. § 1110 employs only "but-for" causation in direct and secondary service connection claims.  Therefore, a service-connected disability need only be a contributing cause, not the contributing cause, to establish secondary service connection.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  Evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

For the reasons described below, the Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea may be granted based on secondary causation.  As such, the matters of direct service connection and secondary aggravation need not be addressed.

The Veteran has current obstructive sleep apnea, documented, for example, on sleep study in February 2016.  Further, he has been awarded service connection for sinusitis.  See February 2025 Rating Decision Codesheet (most recent codesheet).  As for the etiology of the obstructive sleep apnea, the record contains two opinions addressing the relationship between that disability and the service-connected sinusitis.  

On VA examination in April 2023, the examiner opined that the current obstructive sleep apnea was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the service-connected sinusitis.  Rather, the examiner noted that according to medical literature, risk factors for the development of sleep apnea include being male, obesity, age, and smoking.

In a December 2023 medical report, the Veteran's treating VA physician, Dr. A. noted that she has treated the Veteran for both his chronic sinusitis, and his sleep apnea, which was diagnosed via an overnight in-lab polysomnogram in February 2016.  Dr. A. explained that research shows that patients with chronic sinusitis are more likely than those without the condition to develop obstructive sleep apnea.  Although the exact mechanisms for this connection are incompletely understood, it is believed that chronic nasal obstruction, and the reduction in the cross-sectional area of the airway due to permanent mucosal inflammation, explain the connection.  Dr. A. thus concluded that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused by his service-connected chronic sinusitis.

Additionally, in May 2023, the Veteran submitted medical literature supporting an association between sleep apnea and sinusitis.  The literature indicates that symptoms of sinusitis can cause difficulty with respiration while sleeping, thereby increasing the risk of sleep apnea. 

Considering the evidence under the laws and regulations as set forth above, and resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the evidence persuasively favors an award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as caused by the service-connected sinusitis.  The December 2023 medical opinion of Dr. A. is fully adequate for adjudication as she based her findings on a medical literature and a history of treating the Veteran for his disabilities, and provided a rationale for the conclusion reached.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).  Her opinion is supported by the medical literature submitted by the Veteran.

In contrast, the medical opinion of the April 2023 VA examiner is not persuasive to the extent the examiner did not adequately explain why the current obstructive sleep apnea is not attributable to the Veteran's sinusitis, or the application of the identified risk factors to his case.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning).

Thus, on this record, the evidence is in at least in approximate balance in showing that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is attributable to his service-connected sinusitis.  In resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection is warranted.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

2. An effective date earlier than January 31, 2023, for the award of service connection for rhinitis is denied.

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection based upon an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase is either the day following separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise it will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b). 

A claim is a formal or informal communication, in writing, requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p).  VA amended its regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  

Any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a claimant, his duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not sui juris, may be considered an informal claim.  Such an informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If received within one year after the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155; Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413 (1999). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  Evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

The Veteran seeks an effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for rhinitis, based on the date of enactment of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act).  See, e.g., July 21, 2023, VA Form 20-0996.

The Veteran separated from service in June 2007.  A claim for service connection for rhinitis was not received within one year of the date of discharge.  

On January 31, 2023, VA received a VA Form 21-256EZ (Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits), in which he requested service connection for several disabilities, including rhinitis.  

In an April 2023 rating decision, the VA Regional Office granted service connection for rhinitis, effective from the date of the Veteran's January 31, 2023, claim.  Thereafter, the Veteran continuously pursued the matter of an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for rhinitis.

Because the current effective date for the award of service connection was based upon the date the January 31, 2023, claim was received, the question before the Board is whether there is any earlier claim upon which an earlier effective date may be granted.  On review of the record, however, the Board can point to no communication prior to the January 31, 2023, claim that may serve as a claim for service connection for rhinitis.  While the Veteran filed written correspondence and claims pertaining to other disabilities, it was not until January 31, 2023, that he expressed any intent to apply for service connection for rhinitis.  Thus, the only date that could serve as a basis for the award of service connection is the date of receipt of the January 31, 2023, claim for service connection.    

The exact date on which entitlement arose need not be ascertained in order to conclude that the January 31, 2023, date selected by the VA Regional Office is the earliest possible effective date here.  The reason for this is that, to the extent that entitlement arose prior to January 31, 2023, the date of claim would be the later of the two, and hence the correct effective date as provided by 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  Any evidence showing that the entitlement occurred after January 31, 2023, would similarly not entitle the appellant to an effective date earlier than that already assigned.     

The Board has considered the Veteran's report that the PACT Act applies to his claim, thereby allowing for an earlier effective date.  As noted, in general, the effective date for an award of service connection will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  An exception applies where an award of compensation is due to a liberalizing change in the law or an administrative issue.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(p), 3.114(a).  VA regulations provide that where a service connection claim is received by VA within one year after a change in law, and all the requirements were met for a grant of service connection on the effective date of the change, the proper effective date shall be the date of the change in the law.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(1).  

Here, the Board recognizes that the Veteran's January 31, 2023, claim was received within one year of the August 10, 2022, implementation of the PACT Act.  However, a close review of the record reveals that presumptive service connection for rhinitis under the PACT Act is not applicable.  While rhinitis is included on the list of diseases eligible for such service connection, the Veteran did not serve in any of the locations eligible for presumptive service connection based on exposure to burn pits and other toxins pursuant to the PACT Act.  These locations include Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Somalia, the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, Afghanistan, Djibouti, Syria, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Yemen.  Here, the Veteran's service separation document (DD Form 214), service treatment records, service personnel records, and individual longitudinal exposure records show that his oversea service during active duty in the Air Force was limited to Korea.  Indeed, VA Memoranda dated from August 2023, October 2023, November 2023, and March 2024 confirm that the Veteran did not serve in a location contemplated by 38 U.S.C. §1117, §1119, or §1120.

The Board considered the fact that the above-referenced VA Memoranda document that the Veteran participated in toxic exposure risk activities in the course of his duties as a satellite and wideband communications system craftsman during active duty in the Air Force between 2001 and 2007, while stationed in Korea.  These Memoranda show that the Veteran was exposed to toxic fumes, chemical fine particulate airborne matter, smoke, exhaust, and jet fuel during such service.  However, on VA examination in March 2023, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's rhinitis was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activities, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.  Instead, the examiner provided a positive nexus opinion based on direct service connection.  Thus, the requirements for service connection based on the PACT Act were not met on the August 10, 2022, date of enactment.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(1).  It was not until the March 2023 VA examination report was rendered that service connection was warranted on a direct basis, thereby triggering the application of the standard effective date rules set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

There is simply no legal entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for the Veteran's rhinitis.  As such, the claim must be denied.
