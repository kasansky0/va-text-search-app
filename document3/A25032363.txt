ORDER

Whether the proposed severance of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea was proper is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The rating decision proposing severance for service connection for sleep apnea based on CUE was not a final decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the proposed severance for service connection for sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 2017 to August 2021.

This matter is on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Here, the Board notes the December 2023 rating decision on appeal was not a final rating decision.  Rather, it was a proposal to sever service connection for sleep apnea.  

The RO didn't actually make a final determination of the severance prior to the Veteran filing his Form 10182.  A few months after the Veteran filed his Form 10182, the RO issued an April 2024 rating decision severing service connection.

Thus, because the December 2023 rating decision was not a final decision, there is no appealable rating decision for the Board to adjudicate.  Thus, the matter will be dismissed.

It is important for the Veteran to understand that since he filed this appeal, the RO issued a final rating decision in the matter of whether to sever service connection for sleep apnea.  The Veteran may appeal that decision should he chose.  Any argument as to why the action of the RO should not have been taken should be directed to the RO.
