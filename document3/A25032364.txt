ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with depressive disorder is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's PTSD with depressive disorder has been manifested by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, but not total occupational and social impairment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for service-connected PTSD with depressive disorder have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1988 to January 2009. He received medals and commendation to include the South West Asia Service Medal with Bronze Service Star. His service to our Nation is greatly appreciated.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that in the January 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for service-connected PTSD from two separate rating decisions, the December 2023 rating decision on appeal herein, and a November 2023 rating decision. As both rating decisions are part of the same appeal, the Board chose the later December 2023 rating decision as the rating decision on appeal herein because the later dated rating decision allows the Board to consider additional evidence of record that it would not be able to consider if it selected the November 2023 rating decision as the appealed decision.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Different ratings may be assigned for different periods of time for the same disorder if the facts show distinct time periods with different levels of disability. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for service-connected PTSD with depressive disorder is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a rating in excess of 70 percent for his service-connected PTSD with depressive disorder.

The Veteran's PTSD with depressive disorder has been rated at 70 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 9411 throughout the entire period on appeal, which began when the Veteran filed his claim for service connection for PTSD with depressive disorder on June 14, 2023. See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).

The Board notes that Diagnostic Code 9411 is subject to the criteria listed under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

In relevant part, a 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent rating is warranted for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

The psychiatric symptoms listed in the above rating criteria are not exclusive but are examples of typical symptoms for the listed percentage ratings. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-18 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Board finds that the overall record does not shows that at any time during the appeal period that the Veteran's PTSD with depressive disorder was manifested by symptoms such as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Further, the record does not establish that the Veteran has total occupational and social impairment.

Regarding occupational impairment, throughout VA treatment records and during the June 2023 VA PTSD examination, the Veteran has reported that he works as an IT program manager at a retirement community and that he loves his work. See November 2023 CAPRI. Given the presence of an occupation, especially one that he loves working, throughout the appeal period, the record does not reflect total occupational impairment. "Total" is defined as "whole, not divided; full; complete," and "utter, absolute." Black's Law Dictionary, 1498 (7th ed. 1999).

Regarding social impairment, VA treatment records show that although the Veteran divorced from his first wife in 2001, he remarried in 2021 and has been married since that time. See November 2023 CAPRI. In a November 2023 VA treatment record, the Veteran reported that he plays tabletop games with friends. Id. Given the presence of these relationships throughout the appeal period, the record does not reflect total social impairment.

Moreover, as the Veteran has not reported and the evidence of record has not shown an increase in severity in his PTSD with depressive disorder, there is no pre-decisional duty to assist error, and remand for a current VA examination is not warranted.

Considering the severity, duration, and frequency of all manifestations, whether listed in the schedule or note, the Board finds that the disability does not more nearly approximate total disability. As summarized above, the Veteran retains some level of occupational and social functioning.

In sum, the Board finds that a disability rating in excess of the currently assigned 70 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's PTSD with depressive disorder at any time during the appellate period. To the extent that the Veteran contends entitlement to a higher rating, the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim; there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved; and any further increased rating is not warranted. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Board is grateful for the Veteran's honorable service, and this decision is in no way meant to detract from that service. However, given the record before it, entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent his service-connected PTSD with depressive disorder is not warranted.
