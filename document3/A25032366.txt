DOCKET NO. 240927-478052
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral tinnitus is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In an October 2024 statement that contains the Veteran's name and claim number, the Veteran clearly expressed his wish to withdraw his claim on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal have been met with respect to the claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral tinnitus. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2), (d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1981 to July 1985. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). In a September 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran selected Hearing with a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).

Appeal withdrawals must be in writing, must include the name of the claimant, the applicable claim number, and a statement that the appeal is being withdrawn, and must be received by the Board prior to issuance of a decision on the claim or claims being withdrawn. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204(b).

An October 2024 letter from the Veteran's representative, which contains the Veteran's name and claim number, stated his intention to withdraw his appeal. See October 2024 VA Form 20-10208. The Board finds that this statement clearly expresses his wish to withdraw his appeal of the issue currently on appeal before the Board, as listed above. The Veteran's withdrawal was received prior to a decision by the Board on this issue. Accordingly, the criteria for withdrawal of an appeal are satisfied.

When a pending appeal is withdrawn, there is no longer an allegation of error of fact or law with respect to the determination that was appealed. Thus, dismissal of the appeal is appropriate. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d). Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral tinnitus is dismissed.
