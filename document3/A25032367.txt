Entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 70 percent for PTSD from June 5, 2019 is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to June 23, 2017 is denied.

Entitlement to SMC at the statutory housebound rate prior to June 5, 2019 is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction, which was received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on June 3, 2016; nothing in the electronic record could be construed as an earlier claim seeking service connection for erectile dysfunction and entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ.

2. Prior to June 5, 2019, the evidence of record reflects the Veteran's PTSD manifested in symptoms resulting in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity; his PTSD was not manifested by symptoms resulting in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, or total occupational and social impairment.

3. From June 5, 2019, the Veteran's PTSD manifested by symptoms resulting in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood; the Veteran's PTSD was not manifested by symptoms resulting in total occupational and social impairment.

4. Prior to June 23, 2017, the record does not reflect that the Veteran was unable to obtain or retain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities.

5. Prior to June 5, 2019, the Veteran did not have a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent (to include TDIU for PTSD alone) in addition to other service-connected disabilities with a combined rating of at least 60 percent.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than June 3, 2016 for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.157, 3.159, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than June 3, 2016 for the award of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.157, 3.159, 3.400.

3. The criteria for an initial disability rating greater than 50 percent for PTSD prior to June 5, 2019 are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

4. The criteria for an initial disability rating greater than 70 percent for PTSD from June 5, 2019 are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, DC 9411.

5. The criteria for entitlement to TDIU prior to June 23, 2017 are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.16.

6. The criteria for SMC at the statutory housebound rate prior to June 5, 2019 are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(s), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350(i).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1968 to January 1971.  He appeals a November 2023 rating decision by the VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granting service connection for erectile dysfunction, effective June 3, 2016.  See September 2024 VA Form 10182.  Also, before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is the appeal of a May 2024 rating decision denying an initial disability rating greater than 50 percent for PTSD prior to June 5, 2019 and 70 percent thereafter.  Id.  The Veteran requested the Board review the appeal under the evidence docket.  Id.  Additionally, the Veteran waived the right to select a different Board review option, and the Board may proceed with adjudication.  See January 2025 Veteran letter.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see also Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Under the evidence review docket, the Board must consider the evidence before the AOJ at the time of November 2023 and May 2024 rating decisions, respectively for each corresponding issue, as well as any additional evidence submitted by the Veteran to VA within 90 days of VA's receipt of the September 2024 VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  The Board cannot consider (1) evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the rating decisions on appeal and before the September 2024 VA Form 10182 was received by VA, or (2) any evidence submitted more than 90 days after the September 2024 VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Effective Date for Erectile Dysfunction

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection will be on the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever date is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The date of receipt for any claim is the date the claim was received by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  Additionally, a claim must be filed for any type of benefit to accrue or be paid.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (1998).

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim could be either a formal or informal written communication evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  The essential elements to any claim are that it must be in writing, must identify the benefit sought, and must reflect an intent to apply for benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5101; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (1999); Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377 (1999); Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501 (2006).

After March 24, 2015, however, a claim must be filed on the form prescribed by the Secretary and must be filed for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151.

Here, the Veteran filed a formal claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction, which was received by VA on June 3, 2016.  See June 2016 VA Form 21-526EZ.

The record reflects the Veteran began to suffer from erectile dysfunction in the early 2000s, well before he filed the June 2016 VA Form 21-526EZ.  See June 2015 VA treatment records (erectile dysfunction for 7 to 8 years, gradual onset).  However, as noted above, the date of award of service connection will be the date the claim was received by VA or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Here, the later date is the date the claim was received by VA, June 3, 2016.

The Veteran's representative contends the effective date for service connection for erectile dysfunction should be earlier as "it is equally as likely that [the Veteran's] erectile dysfunction was caused by his PTSD and/or coronary artery disease as his hypertension."  See September 2024 VA Form 10182.  Be that as it may, the effective date for an award of service connection is the later of the date entitlement arose or date of receipt of claim.  Additionally, "generally all theories of service connection are part of the same claim."  See Schroeder v. West, 212 F.3d 1265, 1269-70 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Roebuck v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 307, 313 (2006).  After review of the record, the Board finds no evidence the Veteran filed any formal or informal claim for erectile dysfunction or provided any statements indicating an intent to file a claim prior to his original claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction, received by VA on June 3, 2016.

Accordingly, the AOJ assigned the earliest possible effective date provided by law and an effective date earlier than June 3, 2016 for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction and SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ is denied.

Increased Rating for PTSD

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

When considering the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection is required.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 199, 125-26 (1999).  Finally, when there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran's PTSD is initially rated at 50 percent disabling prior to June 5, 2019 and 70 percent thereafter under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411, which provides the following relevant rating criteria:

A 50 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect, circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech, panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty in understanding complex commands, impairment of short-and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks), impaired judgment, impaired abstract thinking, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty in establishing effective work and social relationships.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

A 70 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  Id.

Finally, a 100 percent rating is warranted for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or name.  Id.

For a PTSD rating, the Board must conduct a holistic analysis that considers the severity, frequency, and duration of all associated symptoms with the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a).  Then, the Board must determine whether the Veteran's symptomatology caused a level of impairment in "most areas" applicable to the relevant percentage rating criteria.  See Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 116-19 (2013).

The list of symptoms in the above rating criteria are meant to be examples that would warrant the rating, but are not meant to be exhaustive, and the Board need not find all or even some of the symptoms to award a specific rating.  On the other hand, if the evidence shows the Veteran suffers symptoms or effects that cause occupational or social impairment equivalent to what would be caused by the symptoms listed in the diagnostic code, the appropriate equivalent rating will be assigned.  See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442-43 (2002).

There are four VA examination reports and two private evaluations of record, in addition to numerous mental health VA treatment records and Vet Center Records that the Board will use to assess the overall impairment caused by the Veteran's PTSD symptoms.  As the AOJ increased the Veteran's initial 50 percent rating to 70 percent, effective June 5, 2019, the Board will separately consider the time periods.

Prior to June 5, 2019

Prior to June 5, 2019, the record reflects the Veteran's PTSD symptoms manifested in no more than occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

In April 2015, Dr. C.C. evaluated the Veteran, diagnosed him with PTSD, and ultimately concluded that the Veteran's symptoms resulted in "occupational and functional impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency, and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although he generally functions satisfactorily."  See April 2015 Dr. C.C. evaluation report.  Dr. C.C.'s medical opinion corresponds to the rating criteria for a 30 percent disability rating for PTSD and the Board finds the private opinion highly probative as Dr. C.C. is an experienced psychiatrist who evaluated and considered the Veteran's reported symptoms in the detailed evaluation report.  For example, Dr. C.C. noted that the Veteran had markedly diminished interest in activities, was socially "detached" with "few friends," and had five failed past marriages.  Id.  After examination, Dr. C.C. noted the Veteran's symptoms included intermittent anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, panic attacks, and memory loss.  Id.  However, during the examination, Dr. C.C. found the Veteran completely oriented, well groomed and dressed, and had fair insight and judgment.  Id.  Although Dr. C.C. noted the Veteran exhibited mild psychomotor agitation, "somewhat circumstantial" thought processes and constricted affect, Dr. C.C. concluded that the Veteran's symptoms met the criteria for a 30 percent rating.  The Board notes that circumstantial thought and flattened affect are symptoms listed within the Veteran's current 50 percent rating, and none of the criteria discussed at the April 2015 evaluation report meet the criteria for a rating greater than 50 percent.  For example, the Veteran's speech may have been circumstantial, but it did not rise to the level of "intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant."  Additionally, the Veteran denied suicidal or homicidal ideation, plan, or intent, including impaired impulse control issues.  Id.  Nor did the Veteran endorse suffering from any near-continuous panic or depression affecting independent functioning; rather, the Veteran endorsed "intermittent anxiety."  Id.

Overall, the Board finds the April 2014 Dr. C.C. evaluation report well encapsulates the Veteran's PTSD symptoms prior to June 5, 2019, and is supported by the surrounding VA examinations and treatment records.  See, e.g., August 2014 Vet Center records (logical, coherent, oriented, "anger is better...episodes of sadness and depression along with anxiety"); November 2014 Vet Center records (difficulty forming meaningful relationships); January 2015 Vet Center records (flat, blunted affect, depression, lack of interest).

Socially, the Veteran consistently discussed that he had no "close friends" and isolated himself.  See, e.g., October 2014 VA treatment records.  Indeed, the Board finds that prior to June 5, 2019, the Veteran had difficulty establishing and maintaining effective relationships, but the record did not reflect he was unable to maintain effective relationships.  For example, the Veteran reported "some contact" with his four children, noting "good relationships" with his younger two children and less contact with his two older children, who lived in a different state.  See January 2015, June 2015, and July 2018 VA examination reports.  At the July 2018 examination report, the Veteran reported he was intermittently living with a partner for the last 18 months, enjoyed going to sing karaoke, and noted he was involved in his children's activities.  The aforementioned reflects the Veteran had difficulty but could establish and maintain effective relationships prior to June 5, 2019.

Occupationally, the Veteran reported he retired at 62 years old after owning several different businesses throughout his life, most recently owning and running a sports bar for 15 years.  Id.; see also April 2015 C.C. evaluation report.  The Veteran stated he retired because he did not want to "take time away from his kids," and did not mention his mental health symptoms effected his ability to maintain substantial employment.  See, e.g., January 2015 examination report.  VA treatment records and Vet Center records also reflect that the Veteran worked somewhere between part- and fulltime in the years after his retirement.  See November 2014 Vet Center records ("he has 'acquaintances' he helps with odd jobs on a regular basis"); March 2015 Vet Center records (working fulltime); December 2017 VA treatment records (working in maintenance in recent months, but "his colitis became so severe that he had to stop doing this a few months ago.").  At the July 2018 VA examination, the Veteran denied any previous work problems with his superiors or peers, and noted anger, irritability, and fluctuations in mood "really affected [him] when [he] was younger" but stated he was "better now."  This evidence does not reflect occupational impairment.

The evidence of record persuasively reflects that the Veteran did not have social and occupational impairment in most areas, as his judgment, thinking, work, and family relations were generally fair.  The Veteran was consistently able to conduct ADLs, was fully oriented with logical and normal speech, denied impaired impulse control, suicidal or homicidal ideation, and was not found to have difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances.  Id.  Overall, the record prior to June 5, 2019 reflects the Veteran's PTSD symptoms resulted in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  As such, the Veteran is not entitled to an initial disability rating greater than 50 percent for PTSD prior to June 5, 2019.

From June 5, 2019

In June 2019, the Veteran received a psychiatric evaluation from Dr. H.H.G. who provided a probative, detailed evaluation of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms and opined that his symptoms resulted in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.  See June 2019 Dr. H.H.G. examination report.  As a result of the June 2019 examination report, the AOJ granted entitlement to a 70 percent rating, effective the date of the Veteran's assessment.

After review, the Board finds the record persuasively reflects the Veteran's symptoms do not manifest in total social and occupational impairment from June 5, 2019.

At the June 2019 examination, the Veteran noted all the symptoms discussed above, including mild memory loss, panic attacks, flattened affect, sleep impairment, anxiety, depression, and difficulty establishing and maintaining relationships.  Id.  The Veteran also noted the increase of symptoms, including near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, and the inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  Id.  The Veteran's reported symptoms increased in severity, but do not reflect any symptoms noted within the 100 percent rating criteria and do not rise to the level of total social and occupational impairment when his symptom picture is holistically considered.  Id.

For example, the Veteran did not report and the record does not reflect persistent delusions or hallucinations or that the Veteran was ever a danger to himself or others.  See, e.g., June 2019 H.H.G. examination report; August 2020 VA examination report.  The Veteran was never found disoriented or to have memory loss so severe he forgets the names of close relative or even his own name.  Further, the Veteran was consistently able to perform ADLs, manage his finances, and never exhibited grossly inappropriate behavior or gross impairment in thought or communication.  In fact, numerous VA treatment records reflect the Veteran denied depression, anxiety, sleep impairment, and various other symptoms during the appeal period.  See, e.g., August 2020 VA examination report; July 2021 VA treatment records (negative PTSD screening); May 2020 VA treatment records (denies depression, insomnia, or suicidal ideation, PTSD, sleep disturbances or sleep loss); August 2022 VA treatment records (denies recent changes in mood; denies anxiety and depression).  Thus, based on two examination reports in conjunction with the treatment records, there is no evidence the Veteran suffered from total social and occupational impairment from June 5, 2019.

As such, the Board finds the Veteran's symptoms did not rise to the level of total social or occupational impairment, the criteria required for a 100 percent rating.

In summation, the Board denies an initial rating greater than 50 percent for PTSD prior to June 5, 2019 and 70 percent thereafter.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

TDIU Prior to June 23, 2017 and TDIU Based Solely on PTSD

The Veteran's representative contends the Veteran is entitled to SMC at the statutory housebound rate from June 23, 2017 "on account of PTSD by itself rendering [the Veteran] unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" in addition to having other combined service-connected disabilities separately rated at 60 percent.  See September 2024 VA Form 10182.

The Board notes the Veteran received entitlement to TDIU from June 23, 2017 based on multiple service-connected disabilities.  See May 2024 rating decision codesheet.  Additionally, the Veteran received a 100 percent, or total, disability rating for coronary artery disease (CAD), also resulting in entitlement to SMC based on the need for the regular aid and attendance of another under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l), both effective June 5, 2020.  See September 2020 rating decision.

However, a 100 percent disability rating does not always render the issue of TDIU moot as VA has a duty to maximize a claimant's benefits.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011).  Here, TDIU based on an individual disability raises the possibility of entitlement to additional benefits, such as entitlement to SMC.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).

Additionally, although the AOJ granted entitlement to TDIU from June 23, 2017, the issue of entitlement to TDIU has been raised in this case and must be considered by the Board for the entire appeal period.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-55 (2009); Harper v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 356, 361 (2018).  As such, the Board will discuss entitlement to TDIU prior to June 23, 2017 in addition to entitlement to TDIU based on PTSD alone.

Total disability will be considered to exist where there presently is any impairment of mind and body that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.340.  Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that the Veteran meets the schedular requirements.  Specifically, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability that is ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

Prior to June 3, 2016, the Veteran's combined rating was 60 percent, with PTSD rated at 50 percent, and tinnitus and CAD both rated at 10 percent disabling.  See May 2024 rating decision codesheet.  Thus, the Veteran does not meet the statutory requirement for entitlement to TDIU prior to June 3, 2016.  When the percentage requirements are not met, entitlement to TDIU may be considered on an extraschedular basis; however, the Board does not have the authority to assign extra-schedular TDIU in the first instance, but it may refer the issue to the Director of the Compensation Service, for a determination in the first instance as to whether the Veteran is entitled to TDIU on an extra-schedular basis under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  See Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1 (2001).  Here, the Board finds referral to the Director of the Compensation Service unwarranted as the persuasive evidence of record, discussed in detail below, does not substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was unemployable by reason of his service-connected disabilities, to include PTSD alone.  See Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1, 6-8 (2021).

From June 3, 2016 to June 22, 2017, the Veteran's combined rating is 80 percent with PTSD and sleep apnea each rated at 50 percent disabling.  Hence, the Veteran meets the statutory requirement for entitlement to TDIU from June 3, 2016 to June 22, 2017.

The Board will first consider entitlement to TDIU prior to June 23, 2017.

In determining whether a veteran can secure, follow, and maintain a substantially gainful occupation, the Board must consider: (1) the Veteran's occupational history, education, skill, and training; (2) whether the Veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and (3) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).

After service, the Veteran completed college, obtained a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in 1989, and worked numerous jobs.  See April 2015 Dr. C.C. examination report; January 2015 and July 2018 VA examination reports.  The Veteran reported he owned several different businesses throughout his life.  Id.  For example, the Veteran stated he owned a beef jerky business, worked in auto repair, and owned different sports bars, most recently selling one around 2010 that he owned for 15 years.  Id.  The Veteran also reported he was a professor for 12 years at the college through which he received his MBA.  Id.  Overall, the record reflects the Veteran has the education and occupational background to work in any unskilled labor position, skilled customer service position, any standard clerical position within a typical office setting, and managerial or business-oriented positions that could utilize his MBA experience.  The Board also finds the Veteran also has the background and qualification to teach at a local college or begin a similar business to those previously owned.

During the appeal period, the Veteran noted he worked "part time" in maintenance at a property management company, maintaining a schedule of only 25 hours per week from 2014 to 2017.  See November 2018 VA Form 21-8940.  March 2015 Vet Center records reflect the Veteran reported working full time and December 2017 VA treatment records reflect the Veteran was working in maintenance in the recent months, but "his colitis became so severe that he had to stop" working.  The Veteran received entitlement to TDIU from June 2017, the date he was service connected for his colitis.  A November 2018 VA Form 21-4192 filled out by his last employer noted the Veteran was working part time and "he informed his immediate manager that he was retiring" in the end of October 2017.  As such, the record reflects the Veteran was working, at least part time, prior to June 23, 2017.

In January 2015, the Veteran stated that although he retired at 62 years old, he considered helping a friend with remodeling, but noted he "[made] an effort not to get involved in anything that will take time away from his kids," which reflects that the Veteran chose not to seek employment for his children's sake, not that his service-connected disabilities prevented his ability to maintain employment.  See January 2015 VA examination report.  Notably, the Veteran mentioned on multiple occasions that he retired from employment, never that he was unable to continue employment or that he had to stop working due to a service-connected disability.  The July 2018 examiner noted the Veteran did not report any relational problems with superiors or peers during past employment.  Thus, the record persuasively reflects the Veteran retired for reasons not related to his service-connected disabilities and that he continued working, at least part time, until his service-connected colitis impaired his ability to work in June 2017.

Overall, the Veteran's PTSD symptoms are noted in great detail above.  Only the June 2019 Dr. H.H.G. examination report found the Veteran's symptoms included difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, such as work, near continuous panic/depression affecting independent function, and being unable to establish effective relationships.  As a result of the June 2019 evaluation, Dr. H.H.G. opined that the Veteran could "not sustain the stress from a competitive work environment or be expected to engage in gainful activity due to his PTSD."  See June 2019 Dr. H.H.G. examination report.  Dr. H.H.G. notes the Veteran's sleep impairment would cause safety issues in the workplace, and his memory loss, anxiety, and poor interpersonal skills would impair his ability to work safely and productively.  Id.  The Board finds Dr. H.H.G.'s medical opinion probative and reflects the Veteran's symptoms increased from the date of the June 2019 examination.

Undoubtedly, the Board finds the Veteran's symptoms from June 2019 would impair his ability to work in many environments, including those requiring close supervision or a high-paced stressful business environment.  However, the Veteran maintained his own businesses throughout much of his life and he has the education and experience to work in numerous high-skilled and specialized fields.  The Board finds the Veteran's PTSD symptoms, although severe even at the 70 percent disability rating, would not prevent him from obtaining and maintaining employment as a teacher or professor, he could also work a standard position within a typical office setting with his MBA, or he could build a new business and be self-employed.  The Veteran has not indicated that his PTSD symptoms ever prevented or impaired prior employment and has affirmatively stated he retired to spend more time with his children, and he stopped working parttime due to colitis, not his mental health.  The Board finds the Veteran's statements throughout the record more probative than Dr. H.H.G.'s medical opinion as the Veteran knows his history, daily experience, and personal feelings better than Dr. H.H.G. who examined him on one occasion.

Overall, prior to June 3, 2016, the evidence above does not reflect a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was unemployable by reason of his service-connected disabilities prior to June 3, 2016.  The Veteran's PTSD symptoms in combination with his service-connected CAD and tinnitus do not suggest he was unable to maintain employment due to his disabilities.  For his CAD rated at 10 percent disabling, the Veteran denied any symptoms with physical activity or otherwise.  See July 2016 VA examination report.  Similarly, the Veteran denied any impairment for his "constant non-disabling tinnitus," rated at 10 percent disabling.  Id.  The Board finds referral to the Director of the Compensation Service is unwarranted; the Veteran reported he retired and continued to work only part time to be with his children.

Further, entitlement to TDIU prior to June 23, 2017 is unwarranted.  The Veteran's PTSD symptoms remained unchanged, but the Veteran's combined disability rating increased to 80 percent from June 3, 2016.  The Veteran was subsequently service connected for hypertension rated at 10 percent and sleep apnea rated at 50 percent.  While sleep apnea causes persistent daytime hypersomnolence, chronic sleep impairment and daytime fatigue are also considered within his PTSD rating.  See May 2023 VA examination report.  Additionally, the Veteran's hypertension has no functional impact on the Veteran's ability to work.  See, e.g., December 2019 VA examination reports.  Thus, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities would not prevent him from employment in a field in which he is already experienced and qualified, such as self-employment, business management, or teaching.

Additionally, referral to the Director for entitlement to TDIU based solely on PTSD prior to June 5, 2019 is also unwarranted as the record does not reflect a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was unemployable solely by reason of his PTSD.  In fact, the Veteran's statements persuasively reflect that his PTSD symptoms alone did not prevent employment at any point in the appeal period.  In summation, the Board finds the Veteran is not entitled to TDIU prior to June 23, 2017, nor is he entitled to TDIU based on PTSD alone from June 23, 2017.  As such, his claim for SMC based on the statutory housebound rate prior to June 5, 2020 is denied.
