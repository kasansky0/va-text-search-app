Entitlement to a higher rate of special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114, to include benefits under subsection (o), is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for tension headaches is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. There is no existing, unadjudicated claim for an effective date earlier than March 31, 2015, for the grant of service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome.

2. Prior to October 1, 2021, the Veteran's hearing acuity has not been shown to be higher than Level 1 hearing in the right ear and Level II in the left ear.

3. As of October 1, 2021, the Veteran's hearing acuity has not been shown to be higher than Level IX in the right ear and Level X in the left ear.

4. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's CFS symptoms are productive of nearly constant symptoms and restrict routine daily activities to less than 50 percent of the pre-illness level.

5. While the Board is legally prohibited from separating the Veteran's ratings, the symptoms of the Veteran's COPD and OSA disabilities are best compensated by evaluating the disabilities as a single entity.

6. The combination of the Veteran's disability ratings does not meet the criteria for a higher SMC rating, to include (but not limited to) an award under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(o).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army from June 1980 to March 1986.

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from several Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rating decisions of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) dated November 2021 (for the claims related to COPD, OSA, and SMC), March 2022 (for the claims related to headaches), with each of these claims followed by a January 2023 higher-level review decision, as well as decision from March 2023 with a later June 2023 higher-level review decision (for the claim related to CFS), and April 2023 (for the claim relating to bilateral hearing loss and SMC).

The Board notes that the procedural history regarding the Veteran's claims is varied. Regarding the Veteran's claims involving bilateral hearing loss, it was initially granted in a November 2021 rating decision. In October 2022 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review (HLR) seeking, among other things, an earlier effective date for the grant his hearing loss disability. In subsequent rating decisions, the AOJ addressed whether the 70 percent rating warranted an earlier effective date than October 1, 2021, but failed to address whether the Veteran was entitled to an earlier effective date for the initial grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss. As the issue of whether the initial award of service connection warrants an earlier effective date was not addressed by the AOJ in the time after the Veteran's October 2022 HLR request, it is still pending before the AOJ and is not before the Board. Instead, what is before the Board is the Veteran's claim for a higher rating for his bilateral hearing loss disability, which is discussed in-depth below.

Turning the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for his CFS, the Board finds that it is a freestanding claim and must be dismissed as a matter of law. Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006). Here, the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for CFS was raised by the Veteran in his January 2024 VA Form 10182, filed in reply to a June 2023 rating decision. However, the June 2023 rating decision only addressed the disability rating of his CFS, and not the effective date of service connection. Per Rudd, only a request for revision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) could result in the assignment of an effective date earlier than the date assigned by a final VA decision inasmuch as free-standing claims for earlier effective dates would otherwise vitiate the rule of finality. In this case, the Veteran has not made a claim of CUE, but rather, has stated that he is entitled to an earlier effective date simply because he wants an earlier date. Nevertheless, he is not precluded from submitting such a claim for CUE in the future. 

In January 2024 the Veteran filed his VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, electing the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider evidence that was before the AOJ at the time of the rating decisions on appeal for their respective claims, prior to the higher-level reviews. Any evidence submitted outside the permitted window cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider the additional evidence that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and identify the evidence for the AOJ's consideration. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision

INCREASED RATINGS

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. The benefit of the doubt will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. If the evidence persuasively favors one side, the evidence is not in approximate balance and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule will not be applied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating prior to October 1, 2021, and in excess of 70 percent thereafter for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran contends that his hearing loss disability warrants higher disability ratings. See January 2024 VA Form 10182. For the reasons addressed below, the Board disagrees, and finds against the Veteran.

The assignment of a disability rating for hearing loss is derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the specific numeric designations assigned after audiological testing is completed. Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992). This formula is obtained from the "puretone threshold average," as used in Table VI is the sum of the puretone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hertz, divided by four. Generally, this average is used to determine a Roman numeral designation from Table VI. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(d).

When the puretone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz are each 55 decibels or more, this is considered an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment. When this occurs, a Roman numeral designation will be determined from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral. Each ear will be evaluated separately.

Table VI, "Numeric Designation of Hearing Impairment Based on Puretone Threshold Average and Speech Discrimination," is used to determine a Roman numeral designation (I through XI) for hearing impairment based on a combination of the percent of speech discrimination (horizontal rows) and the puretone threshold average (vertical columns). The Roman numeral designation is located at the point where the row and column intersect. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(b).

Table VIA, "Numeric Designation of Hearing Impairment Based Only on Puretone Threshold Average," is also used to determine a Roman numeral designation (I through XI) for hearing impairment based solely on the puretone threshold average when an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment exists. Id. 

Table VII, "Percentage Evaluations of Hearing Impairment," is used to determine the percentage evaluation by combining the Roman numeral designations for hearing impairment in each ear. The horizontal rows represent the ear having the better hearing and the vertical columns represent the ear having the poorer hearing. The percentage evaluation is located at the point where the row and the column intersect. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(e).

During the period on appeal, the Veteran has been seen for several VA examinations. The first examination was in October 2015. The results of the examination are as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg

RIGHT	10	40	55	50	40

LEFT	10	55	55	60	45

The speech discrimination scores in his right and left ears were 92% and 84% respectively. See October 2015 C&P Exam. As not all frequencies are at 55 decibels or higher, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 do not apply. 

Based on the results of the examination, the Veteran's right ear has Level I hearing in his right ear and Level II hearing in his left ear. Applying these scores to Table VII, the combination of hearing loss equates to a noncompensable, or zero percent, disability rating, which was assigned by the AOJ.

The next examination was on October 1, 2021. The results of the examination are as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg

RIGHT	50	60	75	70	64

LEFT	50	100	85	100	84

The speech discrimination scores in his right and left ears were 42% and 36% respectively. See October 2021 C&P Exam. The Board that as not all frequencies are at 55 decibels or higher, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 do not apply.

Based on the results of the audiometric examination, the Veteran's right ear has Level IX hearing per Table VA, and Level X hearing in his left ear. Taking these scores and applying them to Table VII, the combination of Level IX and Level X hearing equates to a 70 percent disability rating effective October 1, 2021, which was assigned by the AOJ. October 1, 2021, is the proper date of award as it is when the increase in severity became factually discernable. In this regard, the VA medical evidence is silent for complaints of worsened hearing prior to this date, and there are no audiological findings which would show a factually ascertainable worsening.

The Board has considered the Veteran's reports above and the information about the Veteran's hearing difficulties from his VA treatment records. However, these difficulties are measured by the audiometric testing and are accounted for in the applicable disability ratings. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017). As the assignment of a disability rating for hearing impairment is derived by mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometry evaluations are rendered, there is no doubt as to the proper evaluations to be assigned.

The October 1, 2021, audiometric testing is the most persuasive and probative evidence as to when there was an increase in severity of the Veteran's hearing loss disability. For the foregoing reasons, the evidence is persuasively against a compensable rating prior to October 1, 2021, and a disability rating in excess of 70 percent as of that date for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss. As such, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 60 percent for chronic fatigue syndrome is denied. 

The Veteran contends that his CFS warrants a disability rating in excess of 60 percent. See January 2024 VA Form 10182. For the reasons below, the Board disagrees.

The Veteran's CFS is rated at 60 percent under DC 6354. Pursuant to the relevant diagnostic criteria, a 60 percent evaluation is assigned for symptoms which are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities to less than 50 percent of the pre-illness level; or which wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least six weeks total duration per year.

A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms which are nearly constant and so severe as to restrict routine daily activities almost completely and which may occasionally preclude self-care.

A note to Diagnostic Code 6354 provides that, for the purpose of rating chronic fatigue syndrome, the condition will be considered incapacitating only while it requires bed rest and treatment by a physician. 38 C.F.R. § 4.88b.

In April 2015, the Veteran submitted a written statement detailing the extent of the symptoms he experiences. He reported a recurring low-grade fever, muscle aches and weakness, joint aches and pain, and the feeling "very bad" and "really tired" after physical exertion. This tiredness would sometimes last for a full day. 

At a March 2019 Board hearing, the Veteran reported daytime fatigue and weakness. Additionally, he claimed that he is "weak all the time" and "tired all the time," as well as "confused all the time." He stated that he has occasional memory problems which he attributed to his CFS. 

In December 2020 the Veteran reported to his non-VA healthcare provider that he was "tired all the time," but the submitted medical record provided no additional context. See June 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

In a May 2021 examination for housebound status, the Veteran reported being able to regularly, albeit in a very controlled manner, leave his home. This includes doing school runs with his children, taking short walks, and going to church. 

In October 2021 the Veteran was seen for a VA examination to determine the severity of his CFS. At the time, the Veteran's condition manifested as muscle weakness, migratory joint pain, neuropsychologic symptoms, forgetfulness, dizziness, inability to concentrate, prolonged fatigue after increase activity, and recurring low-grade fever. This fatigue was considered debilitating. The Veteran also reported headaches, which are rated separately and are discussed above. Overall, the examiner found that the Veteran's symptoms restrict his routine daily activities to less than 50 percent of his pre-illness levels. However, the Veteran did not need continuous medication to control his CFS, nor are there any periods of incapacitation.

The Board has taken the Veteran's lay statements into consideration. By the Veteran's own admission, he is capable of running errands and engaging in activities outside of the home, such as attending religious services. This, combined with the medical evidence of-record, shows that while the Veteran's abilities are diminished, the symptoms do not meet the criteria for a 100 percent rating. His symptoms are not nearly constant, nor are they so severe as to restrict routine daily activities almost completely. 

Finally, there is no evidence of any periods of incapacitation, which as described above are periods of bed rest and treatment prescribed by a physician. The Board is aware that the Veteran does experience further limitations in his daily life. However, these are accounted for by other disabilities. For example, the Veteran does occasionally need assistance bathing and tending to personal hygiene, yet this is due to his degenerative arthritis and not his CFS. See May 2021 VA 21-2680 Examination for Housebound Status. While diminished, the Veteran's apparent remaining capability mitigates against an award of a 100 percent rating.

Thus, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively shows that his CFS symptoms are consistent with a 60 percent rating, but no higher. As such, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's claim is denied.

3. Entitlement to separate evaluations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnea, currently evaluated together is denied.

The Veteran is requesting that the Board award separate disability ratings for his COPD and OSA. See January 2024 VA Form 10182. 

As an initial matter, the Board is precluded from separating the disability ratings for COPD and OSA as a matter of law. A single rating will be assigned under the DC which reflects the predominant disability with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(a); see also Urban v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 82, 89, 90-91 (2017).

However, as discussed below, even if the Board could separate the Veteran's ratings, splitting the existing disability rating and assigning separate ratings for the conditions would potentially deprive the Veteran of ancillary benefits, such as SMC, and could lead to a lower combined disability evaluation. Therefore, the Veteran's claim is denied. 

The Veteran's COPD and OSA are rated together as there is a significant overlap in symptoms. For example, in the January 2023 rating decision, the AOJ noted that Veteran's COPD required breathing assistance, which was treated by his continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine which also treated his OSA.

A review of the claims file indicates that the two conditions have been intertwined. In a letter submitted to VA in April 2015, the Veteran testified that he was told his OSA was exacerbated by acute respiratory failure, which was either directly or indirectly caused or aggravated by his COPD. The Veteran reiterated this information at his March 2019 Board hearing. 

In April 2016, a VA examiner determined that the Veteran's other pulmonary conditions were relevant to the severity of his OSA, and how it was to be treated.

At his March 2019 Board hearing, the Veteran explained that he has to "take a lot of breathing treatments." See March 2019 Hearing Transcript. This included using a nebulizer at least three times a day, on top of needing to use the CPAP machine. In support of this testimony the Veteran provided several medical articles, such as one from UC San Diego indicating that there is an overlap in OSA and COPD symptoms. 

In May 2019, the Veteran sought non-VA treatment for his OSA and COPD simultaneously. See May 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. The non-VA treatment provider noted that the Veteran's OSA has many comorbidities, including COPD. 

In February 2020 the Veteran submitted a respiratory condition disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) regarding his COPD. While the Veteran's symptoms did wax and wane, he did require two hospitalizations in 2019 for pneumonia. He experienced chest pain, shortness of breath, and wheezing. Furthermore, the Veteran required two intermittent courses or bursts of systemic corticosteroids in the 12 months prior to the examination. 

An October 2021 VA examination had substantially similar findings, noting a history of systemic corticosteroids being necessary and the daily use of inhalational bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory medication. While additional oxygen therapy was not necessary, it was noted that the Veteran's CPAP machine did allow for the administration of additional oxygen. 

In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a written statement, wherein he acknowledged both his OSA and COPD caused difficulties breathing. See October 2022 VA Form 21-4138.

In sum, the evidence of-record shows that there is overlap between the symptoms of the Veteran's OSA and COPD. In such cases, there are VA regulations that prohibit rating the same symptom[s] more than once. The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as "pyramiding," must be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. Separate ratings may be permitted so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. Id. 

In layman's terms, VA cannot assign a rating for the Veteran's COPD based on difficulty breathing, and then take his difficulty breathing into account when assigning a rating for his OSA - in that instance, his difficulty breathing would already be accounted for by his COPD rating. 

Turning to the Veteran's COPD and OSA, the Board notes that, separately, he would have lower individual ratings and could lose ancillary SMC benefits from not having a single disability rated at 100%. 

For example, the Veteran's COPD is rated under DC 6604, where a 10 percent evaluation is warranted where a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) indicates one of the following: Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV-1) of 71 to 80 percent predicted; a ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in one second to Forced Vital Capacity (FEV-1/FVC) of 71 to 80 percent; or Diffusion Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide by the Single Breath Method (DLCO (SB)) of 66 to 80 percent predicted. 

A 30 percent evaluation is warranted where a PFT indicates one of the following: FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted; FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent; or DLCO (SB) of 56 to 65 percent predicted. 

A 60 percent evaluation is warranted where a PFT indicates one of the following: FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent; DLCO (SB) of 40 to 55 percent predicted; or maximum oxygen consumption of 15 to 20 ml/kg/min (with cardiorespiratory limit). 

A 100 percent evaluation is warranted where a respiratory disability manifests one of the following: FEV-1 less than 40 percent of predicted value; FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent; DLCO (SB) less than 40 percent predicted; maximum exercise capacity less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption (with cardiac or respiratory limitation); cor pulmonale (right heart failure); right ventricular hypertrophy; pulmonary hypertension (shown by Echo or cardiac catheterization); episode(s) of acute respiratory failure; or a requirement for outpatient oxygen therapy.

When evaluating based on PFTs, post-bronchodilator results are used in applying the evaluation criteria in the rating schedule unless the post-bronchodilator results were poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results. In those cases, use the pre-bronchodilator values for rating purposes. When there is disparity between the results of different PFTs so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, the Board uses the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflect the level of disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(5), (6).

During the period on appeal the Veteran has undergone several PFTs. The first, in February 2020, showed a pre-bronchodilator FEV-1 of 37% and FEV-1/FVC of 69%, with no post-bronchodilator predictions. The examiner noted that the Veteran could not complete the dest due to "constant coughing." See February 2020 C&P Exam. As noted above, the Veteran needed daily inhalational medications but did not need additional oxygen therapy, other than his CPAP. 

The next PFT was done in September 2021. The FEV-1 and FEV-1/FVC scores were exactly the same as the February 2020 results. See October 2021 C&P Exam. 

However, as there are no post-bronchodilator PFT results, and the pre-bronchodilator results are not normal, it is unclear if the Veteran's condition would warrant a 100 percent rating, of if the use of bronchodilators would raise his FEV-1 and FEV-1/FVC scores to the levels warranting a 60 percent rating given that his PFT results are on the margin between a 60 percent rating and a 100 percent rating. 

Turning to the Veteran's OSA, it is rated under DC 6847. Under DC 6847, obstructive, central, or mixed, provides for a noncompensable (zero percent) rating for an asymptomatic sleep apnea syndrome but with documented sleep disorder breathing. Persistent daytime hypersomnolence warrants a 30 percent rating. Sleep apnea syndromes requiring use of a breathing assistance device such as continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine warrants a 50 percent rating. Chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale; or requirement of tracheostomy warrants a 100 percent rating.

Here, the Veteran's medical records show that he treats his condition with a CPAP machine. See April 2016 C&P Exam; see also October 2021 C&P Exam. Due to the use of the CPAP machine, the Veteran's OSA would warrant a 50 percent rating. A higher 100 percent rating would not be awarded as there is no evidence of chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, or requirement of a tracheostomy. 

However, even if there was evidence of chronic respiratory failure, those symptoms would be encompassed by his COPD diagnosis, and therefore would either be used to rate his COPD or his OSA, but not both, due to the prohibitions against pyramiding. 

Given that there is overlap between the Veteran's COPD and OSA symptoms, the prohibition against pyramiding would lead to lower individual and combined ratings. Based on the above, the Board finds that, if rated separately, the most likely outcome would be a 60 percent rating for his COPD and a 50 percent rating for his OSA. In the Veteran's instant case, a 60 percent rating for the Veteran's COPD and 50 percent rating for his OSA would equal a combined 80 percent disability rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.

Finally, in the simplest terms, it is in the Veteran's best interest that he maintains a single disability rated at 100 percent rather than several disabilities with lower individual ratings. Having a single disability with a 100 percent rating allows for the award of ancillary benefits that may otherwise be unavailable. 

In sum, the Board finds that the combined rating for his COPD and OSA best encapsulates the severity of the Veteran's breathing difficulties and treating them as a single disability for rating purposes is the proper course of action. 

The Veteran's claim for separate ratings for his OSA and COPD is denied, and a 100 percent rating for the two conditions treated as a single disability (for rating purposes) is maintained.

4. Entitlement to a higher rate of special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114 is denied.

The Veteran is requesting increased SMC benefits generally, and SMC benefits under subsection (o) of 38 U.S.C. § 1114 specifically. However, as addressed below, the Veteran does not meet the requirements for the award, and his claim must be denied.

SMC is a special statutory award in addition to awards based on the schedular evaluations provided in VA's rating schedule. Claims for SMC, other than those pertaining to one-time awards and an annual clothing allowance, are governed by 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114 (k)-(s) and 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350 and 3.352. In this regard, the rate amounts increase the later in the alphabet the letter appears (except for the (s) rate). SMC under subsections (k) through (r) are rates that are paid in addition to any other SMC rates, with certain monetary limits.

At the time the most recent period on appeal closed, the Veteran was receiving SMC compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 subsection (p) and 38 C.F.R. § 2.250(f)(3) at a rate "intermediate between subsection (l) and subsection (m)." See June 2023 Rating Decision - Codesheet.

As relevant to the Veteran's claim, SMC at the (l) rate is payable when the Veteran, due to service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet or one hand and one foot, or is blind in both eyes, or is permanently bedridden or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b).

SMC at the (m) rate is warranted if the Veteran, as a result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands, or of both legs at a level, or with complications, preventing natural knee action with prosthesis in place, or of one arm and one leg at levels; or with complications, preventing natural elbow and knee action with prosthesis in place, or has suffered blindness in both eyes having only light perception; or has suffered blindness in both eyes, rendering such Veteran so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(m); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(c).

SMC at the (n) rate is payable for: (1) anatomical loss or loss of use of both arms at a level, or with complications, preventing natural elbow action with prosthesis in place; (2) anatomical loss of both legs so near the hip as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance; (3) anatomical loss of one arm and one leg so near the shoulder and hip as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance; or (4) anatomical loss of both eyes or blindness without light perception in both eyes. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(n); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(d).

The Veteran does not have any loss or loss of use as contemplated under the provisions of SMC (m) or (n), and therefore rating directly under those subsections would be improper, and are thus denied.

The provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p) provide for "intermediate" SMC rates between the different subsections based on anatomical loss or loss of use of the extremities or blindness in connection with deafness and/or loss or loss of use of a hand or foot. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f). In addition to the statutory rates payable under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) through (n) and the intermediate or next-higher rate provisions set forth under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p), an additional single permanent disability independently ratable at 100 percent apart from any consideration of individual unemployability will afford entitlement to the next-higher statutory rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 or if already entitled to an intermediate rate to the next higher intermediate rate, but in no event higher than the (o) rate. The single permanent disability independently ratable at 100 percent must be separate and distinct and involve different anatomical segments or bodily systems from the conditions establishing entitlement under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) through (n) or the intermediate rate provisions outlined above. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(4).

In this case, in a February 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was found entitled to payment of SMC (l) for requiring the need of aid and attendance due to, as relevant, COPD and OSA, degenerative arthritis of the spine (which includes radiculopathies), IBS, and gout. See January 2020 VA Form 21-2680, Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance.

Other than those accounted for as the basis of the subsection (l) rating, the Veteran is also service-connected for bilateral hearing loss at 70 percent as of October 2021, CFS rated as 60 percent, pes planus rated as 30 percent, tension headaches rated as 30 percent, an adjustment disorder rated as 30 percent, dry eye syndrome rated as 10 percent, tinnitus rated as 10 percent, and noncompensable sinusitis, rhinitis, incontinence, and erectile dysfunction.

He is rated at the level of SMC (p) due to these disabilities equaling at least 50 percent. In order to get a higher rating, the disabilities must equal a separate 100 percent rating. Importantly, and again, they must be separate and distinct and involve different anatomical segments or bodily systems from the conditions establishing entitlement under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l). 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(4).

Initially, the Veteran's COPD and OSA cannot be considered separate from his CFS when determining the effects of his disabilities. In essence, there is significant overlap of symptoms, and assigning treating them as distinct is barred by the rules against pyramiding as discussed above. For example, at his February 2020 VA examination for respiratory conditions, it was noted that the symptoms of the Veteran's COPD included "difficulty exerting himself for most any activity," and that "[a]ny exertion causes shortness of breath which requires him to rest." See February 2020 C&P Exam. In October 2021, a VA examiner noted that the Veteran's CFS was productive of "debilitating fatigue" (among other symptoms) and the Veteran reported "fatigue following any increases in his daily activities." See October 2021 C&P Exam. Lastly, CFS is service connected noted as "associated" with COPD. Thus, the CFS cannot be considered in whether a separate 100 percent rating is warranted.

Likewise, the Veteran was noted to have gout as part of the reason for the need for aid and attendance. Importantly, his pes planus is noted as claimed as and resulting in "feet pain." Therefore, his foot pain from his pes planus is considered under the rating for the need for aid and attendance.

Using the combined ratings table, the remaining disabilities then amount to a total of 88 percent, which would be rounded to 90 percent. Unfortunately, another intermediate step under subsection (p) requires disabilities separate and distinct rated as 100 percent disabling. Therefore, a higher level of SMC under subsection (p) is denied.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to SMC under subsection (o) due to loss of sphincter and bladder control. In this regard, paralysis of both lower extremities together with the loss of anal and bladder sphincter control will entitle a veteran to the (o) rate of SMC, through the combination of loss of use of both legs and helplessness. The requirement of loss of anal and bladder sphincter control is met even though incontinence has been overcome under a strict regimen of rehabilitation of bowel and bladder training and other auxiliary measures. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e)(2).

Here, the Veteran does not have paralysis of both his lower extremities combined with loss of anal and bladder sphincter control. The Board notes that the Veteran's medical records show a history of urinary incontinence and irritable bowel syndrome, but not to the level that either condition qualifies as a loss of sphincter control. See October 2021 C&P Exams; see also May 2021 VA Form 21-2680.

Likewise, the Veteran did not have anatomical loss of both arms or blindness as required to warrant SMC (o) under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e)(1)(i), (iii), or (iv). Nor did he suffer disability which would entitle such him to two or more of the rates provided in one or more subsections (l) through (n), with no condition being considered twice, for SMC (o). In this regard, the only conditions which entitled him to SMC ratings are already considered under the rating for SMC (l), and he does not contend nor does the record show that he would otherwise be rendered so helpless by the remaining disabilities to require regular aid and attendance.

Given this, the Veteran does not meet the criteria for an (o) rate of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(e).

Finally, to be eligible for SMC under subsection (r), the Veteran must otherwise be entitled to compensation under subsection (o), at the maximum rate authorized under subsection (p), or at the intermediate rate authorized between the rates authorized under subsections (n) and (o) and at the rate authorized under subsection (k). As above, these prerequisite SMC levels are not present, and thus SMC (r) is not warranted.

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's condition. However, as he does not meet the regulatory criteria, the evidence persuasively weighs against him, and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 4.3.

The Veteran's claim is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for tension headaches is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his headaches warrant a disability rating in excess of 30 percent. See January 2024 VA Form 10182. Upon review of the record, a remand is necessary in order to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error to obtain an examination which adequately discounts the ameliorative effects of medication.

The Veteran's headaches are rated under DC 8100. Under DC 8100, a 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months. A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

In March 2019, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing that he "sometimes" gets migraines, which are made worse by bright lights. When he gets them, he needs to "lay down and ... just need to rest." See March 2019 Hearing Transcript.

In February 2020 the Veteran was seen for a VA examination to determine the nature and severity of his headaches. The examiner diagnosed him with acute intermittent tension headaches, with an onset of around 2015 (though the Veteran reported symptoms going back to the 1980s). There was no evidence of migraines or trauma. The Veteran said he got headaches 2-3 times per week and uses medications such as Tylenol for relief. At their worst, these headaches resulted in a pulsating or throbbing pain on both sides of the head that worsens with physical activity, with accompanying nausea and vomiting. These would last for less than a day. The Veteran also experienced headaches productive of characteristic prostrating attacks about once a month or less.

In June 2021 he submitted non-VA medical records, showing a history of treatment for several conditions, including headaches. Treatment records from May 2021 show that the Veteran's migraines are stable, and his medication had been switched from Topamax to Imitrex with apparently successful results. See June 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

In September 2021 the Veteran was seen for another VA examination to evaluate the severity of his headache disability. The diagnosis was unchanged from the prior VA examination. The Veteran reported experienced discomfort and bilateral, throbbing pain with accompanying photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and vision changes. However, the examiner found no evidence of characteristic prostrating attacks.

The examiner noted a review of the medication lists, and that he took over the counter Tylenol but no prescriptions. However, as noted above, the private treatment records show he was taking Topamax, but switched to Imitrex with apparent successful results merely 3 months prior to the VA examination. The Veteran was noted to have less symptomatology very shortly after switching medication, and that medication was not considered by the examiner. It is clear then, that the effects of such medication on the Veteran's headache disability were not considered by the VA examiner in describing the severity of the disability. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 62 (2012) (holding that the ameliorative effects of medication should not be considered in the severity of a disability unless specifically contemplated by the applicable rating criteria). Accordingly, remand is warranted to obtain additional VA examination to determine the severity of the Veteran's headache disability and correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of his headache disability during the appellate period on appeal. The entire claims file should be made available for review. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.

NOTE: In so opining, the examiner must not consider the ameliorative effects of any medications taken in the treatment of his disability.
