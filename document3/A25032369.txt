ORDER

Entitlement to the payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a February 2024 rating decision is granted.

Entitlement to the payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a March 2024 rating decision is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an August 2023 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied, inter alia, service connection for erectile dysfunction and a rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

2. In August 2023, the appellant and the Veteran filed a validly executed VA Form 21-22a and Fee Agreement.

3. In a September 2023 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, the appellant requested readjudication of, inter alia, the August 2023 rating decision's denial of service connection for erectile dysfunction and the denial of a rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD.

4. In a February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for erectile dysfunction, assigning a noncompensable rating.  The AOJ also awarded special monthly compensation (SMC) based on loss of use of creative organ.

5. In a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ increased the rating for the Veteran's PTSD from 50 percent to 70 percent.

6. The appellant is entitled to attorney fees based on the total award of past-due benefits granted in the February 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the February 2024 rating decision have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

2. The criteria for the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the March 2024 rating decision have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals from a pair of Fee Decisions, both dated March 2024, issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office.

In a March 2024 VA Form 10182, the appellant requested review of the March 2024 Fee Decisions under the Board's direct review docket.  Under direct review, a Board decision is based on the evidence at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a hearing or accept additional evidence into the record in its direct review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Accordingly, the Board may only consider evidence of record as of March 22, 2024, the date of the decisions on appeal.

Procedural Requirements

The Board notes that a claim for attorney fees constitutes a contested claim and, therefore, is subject to special procedural requirements.  See Mason v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 1 (2012).

Specifically, under applicable criteria, upon the filing of a notice of disagreement (NOD) in a contested claim, all interested parties are to be furnished a copy of the substance of the NOD, including the type of review requested.  38 C.F.R. § 20.403.  Thereafter, the non-appealing party has 30 days within which to file a brief, argument, or request a different type of review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.404.

Here, in a May 2024 correspondence, the Veteran was notified that the appellant had submitted a VA Form 10182 regarding entitlement to attorney fees, that the appellant had requested review under the Board's direct review docket, and notified the Veteran of the 30-day window within which to file a brief, argument, or request a different type of review.  The Veteran was also provided a redacted copy of the March 2024 VA Form 10182, along with the argument submitted by the appellant therewith.  See May 2024 Board Correspondence.

Therefore, the Board finds that the procedural requirements with regard to contested claims have been met, and the Board may proceed with adjudication of this appeal.

Analysis

1. Entitlement to the payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a February 2024 rating decision is granted.

2. Entitlement to the payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a March 2024 rating decision is granted.

The appellant seeks attorney fees for representation provided in conjunction with rating decisions, dated February 2024 and March 2024, which resulted in awards of past-due benefits.

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.  To represent a claimant before VA, a representative must execute a power of attorney, on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative."

Agents or attorneys may charge claimants fees for representation once: (a) the agent or attorney has complied with regulatory power of attorney (POA) and fee agreement requirements; and (b) an AOJ has issued notice of an initial decision on a claim.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.631, 14.636.

An "initial decision on a claim" is the result of a valid appeal.  It includes an initial decision on a request to revise a prior decision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE), a decision on an initial claim for an increase in rate of benefit, or an initial decision on a supplemental claim.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Vet. Aff., 7 F4th 1110, 1138 (Fed. Cir. 2021), 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(1)(i).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).

Here, the appellant complied with the regulatory POA and fee agreement requirements.  Specifically, the appellant and the Veteran executed and filed a valid VA Form 21-22a and valid Fee Agreement in August 2023.  See August 2023 VA Form 21-22a; August 2023 Fee Agreement.  As such, the first element to establish eligibility for attorney fees has been met.

Further, the February 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions were issued in response to a September 2023 supplemental claim which sought readjudication of the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction and entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD.  In other words, the February 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions were the result of a valid appeal and, therefore, the second element to establish eligibility for attorney fees has been met.

Indeed, the Board notes that the March 2024 Fee Decisions' denials of attorney fees were not based on the lack of eligibility.  Instead, in both instances, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) found that, as the Veteran had an existing debt to the United States Government, pursuant to a VA Office of General Counsel Precedent Opinion, the entire amount of the past-due benefits would be used towards such debt, leaving no past-due benefits from which to award attorney fees.  See Vet. Aff. Op. Gen. Couns. Prec. 12-93, VAOPGCPREC 12-93 (1993).  In other words, the AOJ determined that, as no past-due benefits were available to be paid to the Veteran, there were no past-due benefits from which to pay any award of attorney fees.

However, attorney fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded, regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In short, though the Veteran's payment of past-due benefits was reduced as payment towards a debt, attorney fees should have been awarded based on the total amount of past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran.  As such, payment of attorney fees as specified in the Fee Agreement is warranted and the appeal is granted.
