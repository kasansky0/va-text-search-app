DOCKET NO. 240913-472886
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU is moot because a 100 percent disability rating for a single disability and special monthly compensation at the housebound rate has been granted throughout the period on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to a TDIU have been satisfied.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1975 to February 1981.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that while the period to change AMA dockets per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not elapsed, a docket switch waiver letter (see Williams v. McDonough, 7 Vet. App. 305 (2024)) is not necessary because this appeal is being dismissed as moot.

Entitlement to a TDIU is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  VA received the Veteran's claim for a TDIU on October 26, 2023.  In an August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for small cell lung cancer with a 100 percent disability evaluation, as well as special monthly compensation at the housebound rate.  These grants are effective August 12, 2023, prior to his application for a TDIU and prior to his last day of work.  See October 2023 VA 21-8940 (Application for Increase Compensation Based on Individual Unemployability); January 2024 VA Form 21-4192 (Request for Employment Information).  Because a 100 percent disability evaluation for a single disability and accompanying special monthly compensation has been granted throughout the period on appeal, there is no remaining question of fact or law with respect to the issue of whether a TDIU is warranted during the period on appeal.  Accordingly, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is dismissed as moot.
