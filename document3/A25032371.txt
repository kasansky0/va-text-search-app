ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of July 30, 2015, for the award of total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 30, 2015, for the award of a TDIU is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Since July 30, 2015, the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with her education, skills, and work experience as a result of her service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Since July 30, 2015, the criteria for entitlement to a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.15, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 2000 to June 2003.  

This matter is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The May 2021 rating decision was a Higher-Level Review decision that considered the evidence of record at the time of a previous decision by the RO in December 2020.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(a), 3.2601.  In the July 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed the portion of the rating decision pertaining to the issue above and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 30, 2015, for the award of a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  

1. Effective Date for Entitlement to a TDIU

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

By way of background, a June 2019 rating decision granted entitlement to a TDIU effective September 16, 2016, the date of receipt of the application for unemployability.  The Veteran submitted a timely appeal in December 2019 to the Board.  

An October 2020 Board decision denied the Veteran's claim for an effective date of July 30, 2014, for entitlement to a TDIU.  The decision noted that the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a TDIU was part and parcel of an increased rating claim for right hip since the receipt of the July 30, 2014, intent to file a claim.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 455 (2009).  

The Veteran then submitted a November 2020 supplemental claim application seeking an earlier effective date for entitlement to a TDIU, which was denied in a December 2020 rating decision.  In February 2021, the Veteran submitted a request for a higher-level review and sought review of the December 2020 decision.  A December 2021 higher level review decision, the decision on appeal, again denied an earlier effective date for entitlement to a TDIU.  After the October 2020 Board decision, the Veteran has since been awarded service connection for osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine in a January 2021 rating decision, and service connection for bilateral shin splints in a December 2021 rating decision.  

Once a decision on a claim becomes final, it cannot be challenged through a freestanding claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date.  See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 300 (2006).  However, under Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an effective date can be based on the date a claim was first submitted, if the issue is continuously pursued through one of the administrative review avenues.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Thus, a Board decision is not final if the Veteran submits a supplemental claim within one year of that decision, and the claim may still be considered to be continuously pursued.  See Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96 (2024).  As the Veteran submitted a timely supplemental claim after October 2020 Board Decision, the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for a TDIU is properly on appeal.  

The question before the Board is whether the Veteran is entitled to an effective date earlier than September 16, 2016, for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU.  

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id.  

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3)disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table).  

VA will grant a total rating for compensation purposes based on unemployability when the evidence shows a veteran is precluded from obtaining or maintaining any gainful employment consistent with her education and occupational experience, by reason of her service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability."  Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).  In arriving at a conclusion, consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to her age or the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.  

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  Id.  The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment.  Id.  Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity).  Id.  As "sedentary" is defined as "[r]equiring or marked by much sitting <a sedentary desk job>" the Board finds that sedentary employment is a job where the worker primarily sits down.  Webster's II New College Dictionary 999 (1999).  

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training.  See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014).  It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability.  Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  The ultimate question is whether they are capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).  

As noted above, entitlement to a TDIU has been granted effective September 16, 2016.  The Veteran has also been in receipt of a combined 100 percent evaluation since June 13, 2016.  Thus, the issue pertains to whether entitlement to a TDIU is warranted for the period prior to June 13, 2016.  

Prior to June 13, 2016, the Veteran has the following disabilities that are service connected: depressive disorder (rated 70 percent, from June 30, 2015); migraine headache (rated 50 percent, from August 14, 2014); osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine (rated 40 percent, from July 30, 2015); right shoulder degenerative joint disease (rated zero percent, from June 19, 2003); pseudotumor cerebri (rated 10 percent, from July 3, 2007); right hip osteoarthritis (rated zero percent prior to August 14, 2014, and 10 percent thereafter); optic atrophy of the left eye (rated 10 percent, from July 30, 2015); scar of the residual of status post right breast lumpectomy (rated zero percent, from June 19, 2003); chronic right ingrown toenail (rated zero percent, from June 19, 2003); right hip osteoarthritis with limitation of extension (rated zero percent, from August 14, 2014); and right hip osteoarthritis with limitation of flexion (rated zero percent, from August 14, 2014).  

Based on the forgoing, for the period from July 30, 2015, to June 13, 2016, the Veteran has at least one disability rated at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Accordingly, the Board may consider the claim for a TDIU on a schedular basis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted for the period from July 30, 2015, to June 13, 2016.  

Military personnel records reflect the Veteran's military occupation specialty (MOS)/rating was that of power generation equipment repairer.  On her September 2016 application for unemployability she reported her migraine, pseudo tumor cerebri, and right hip osteoarthritis prevent her from following a substantially gainful occupation.  The Veteran reported completing Bachelor of Arts degrees in psychology, and attended school from June 1, 2014, to September 10, 2016.  The record also indicates that the Veteran obtained a master's degree in clinical Mental Health Counseling in March 2019.  She reported she last worked full-time and became too disabled to work on September 19, 2013, as a customer service retention specialist.  The record also indicates that the Veteran also worked in law enforcement from September 2007 to June 201, car sales from June 2010 to August 2010, and customer service from July 2012 to June 1, 2014.  She also reported receiving a jail officer certification.  Regarding her education, she reported that she had to enroll in college in order to receive financial aid to support her family due to her inability to work.  She reported receiving accommodations from the college due to her service-connected disabilities that allowed her to be able to earn a degree.  

The Veteran submitted a September 2014 private disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ).  It was noted that the Veteran would have headaches 4 days out of a week and was hospitalized once in July 2014.  Her non-headache symptoms included nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, changes in vision, and diarrhea.  Her symptoms would impact the left side of her head and would last 4 hours to 2 days in duration.  The Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine headache pain that occur more frequently than once a month.  The Veteran had very frequent prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine headache pain.  The Veteran's non-migraine symptoms also result in prostrating attacks and would also result in very frequent prostrating and prolonged attacks.  Regarding the impact of the Veteran's headache condition on her ability to work, it was noted that the Veteran was frequently incapacitated due to her headaches.  

She submitted another September 2014 private DBQ for her hip.  The Veteran reported having flare-ups of her right hip.  She also reported functional loss described as inability to exercise or play sports, and inability to walk any distance to include more than one height of stairs without pain.  Functional loss of the right hip included excess fatigability, pain on movement, disturbance of locomotion, interference with sitting, and interference with standing.  Regarding the functional impact of the right hip on her ability to perform any type of occupational task, it was noted she is limited in her ability to stand, sit, or walk.  

The Veteran presented for an October 2016 VA headache examination.  She reported having worse headache over the years that occur more frequently and more intense.  She experienced headache pain and symptoms of constant head pain, pulsating or throbbing head pain, pain on both sides of the head, and pain worsens with physical activity.  She experienced non-headache symptoms associated with her headaches which included nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, changes to vision, and syncopal episodes.  Her symptoms last more than 2 days and typical impact both sides of her head.  She did not have characteristic attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain that occur once a month.  She had very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Regarding the functional impact of the Veteran's headache condition on her ability to work, it was noted that the Veteran's headache condition negatively impacts her ability to work due to the syncopal episodes associated with the headaches.  

The Veteran presented for a February 2017 VA examination for her right shoulder.  She reported current symptoms of constant pain with increasing intensity and frequency.  She reported flare-ups described as 10/10 pain.  She reported functional loss described as less range of motion.  Regarding the functional impact of the Veteran's right shoulder on her ability to work, it was noted that the Veteran had limited use of her right arm due to pain.  

She was afforded a March 2017 VA examination for her pseudotumor cerbrai.  Regarding the functional impact of the Veteran's condition on her ability to work, the Veteran reported that she is not working because of the combination of her migraines, depression with anxiety, and multiple other health problems.  

Treatment records are not in significant conflict with findings during VA examination.  For example, during a September 2016 VA treatment, the Veteran reported that she was not currently working due to her health issues.  She reported that she lost her job and income due to health and had not worked since 2014.  

During a July 2014 Vocational Rehabilitation report, it was noted that the Veteran was unemployed and had not overcome the vocational impairment.  It was also noted that the Veteran met the criteria for an employment handicap.  

Taken as a whole, for the period from July 30, 2015, to June 13, 2016, the Veteran's symptoms do suggest she was unable to obtain and maintain employment.  Entitlement to a TDIU is a legal determination, not a medical one.  Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Medical examiners may provide evidence regarding functional and occupational impairment, but the Board must decide whether a veteran may "secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" based on all evidence of record.  See Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 243 (2019).  Given the Veteran's education and work history, symptoms reported by the Veteran, and the level of functional impairment as reported by VA examiners and treatment providers the Board does consider this level of impairment as one that would preclude employment.  

The Board has considered the record where it is noted that the Veteran was last employed in June 2014.  She attended college from June 2014 until March 2019, where she obtained both a bachelor's degree and master's degree.  The Veteran's educational achievements may be indicative that despite the limitations from her service-connected disabilities, she was able to successfully maintain full time enrollment in school and eventually graduated with higher educational degrees.  The record such as a June 2018 VA treatment note also indicates that the Veteran started a new job in June 2018.  There was also indication that the Veteran obtained employment in May 2019 as a customer service representative, and a legal administrative specialist in July 2019.  

Of note, the Veteran reported that she left her job as a result of her service-connected disabilities.  While she attended school, it was noted that the Veteran needed accommodations that assisted with her ability to attain her educational goals.  Furthermore, while it appears the Veteran has since obtained employment in either 2018 or 2019, the relevant period on appeal in this case is from July 2015 to June 2016.  The Veteran's ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation is impacted by the effects of her service-connected disabilities.  The Veteran had characteristic and very frequent and prostrating migraine attacks that lasted from 4 days out of a week that impacted her ability to work.  She reported being hospitalized in July 2014 as a result of her condition.  It was noted that the Veteran would be frequently incapacitated due to her headaches.  During the October 2016 VA examination, it was noted that the Veteran had very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine and non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The Veteran would be impacted the syncopal episodes associated with her headaches.  

The Veteran also reported that her right hip would result in functional loss such as being unable to walk any distances to include more than one height of stairs without pain.  Her right hip manifested in excess fatigability, pain on movement, disturbance of locomotion, interference with sitting, and interference with standing.  It was noted that the Veteran's right hip would impact the Veteran's ability to perform any type of occupational tasks as a result of her limitation in standing, sitting, or walking.  

The Board has also considered the July 2014 vocational rehabilitation report where it was noted that the Veteran was unemployed and could not overcome the vocational impairment.  The Veteran also met the criteria for employment handicap.  

Given the forgoing, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that the service-connected disabilities preclude the Veteran from the ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with her education, skills, training, and work history, for the period from July 30, 2015, to June 13, 2016.  Accordingly, entitlement to a TDIU is warranted for the period from July 30, 2015, to June 13, 2016.  

 REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an Effective Date Earlier than July 30, 2015, for the Award of a TDIU is Remanded.

For the period prior to July 30, 2015, the Veteran does not meet the percentage standards set forth in § 4.16(a).  Therefore, the Board may not consider the claim for a TDIU in the first instance but will refer it to the Director, Compensation Service, if it is shown that the Veteran is unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  As described in Ray v. Wilkie, the correct standard for referral is whether there is "sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable by reason of his or her service-connected disabilities." 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019).  

As noted above, the July 2014 vocational rehabilitation report indicated that the Veteran was unemployed and could not overcome the vocational impairment.  It was also noted that the Veteran met the criteria for employment handicap.  Given the above, prior to the decision on appeal, the AOJ failed to refer the claim to the Director for extraschedular consideration under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b), which is an error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory duty.  This should have been done prior to adjudicating the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  Thus, a remand is warranted.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Refer the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a TDIU prior to July 30, 2015, to VA's Director of Compensation Services for extraschedular consideration.
