ORDER

Service connection for a left shoulder disability is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left shoulder disability is not secondarily related to a service-connected disability and is not otherwise related to an in-service event, injury, or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a left shoulder disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1987 to September 1991. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in December 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the August 19, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran referenced the December 2023 decision and elected the Board's Direct Review docket. Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of December 7, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after December 7, 2023, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. In order to establish entitlement to service connection, there must generally be 1) evidence of a current disability; 2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and 3) a causal connection between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. To substantiate a claim of secondary service connection there must be evidence of (1) a current chronic disability for which service connection is sought; (2) an already service-connected disability; and (3) that the already service-connected disability (a) caused or (b) aggravated the disability for which service connection is sought. See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable to his senses. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a). VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed Cir. 2009).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for his left shoulder disability as secondary to his right shoulder disability. 7/28/2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. Although the Veteran has only asserted entitlement to service connection on a secondary basis, the Board has considered all applicable theories of entitlement for service connection. 

The December 2023 rating decision included the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of left shoulder tendinitis. 12/7/2023 Rating Decision, p. 3. The Board finds no reason to disturb this favorable finding and, therefore, finds that the first element of service connection is established. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

With respect to the second element of direct service connection, that of an in-service event, injury, or disease, the Board finds that the competent and probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim. The Veteran's available service treatment records (STRs) and military personnel record do not contain complaints of or treatment for a left shoulder condition during service. See 11/18/2016 STR - Medical. Moreover, the Veteran has not asserted that he sustained any injury to his left shoulder while in service. As a result of these uncontradicted facts of record, the Board finds that service connection on a direct basis is not warranted.

With respect to secondary service connection, the Veteran has established that he has a current diagnosis of left shoulder tendinitis that he believes is related to his right shoulder disability. See VA Form 21-526EZ, p. 3. The Board notes a medical statement from a private medical doctor linking the Veteran's onset of left shoulder pain to compensation and dependence on the left upper extremity after the Veteran underwent right shoulder replacement. See 7/28/2023 Med. Treatment Record - Non-Gov't Facility, p. 2. 

The record does not currently reflect that the Veteran is service connected for a right shoulder disability. A November 2020 rating decision confirmed and continued a prior denial of service for a right shoulder disability. Furthermore, the Veteran has no service-connected disabilities from which he could seek secondary service connection for his left shoulder condition. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran cannot establish the necessary elements of secondary service connection because he is not service connected for a right shoulder disability and does not otherwise have any currently service-connected disabilities. Therefore, the Board finds that service connection on a secondary basis is not warranted.

In addition, after review of the competent and probative evidence of record, and in its responsibility to consider all theories of entitlement, the Board also finds that service connection on a presumptive basis has neither been raised by the Veteran nor raised by the record. See Schroder v. West, 212 F.3d 1265, 1271 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The Board, therefore, finds that service connection on a presumptive basis is not warranted.

?

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim and that the benefit-of the-doubt doctrine, therefore, is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). Accordingly, service connection for a left shoulder disability is denied.
