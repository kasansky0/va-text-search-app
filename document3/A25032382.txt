ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 1, 1994, for the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder is dismissed.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 1, 1994, for the award of service connection for kidney stones is dismissed.

The motion to revise or reverse, on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), a November 30, 1978, administrative decision finding that the Veteran's character of discharge was under dishonorable conditions for the purpose of eligibility for VA benefits and a bar to VA compensation benefits, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's request for effective dates prior to August 1, 1994, for the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder and kidney stones essentially constitute "freestanding" earlier effective date claims.

2. At the time of the November 30, 1978, administrative decision, there was conflicting evidence concerning the character of the Veteran's discharge.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The Veteran's freestanding claim seeking an effective date prior to August 1, 1994, for the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder lacks legal merit and is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.10; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

2. The Veteran's freestanding claim seeking an effective date prior to August 1, 1994, for the award of service connection for kidney stones lacks legal merit and is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.10; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

3. The November 30, 1978, administrative decision that found that the Veteran's character of discharge was under dishonorable conditions for the purpose of eligibility for VA benefits and a bar to VA compensation benefits did not contain CUE.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Navy from June 1972 to August 1973.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2020 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in this matter.

In April 2020, the Veteran, through his then-representative, submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the January 2020 decision.  In August 2020, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2020 decision.

In June 2021, the Veteran's then-representative submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) electing the Direct Review docket.  It was later discovered that the Veteran's representative had not been accredited to represent claimants before VA.  The pertinent regulation requires agents and attorneys to file an application for accreditation with VA's Office of General Counsel and receive notice of accreditation before providing representation.  38 C.F.R. §14.629(b).  Therefore, in December 2024, the Board sent the Veteran a letter informing him that his June 2021 VA Form 10182 was signed and submitted by someone other than him or an authorized representative.  The letter offered him the opportunity to appoint a new representative and requested that he submit a new VA Form 10182.  In December 2024, the Veteran appointed his current representative, and in February 2025, he submitted a new VA Form 10182, again electing the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2020 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Additionally, the Board notes that the RO, in addressing the Veteran's contentions as to CUE in the November 1978 administrative decision that adjudicated his character of discharge, also addressed the issues of earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder and kidney stones.  The Board notes that a motion seeking revision of a decision on the basis of CUE is completely separate from a claim seeking an earlier effective date for an award of disability compensation.  See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006).  Therefore, the CUE motion with respect to the November 1978 administrative decision and the appeal seeking earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder and kidney stones are addressed separately in this decision.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 1, 1994, for the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder 

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 1, 1994, for the award of service connection for kidney stones 

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a).  This statutory provision is implemented by VA regulation, which provides that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.?

Generally, the effective date for an award of service connection is the day after separation from service or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if the claim is received within one year of the date of separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).?

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has emphasized that an effective date cannot be challenged with a "freestanding" earlier effective date claim.  Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).  Rather, if a claimant wishes to obtain an effective date earlier than that assigned in a rating decision, the claimant must file a timely appeal to that decision awarding the benefit or, in the legacy system, submit new and material evidence within the one-year appeal period.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 20.201, 20.302.  Otherwise, the decision becomes final, and the only basis for challenging the effective date is a motion to revise the decision on the basis of CUE in the decision assigning the effective date, the reversal of which would result in an earlier effective date.  38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105; Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299.

In this case, by way of background, the Veteran initially submitted a claim seeking service connection for a nervous condition in July 1978.  In August 1978, the RO sent the Veteran a letter notifying him that he had received an other than honorable discharge from active service, and that it was therefore required to examine all relevant facts leading to his discharge to determine whether or not it was issued under conditions other than dishonorable.  The RO provided a copy of the regulation outlining the criteria on which character of discharge determinations were made and informed the Veteran that it had requested a copy of his discharge proceedings from the Military Department in which he served.  The letter informed the Veteran that he could obtain representation, without charge, and that he could request a personal hearing and submit evidence and argument in support of his claim.  The Veteran did not respond to the letter.

In November 1978, the RO issued an administrative decision in which it determined that the Veteran was discharged from service under dishonorable conditions and that this precluded payment of VA benefits.  VA notified the Veteran of this decision in a December 1978 notification letter.  The Veteran did not appeal that decision, and new and material evidence was not received by VA or constructively in its possession within one year of written notice to the Veteran of the decision.  Therefore, the decision became final.

The Veteran submitted additional claims of entitlement to service connection for a nervous condition in May 1982 and February 1991.  The RO denied both claims based on the Veteran's character of discharge.  In the May 1991 decision letter, the RO notified the Veteran of his right to file a request for revision of the character of his discharge with the Service Department Discharge Review Board or apply for correction of his military records by the Service Department Board for Correction of Military Records and included the DD form necessary for doing so.  The Veteran did not appeal the decisions, and they became final.

In April 1994, the Veteran submitted a claim of entitlement to service connection for schizophrenia and kidney stones, among other conditions.  In a May 1994 letter, the RO informed the Veteran that the claim was denied based on his character of discharge and again informed him of his right to request revision or correction of his military records.  In November 1994, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD) in response to the May 1994 decisional letter.

In September 1995, the Board for Correction of Naval Records approved a correction to the Veteran's DD Form 2014 to show that he was discharged under honorable conditions.

In February 1997, the RO issued a rating decision in which it denied service connection for a nervous condition and granted service connection for kidney stones effective October 5, 1995.

In April 1997, the RO issued another rating decision in which it granted service connection for kidney stones effective August 1, 1994, which represented the date of the Veteran's application for correction of his military record.  The Veteran did not appeal the effective date assigned for the award of service connection for kidney stones, and new and material evidence pertaining to that issue was not received by VA or constructively in its possession within one year of written notice to the Veteran of the April 1997 decision.  Therefore, with respect to the effective date of the award of service connection for kidney stones, the April 1997 rating decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). 

Later in April 1997, the RO issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) in which it continued to deny service connection for a nervous condition.  In response, in May 1997, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 9 Appeal to the Board.

In November 1997, the RO issued a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) in which it continued to deny service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disability.

In March 1998, while his appeal to the Board was pending, the RO issued a rating decision in which it granted service connection for schizoaffective disorder effective October 5, 1995.  The Veteran appealed the assigned rating, but not the effective date of the award.

In April 1998, the RO issued another rating decision in which it granted service connection for schizoaffective disorder effective August 1, 1994, which represented the date of the Veteran's application for correction of his military record.  The Veteran did not appeal the effective date assigned for the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder, and new and material evidence pertaining to that issue was not received by VA or constructively in its possession within one year of written notice to the Veteran of the April 1998 decision.  Therefore, with respect to the effective date of the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder, the April 1998 rating decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

In November 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim listing schizoaffective disorder and kidney stones.  In a January 2020 letter, the Veteran and his spouse indicated the Veteran was seeking earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder and kidney stones.

After careful review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran's claims for effective dates prior to August 1, 1994, for the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder and kidney stones amount to freestanding effective date claims, which are subject to dismissal.  If a claimant disagrees with the effective date assigned in a given rating action, the claimant must submit an appeal or request review of the decision within one year of notice of the rating decision assigning the effective date.  A "freestanding" effective date claim is a claim that seeks an earlier effective date for an award where the decision that assigned the effective date for that award has already become final.  As noted above, the Court has held that once a decision assigning an effective date becomes final, that assignment cannot be challenged through a freestanding claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date.  Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299-300.  In Rudd, the Court explained that to allow freestanding effective date claims would vitiate the rule of finality.  Id.  The Board is therefore required to dismiss freestanding claims for entitlement to earlier effective dates.  Id; see also DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52 (2006) (stating there is no such procedure as a freestanding challenge to the finality of a VA decision).

In reaching this conclusion, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's representative's contention, made in written argument received in February 2025, that an earlier effective date for kidney stones was warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) based on a service treatment record (STR) uploaded to the claims file in December 2014 that showed a calculus in the lower pole of the left kidney.  Section 3.156(c) provides an exception to the general rules governing finality.  As previously discussed, generally, a decision of the RO becomes final if the appellant does not express disagreement or submit new and material evidence within one year.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.105(b), 3.156(b), 3.160(d).  However, an exception to this general rule regarding finality arises under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), which provides that if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of the same section (which defines new and material evidence).  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c).  By operation of § 3.156(c), an original claim is not just reopened, it is reconsidered and serves as the date of the claim and the earliest date for which benefits may be granted.  Stowers v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 550, 554 (2014).  The Board finds that § 3.156(c) is not applicable because review of the February 1997 rating decision that initially awarded service connection for kidney stones shows that the RO at the time considered the Veteran's STRs and specifically mentioned the STR showing a calculus in the lower pole of the left kidney in awarding service connection at that time; therefore, as the record was already associated with the claims file when VA decided the claim in 1997, § 3.156(c) is not for application.

The Board also acknowledges the Veteran's representative's contentions that earlier effective dates are warranted based on evidence that the Veteran had kidney stones and symptoms of schizoaffective disorder in service.  However, as discussed above, an April 1997 rating decision awarded service connection for kidney stones effective August 1, 1994, and an April 1998 rating decision awarded service connection for schizoaffective disorder effective August 1, 1994.  The Veteran did not appeal the effective dates assigned for the award of service connection for those disabilities, and new and material evidence pertaining to those issues was not received by VA or constructively in its possession within one year of written notice to the Veteran of the decisions.  Therefore, with respect to the effective date of the award of service connection for kidney stones and schizoaffective disorder, the April 1997 and April 1998 rating decisions became final.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  To the extent the Veteran seeks earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for kidney stones and schizoaffective disorder, where the rating decisions that assigned the effective dates for those awards have become final, his claims constitute "freestanding" effective date claims and must be dismissed.  The only basis for challenging the effective date in such a situation is a motion to revise, on the basis of CUE, the decision assigning the effective date, the reversal of which would result in an earlier effective date.  38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105; Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299.

Ultimately, the Veteran's claims for earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for kidney stones and schizoaffective disorder constitute freestanding effective date claims and must be dismissed.  Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296.  The Board regrets that it cannot render a favorable decision in this matter.  However, while it is sympathetic to the Veteran, the Board is bound by the law and is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis.  See Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994).?

3. Whether there was CUE in a November 1978 administrative decision that adjudicated the Veteran's character of discharge for VA purposes

The Veteran contends that the RO committed CUE in a November 30, 1978, administrative decision in which it determined that the Veteran was discharged from his period of active service under dishonorable conditions, and that this precluded payment of VA benefits.  In reaching this decision, the RO noted that the Veteran had received an other than honorable discharge from service in August 1973.  The Veteran contends this was CUE because, while his DD 214 at the time reflected an other than honorable discharge, this was erroneous, as there was unambiguous evidence in his service records that he was in fact discharged under honorable conditions.

CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error."? It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.? Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE.? Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error."? Fugo v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?40, 43-44 (1993).? In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different.? Id. at 44.?

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).? For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision.? Id.?

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered.? Evans v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3?Vet. App.?310, 313-14 (1992).?

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision.? See Porter v. Brown, 5?Vet. App.?233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999).? A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset.? King v. Shinseki, 26?Vet. App.?433, 441 (2014).? The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different.? Id. at 442.?

As explained above, the review for CUE in a prior rating decision is based on the record and the law that existed when that decision was made.  Thus, the RO's failure to consider evidence that was not of record at the time of the rating decision being attacked is not generally the basis for reversal or revision of a decision on the basis of CUE.

As a threshold matter, the Board finds that the arguments advanced by the Veteran allege CUE with the requisite specificity.  See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003).  The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of his claim.

The Veteran initially submitted a claim seeking service connection for a nervous condition in July 1978.  In August 1978, the RO sent the Veteran a letter notifying him that he had received an other than honorable discharge from active service, and that it was therefore required to examine all relevant facts leading to his discharge to determine whether or not it was issued under conditions other than dishonorable.  The RO provided a copy of the regulation outlining the criteria on which character of discharge determinations were made and informed the Veteran that it had requested a copy of his discharge proceedings from the Military Department in which he served.  The letter informed the Veteran that he could obtain representation, without charge, and that he could request a personal hearing and submit evidence and argument in support of his claim.  The Veteran did not respond to the letter.

In November 1978, the RO issued the administrative decision at issue, in which it determined that the Veteran was discharged from service under dishonorable conditions and that this precluded payment of VA benefits.  The RO noted that the Veteran had received an other than honorable discharge in August 1973 and explained that military personnel records showed that he was guilty of offenses involving willful and persistent misconduct.  The RO cited multiple instances of such misconduct that were documented in his record.  VA notified the Veteran of this decision in a December 1978 notification letter.  The Veteran did not appeal the decision, and new and material evidence was not received by VA or constructively in its possession within one year of written notice to the Veteran of the decision.  Therefore, the decision became final.

At the time of the November 30, 1978, administrative decision, as now, eligibility for VA benefits was governed by statutory and regulatory law that defined an individual's legal status as a veteran of active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101(2), 101(24) (1976); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.6 (1978).

The term "veteran" meant "a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released there from under conditions other than dishonorable."  38 U.S.C. § 101(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(d).  A discharge or release from active service under conditions other than dishonorable was a prerequisite to entitlement to VA pension or compensation benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 101(18); 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(a).  The designation of the discharge as honorable by the service department was binding on VA as to character of discharge.  38 C.F.R. § 3.12(a).

Benefits were not payable where the former service member was discharged or released under one of the following conditions: (1) as a conscientious objector who refused to perform military duty, wear the uniform, or comply with lawful order of competent military authorities; (2) by reason of the sentence of a general court-martial; (3) resignation by an officer for the good of the service; (4) as a deserter; (5) as an alien during a period of hostilities, where it was affirmatively shown that the former service member requested his or her release; and (6) by reason of a discharge under other than honorable conditions issued as a result of an absence without official leave (AWOL) for a continuous period of at least 180 days (with specified exceptions to this condition).  See 38 U.S.C. § 3103(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(c).

A discharge or release because of one of the following offenses was considered to have been issued under dishonorable conditions: (1) acceptance of a discharge under other than honorable conditions or its equivalent in lieu of trial by general court-martial; (2) mutiny or spying; (3) an offense involving moral turpitude; and (4) willful and persistent misconduct.  The regulation specified that this included a discharge under other than honorable conditions, if it was determined to have been issued because of willful and persistent misconduct.  A discharge because of a minor offense would not, however, be considered willful and persistent misconduct if service was otherwise honest, faithful and meritorious.  38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d).

Willful misconduct meant an act involving conscious wrongdoing or known prohibited action (malum in se or malum prohibitum).  It involved deliberate or intentional wrongdoing with knowledge of or wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences.  Mere technical violation of police regulations or ordinances will not per se constitute willful misconduct.  Willful misconduct was not determinative unless it was the proximate cause of injury, disease or death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n).

Turning to the evidence, the Board notes that military personnel records show the Veteran received Commanding Officer's Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP) three times during his period of active service: in March 1973 for missing movement and unauthorized absence; in June 1973 for unauthorized absence; and in July 1973 for dereliction in performance of duty.  A July 18, 1973, administrative remark, signed by the Veteran, indicates that he voluntarily accepted a "GENERAL Discharge for Convenience of the Government under the provisions of BUPERS NOTICE 1900 of 20 April 1973."  A July 19, 1973, letter from the Veteran's Commanding Officer to the Chief of Naval Personnel requested a convenience of the government discharge by reason of substandard conduct.  The letter indicated that the Veteran was considered to be "a nonproductive performer whose military conduct is substandard and is becoming an administrative burden to the command due to frequent minor military infractions."  It was also noted that the Veteran's performance had been "non-contributory to unit readiness and mission accomplishment."  An August 7, 1973, administrative remark, also signed by the Veteran, indicated that he understood he was not recommended for reenlistment.  The authority cited was "CHNAVPERS msg 301954Z JUL 73."  The Veteran's DD Form 214 shows that he was discharged on August 16, 1973; his character of service was listed as "UNDER OTHER THAN HONORABLE CONDITIONS."  The remarks section noted that the Veteran was "DISCHARGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH BUPERS MSG 310954Z JUL 1973."

After review of the record, the Board finds that the November 30, 1978, administrative decision finding that the Veteran's character of discharge was under dishonorable conditions for the purpose of eligibility for VA benefits and a bar to VA compensation benefits, did not contain CUE because at the time of that decision; it was not absolutely clear that the correct facts were not before the adjudicators who issued the decision.  In that decision, the RO relied on the Veteran's DD Form 214, which showed that he was discharged under other than honorable conditions, as well as administrative remarks showing that he received Commanding Officer's Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP) three times during service: in March 1973 for missing movement and unauthorized absence; in June 1973 for unauthorized absence; and in July 1973 for dereliction in performance of duty.  Based on this evidence, the RO found that "it appears the veteran was guilty of offenses involving willful and persistent misconduct" and therefore determined that he had been discharged under dishonorable conditions, precluding payment of VA benefits.  However, as discussed above, the Veteran's military personnel records also show that on July 18, 1973, he agreed to accept a general discharge for convenience of the government, confirmed by a July 19, 1973, letter from the Veteran's Commanding Officer to the Chief of Naval Personnel requesting the Veteran's discharge.  This evidence appears to conflict with the DD Form 214 showing that he was discharged in August 1973 under other than honorable conditions.  

In written argument received in April 2020, the Veteran's then-representative argued that the "Remarks" section of the Veteran's DD Form 214 indicated that his discharge was "in accordance with" certain administrative remarks prepared July 18, 1973.  However, it is not clear that this was the case.  The remarks section indicated that the Veteran was "DISCHARGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH BUPERS MSG 301954Z JUL 1973."  Based on the evidence before the RO at the time, it is not absolutely clear that this was a reference to the administrative remarks prepared on July 18, 1973, which documented the Veteran's agreement to a general discharge for convenience of the government.  The personnel records did not contain a copy of the BUPERS (Bureau of Naval Personnel) message referenced in the remarks section of the DD Form 214, so the contents of that message are unclear.  Further, the Board notes that the July 19, 1973, letter from the Veteran's Commanding Officer to the Chief of Naval Personnel was couched as a request for the Veteran's discharge; it does not appear that a response to the request was of record at the time of the November 1978 administrative decision.  Arguably, an adjudicator could have questioned whether the request was granted in its entirety, or whether something else happened that could have resulted in the Veteran being discharged under other than honorable conditions, instead of the previously agreed upon general discharge.  In finding that the Veteran was discharged under other than honorable conditions, the RO could have reasonably concluded that Department of Defense officials had properly discharged their duties in preparing the Veteran's DD Form 2014 such that it could rely on the form in concluding that the Veteran was discharged under dishonorable conditions.  See United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926) (holding that there is a presumption of regularity under which it is presumed that government officials have properly discharged their official duties); Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307, 308-09 (1992).  Therefore, the RO did not clearly err in relying on the Veteran's DD Form 214 in reaching a conclusion as to his character of discharge.

At most, there was conflicting evidence concerning the Veteran's character of discharge, which likewise does not support a finding of CUE in this case.  Presented with conflicting evidence concerning his character of discharge, the RO could have-and perhaps should have-conducted additional development in an attempt to reconcile the apparent contradiction between the DD Form 214 showing an other than honorable discharge and the administrative remarks and letter indicating the Veteran had accepted a general discharge for convenience of the government.  However, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the RO failed to fully discharge its duty to assist in promulgating the November 1978 administrative decision without further investigating the nature of the Veteran's character of discharge, the requirements that a clear and unmistakable error be both outcome determinative and based on the record that existed at the time of the original decision make it impossible for a breach of the duty to assist to form the basis for CUE.  Cook v. Principi, 318 F.3d 1334, 1345-47 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  In other words, any breach by VA of its duty to assist, such as a failure to obtain an adequate examination or opinion, cannot form a basis for a claim of CUE because such a breach creates only an incomplete record rather than an incorrect one.  See Tetro v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 100, 109 (2000); Crippen v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 412, 424 (1996).

In reaching this conclusion, the Board acknowledges that in September 1995, the Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR) approved a correction to the Veteran's DD Form 2014 to show that he was discharged under honorable conditions.  In that decision, the BCNR found that the Veteran was discharged under honorable conditions on August 16, 1973, for the convenience of the government, under an expeditious discharge program; however "[d]ue to administrative inadvertence, the entry 'UNDER OTHER THAN HONORABLE CONDITIONS' was entered into item 9f of his DD Form 214."  In written argument submitted in June 2021, the Veteran's then-representative acknowledged that the September 1995 BCNR decision was not available to adjudicators at the time of the November 1978 administrative decision, but she contended the BCNR's conclusion "unambiguously demonstrate[d] that the true nature of the Veteran's character of discharge was evident from a review of the record in existence in 1978, as the facts reviewed by the service department in 1995 are the same facts that were 'in, or constructively in, the record' at the time of the 1978 decision."  However, a decision of the BCNR regarding the correction of a servicemember's naval record involves a different legal analysis and standard of review compared to that involved in a VA decision regarding the character of a former servicemember's discharge, or that involved in determining whether to reverse or revise a prior final VA decision on the basis of CUE.  For the reasons discussed above, the Veteran's motion for revision of the November 1978 administrative decision does not meet the stringent requirements for establishing CUE because, at the time of that decision, it was not absolutely clear that the correct facts were not before the adjudicators who issued the decision, and it was not clearly erroneous for the RO to rely on the Veteran's DD Form 214 in making a decision as to his character of discharge.

Again, the Board regrets that it cannot render a favorable decision in this matter. However, while it is sympathetic to the Veteran, the Board is ultimately bound by the law and is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis.  See Harvey, 6 Vet. App. at 425.
