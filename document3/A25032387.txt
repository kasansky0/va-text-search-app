REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for residuals of Parkinson's disease prior to the effective date of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1973 to March 1983.

Here, a November 2022 rating decision granted service connection for residuals of Parkinson's disease. This rating decision constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In December 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the November 2022 decision. In February 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued an HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2022 decision.

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the December 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.

In December 2023, the AOJ issued the rating decision on appeal, which granted the claim pursuant to the PACT Act. Thereafter, in the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for residuals of Parkinson's disease prior to effective date of the PACT Act, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Service connection for residuals of Parkinson's disease prior to the effective date of the PACT Act is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that he incurred Parkinson's disease due to his exposure to toxins while cleaning A-7 Corsairs aboard an aircraft carrier as well as performing corrosion control duties on the aircraft carrier. See August 2022 Correspondence.

On August 10, 2022, the President signed into law the Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022. 

In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for residuals of Parkinson's disease on a presumptive basis under the PACT Act. The effective date of a grant of service connection on a presumptive basis under the PACT Act can be no earlier than August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the ACT. In order for the effective date of the grant service connection in this case to be the submission date of the Veteran's Supplemental Claim, October 15, 2019, the claim must be granted on an alternate theory of entitlement. As such, theories of entitlement to service connection beyond the PACT Act must be explored. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

The Board notes that although a Decision Review Officer determined the necessity for an examination regarding service connection on a direct or secondary basis the record does not contain a medical opinion regarding the etiology of the Veteran's Parkinson's disease. See VA Form 20-0999 Higher-Level Review Return.

VA is obligated to provide an examination when the record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, the record indicates that the disability or signs and symptoms of disability may be associated with active service, and the record does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-3 (2006).

Here, the Veteran has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and was exposed to a number of toxins during his service in the Corrosion Control department maintaining A-7 Corsairs. These toxins included strong soaps and solvents, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and the jet fuel JP-4. See August 2022 Correspondence.  

The Board is not competent to determine the relationship between the Veteran's Parkinson's disease and the Veteran's exposure to various toxins. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991) (VA may only consider independent medical evidence to support its findings and is not permitted to base decisions on its own unsubstantiated medical conclusions). Thus, the Board finds that the requirements of McLendon for triggering VA's duty to obtain a medical opinion have been met.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a TERA opinion regarding the claimed exposures to strong soaps and solvents, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and the jet fuel JP-4 during his service. The examiner should interview the Veteran regarding the frequency and duration of exposure(s) and potential routes of exposure (inhalation, oral, dermal).
