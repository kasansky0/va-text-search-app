DOCKET NO. 250324-524521
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for pulmonary nodule (claimed as pulmonary condition, hereinafter "respiratory disability") is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's respiratory disability had its onset in active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for a respiratory disability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1963 to October 1965.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2025 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  In that rating decision, the RO denied service connection for pulmonary nodule (claimed as pulmonary condition).

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Respiratory Disability 

The Veteran asserts his current respiratory disability is the result of service, to include exposure to toxins, such as burn pits, Agent Orange, and jet fuel.  See September 2023 Statement in Support of Claim.   

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred inservice.  38 C.F.R. §3.303(d).

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology. ?38?C.F.R. §?3.159(a); Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 470?(1994).  "Symptoms, not treatment, are the essence of any evidence of continuity of symptomatology."  See Savage v. Gober,?10?Vet. App.?488, 496?(1997) (citing Wilson v. Derwinski,?2?Vet. App.?16, 19?(1991)). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

A current diagnosis and in-service injury are not at issue.  In the March 2025 rating decision, the RO conceded an in-service injury to include participation in a toxic exposure risk activity, specifically, toxic exposure to hydraulic fluid, fuels, oils, and lubricants; and a current diagnosis of pulmonary nodule.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104. 

The Veteran is competent to report the onset and persistent nature of his respiratory disability symptoms.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology that is not medical in nature); Charles v. Principi,16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002) (holding that particularly with respect to claims for tinnitus, a veteran is competent to present evidence of a diagnosis and continuous symptoms).

The Veteran's service treatment records show that at the time of his enlistment in September 1963, the Veteran did not suffer from any respiratory conditions.  In December 1963 the Veteran sought medical treatment and was diagnosed with laryngotracheobronchitis, a respiratory condition, which refers to inflammation of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi.  See STR - Medical, May 2018.  At that time, the Veteran had imaging performed which showed a pulmonary nodule at the right base of his lung.  Id.  

The Board acknowledges the negative opinion of the April 2024 VA examiner, and negative addendum opinions of the November 2024 and January 2025 VA examiners.  However, the April 2024 and November 2024 VA examiners both failed to address the Veteran's service treatment records showing the diagnosis of a respiratory condition and imaging showing an actual pulmonary nodule.  Additionally, the November 2024 VA examiner noted the risk factor of "smoking," however, the Veteran's VA treatment records show that he stopped smoking more than 30 years ago.  See CAPRI, received March 13, 2024.   The January 2025 VA examiner offers no rationale and applies an incorrect standard of proof.  Therefore, the opinions are afforded little probative value.  See Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 179 (2005) (a VA examination must be based on an accurate factual premise).

Service treatment records show evidence of an actual pulmonary nodule diagnosed during active duty.  The Board, therefore, affords greater weight to the Veteran's service treatment records and credible statements.

Accordingly, the most probative medical evidence of record suggests that the Veteran has a current respiratory disability that began during service.  The evidence is therefore at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's respiratory disability had its onset in service.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disability is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§3.102, 3.303(d); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
