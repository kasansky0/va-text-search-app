DOCKET NO. 240806-461278
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issues of entitlement to service connection for diabetes and entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for left shoulder strain with acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis and are dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 29, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Air Force from August 1976 to August 1990, from September 2005 to October 2005, from May 2007 to July 2007, from January 2009 to March 2009, and from November 2010 to January 2011.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is grateful for his service. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board by filing a Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) in August 2024 and requesting Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) direct review by the Board.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In the present case, the Veteran submitted two VA Forms 21-4138, both on March 29, 2025, expressing his desire to withdraw both his claims the subject of the present appeal: entitlement to service connection for diabetes and entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for left shoulder strain with acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis (which he then accurately described as the appealed a claim for limitation of motion of the arm, which is the basis of rating that disability under Diagnostic Code 5201).  Accordingly, he has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.

The Veteran has other pending claims on appeal before the Board (if they are not yet withdrawn and dismissed) which will be the subject of other Board decisions.  The Board does not currently merge AMA appeals.
