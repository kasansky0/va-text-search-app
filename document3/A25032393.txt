ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder, is denied.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a headache disability is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with hiatal hernia, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record is persuasively against finding that the Veteran has an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder, that arose during or as a result of his active service.

2. The Veteran has already been assigned the maximum schedular rating for tinnitus.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1979 to November 1983.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an August 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed his timely VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and chose direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). 

Accordingly, the Board will consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder

The Veteran contends he has a psychiatric disability that is due to his service. On the Veteran's January 2023 VA Form 21-526, the Veteran claimed his PTSD, anxiety, and depression are due to falling from a helicopter. 

The Board construes the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD as a claim for any acquired psychiatric disorder. See Clemmons v. West, 206 F.3d 1401, 1403 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding PTSD claims can be more broadly construed as service connection claims for any acquired psychiatric disorder).

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Generally, service connection requires (1) the existence of a present disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

If there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the appellant prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).

In a May 2019 PTSD screening, the Veteran's score was 0, which indicates a negative screen for PTSD. In an April 2021 VA assessment, the Veteran denied military and non-military PTSD. The Veteran's VA medical records are silent for a mental health diagnosis other than substance use.

The Veteran was afforded a VA PTSD examination in August 2023. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with stimulant use disorder, cocaine, severe. During the examination, the Veteran reported that he was unable to recall any in-service traumas that he experienced during his military service. The Veteran was not diagnosed with PTSD. The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion. In the rationale, the examiner stated the Veteran served during peace time and that he could not recall any in-service traumatic events to which he was exposed. The examiner went on to state that the Veteran has a life-long history of addiction issues. The examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). 

While the Veteran believes his acquired psychiatric disability is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, the Veteran is not competent to provide a nexus opinion in this case because the record does not show that he has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence failing to show a relationship to service in denying this claim.

2. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus

Evaluations of tinnitus are governed by the schedule of ratings for the ear. Under this schedule, tinnitus is compensated by a 10 precent disability rating, regardless of whether the claimant perceives the tinnitus in one ear or both ears, or whether it is recurrent or constant. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260.

Here, the Veteran is already in receipt of the highest schedular evaluation for his tinnitus, and neither the Veteran nor the record has provided any indication on what theory or evidence an increase would be warranted. Therefore, there is no basis for a higher award.

As the Veteran already has the maximum schedular disability rating, the appeal is denied.

The Board notes the Veteran filed his claim and included a claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss on his January 2023 VA Form 21-526. However, the AOJ informed him in June 2023 that he would need to resubmit the request on the proper form for it to be considered. The Veteran is advised he or his representative can file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) with new and relevant evidence. The Board points out the positive nexus opinion regarding bilateral hearing loss in the July 2023 VA hearing examination.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the AMA, the Board must remand to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors (including when the AOJ failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records, failed to obtain a VA examination, or provided an inadequate VA examination or opinion). 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension

The Veteran was afforded a VA hypertension examination and opinion in June 2023. The examiner indicated a diagnosis of hypertension. However, no nexus opinion was obtained.

In Barr, the facts were similar to this case in that the appellant was afforded a VA examination as part of a claim, but no VA opinion was obtained. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 305 (2007). The lack of an opinion was found, essentially, to be a duty to assist error. Thus, the Board finds remand is required to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error in failing to obtain a VA opinion.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a headache disability

The Veteran was afforded a VA headaches examination and opinion in June 2023. The Veteran was diagnosed with common headaches. The examiner noted the Veteran did not require medication and the VA files were silent for a headache diagnosis. The examiner ultimately rendered a negative nexus opinion. In the rationale, the examiner stated the Veteran's VA files were silent with no evidence of recurrence, progression, chronicity, residuals, or sequelae after leaving service.

However, the Veteran's VA medical records from January 2023 show his active problems include headaches. Thus, the Board finds the June 2023 VA opinion inadequate because the examiner failed to address the Veteran's medical records indicating complaints and treatment. See Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 305. Accordingly, the Board finds remand is required to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error in failing to an adequate VA opinion.

3. Entitlement to service connection for GERD with hiatal hernia 

The Veteran was afforded a VA esophageal condition examination and opinion in June 2023. The examiner found diagnoses of GERD and a hiatal hernia. The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion. In the rationale, the examiner stated that both are conditions diagnosed several decades after leaving service and she was unable to establish a nexus. 

As the examiner, in providing a nexus opinion for GERD with hiatal hernia disability, failed to provide adequate rationales, and relied on a lack of in-service treatment, the opinions are inadequate for the purpose of adjudicating the Veteran's claims. A negative opinion based solely on the lack of evidence in treatment records is inadequate. Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). Thus, this issue must be remanded to correct this correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain VA opinions from a qualified examiner in order to evaluate the etiology of the claimed hypertension, headaches, and GERD with hiatal hernia disabilities. The claims folder, including this remand and any relevant records contained in the electronic system, should be sent to the examiner for review, if possible; consideration of such should be reflected in the completed examination report or in an addendum. All indicated studies should be performed, all findings should be reported in detail, and all opinions must be supported by a detailed rationale. If the examiner feels an in person examination is needed, then one should be scheduled.

Based on a review of the record, the examiner should answer the following:

Whether the Veteran's hypertension, headaches and/or GERD with hiatal hernia are at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) etiologically related to service.
