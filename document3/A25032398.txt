ORDER

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability is denied.

Service connection for tinnitus is denied.

Service connection for hypertension is denied.

Service connection for right and left ulnar neuropathy/entrapment at elbows with carpal tunnel syndrome (claimed as peripheral neuropathy as a result of herbicide exposure) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss disability was not manifest in service or within 1 year following separation and is unrelated to service.

2. There is no current tinnitus disability or functional impairment of earning capacity from the like. Any current tinnitus was not manifest in service or within 1 year following separation and is unrelated to service.

3. The Veteran's current hypertension was not manifest in service or within 1 year following separation and is unrelated to service.

4. The Veteran's current right and left ulnar neuropathy/entrapment at elbows with carpal tunnel syndrome and his right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy were not manifest in service or within 1 year following separation and are unrelated to service.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1962 to December 1966, with service aboard the U.S.S. SCULPIN and a military occupational specialty as a Steward. We thank him for his service. He appeals from 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decisions based on claims filed in November 2023.   

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

For certain chronic diseases, such as organic disease of the nervous system (which includes neuropathies and tinnitus), a presumption of service connection arises if the disease is manifested to a degree of ten percent within one year following discharge from service.  Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 26,465 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(3), 3.309(a).  When a chronic disease is not shown to have manifested to a compensable degree within one year after service, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), for the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support a claim for such diseases; however, such continuity of symptomatology may only support a claim for those chronic diseases listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2013); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

There is also a presumption of service connection for certain diseases found to be associated with exposure to "herbicide agents", including Agent Orange. This presumption of service connection applies to hypertension and peripheral neuropathy. The PACT Act; 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). Absent affirmative evidence to the contrary, such diseases will be service-connected even if there is no evidence of the disease during service, provided herbicide exposure is established. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d). The presumption removes the need to prove a nexus, or causal relationship, between the current diagnosis and the in-service exposure.

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus

The Veteran appeals for service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability and tinnitus, alleging in November 2023 that they are due to noise (perhaps in service noise exposure). 

For VA compensation and pension purposes, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least 3 of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Based on the law and evidence, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted for bilateral hearing loss disability or tinnitus. 

First, the persuasive evidence indicates that the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss disability and any current tinnitus was not manifest in service or within 1 year of service discharge, and that it is unrelated to service. 

That evidence includes the service treatment records, which contain no indication of any hearing loss or ringing in the Veteran's ears. It also includes July and August 2022 VA medical records which report that the Veteran denied tinnitus and hearing loss, and September 2022 and December 2023 VA medical records which report that the Veteran denied having any hearing loss or hearing problems. 

And at the time of a VA examination in June 2024, the Veteran did not report recurrent tinnitus; and while bilateral hearing loss disability as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 was shown, the examiner concluded that there is no scientific basis on which to conclude that the hearing loss was caused by or the result of military service, to include military noise exposure. 

The examiner explained that the Veteran's military occupational specialty had been a Steward in service, a job with a low probability of hazardous noise exposure; and he did not serve in combat. No change in the Veteran's hearing had been shown in service. He did not list types of noise exposure, specific events, or dates of onset. He denied hearing loss and tinnitus currently, and any other noises perceived in the ears or head. There had been no complaint of hearing loss or tinnitus during service. Moreover, his signed medical history made no mention of ear or hearing problems at separation. There was no evidence in the Veteran's service treatment records (or following service) of any in service injury, event, or disease, including acoustic trauma. And the Institute of Medicine reported in 2006 that based on current understanding of auditory physiology, hearing loss from noise injuries occurs immediately following exposure; and that there is no scientific basis to conclude that permanent hearing loss directly attributable to noise exposure will develop long after such noise exposure.  

And for the tinnitus claim, no current tinnitus disability or functional impairment of earning capacity is objectively shown. There is no evidence of record that any tinnitus rises to the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The Veteran has not asserted that ear or head noise sounds interfere with employment or his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life. The existence of satisfactory evidence of a current disease or injury is a cornerstone of a service connection claim. In the absence of satisfactory evidence of a current tinnitus disease, injury, or disability, or evidence of symptoms rising to the level of functional impairment of earning capacity, service connection cannot be granted. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143-144 (1992); Saunders.  

Service connection for hypertension

The Veteran appeals for service connection for hypertension, indicating in November 2023 that the basis is Agent Orange exposure or the PACT Act. Based on the law and evidence, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted for the Veteran's current hypertension. 

First, the persuasive evidence indicates that the Veteran's current hypertension was not manifest in service or within 1 year of service discharge, and that it is unrelated to service. 

That evidence includes the service treatment records, which do not report it. It is not shown until many years after service. 

Additionally, the Veteran has not shown that he was exposed to Agent Orange in service, and a classified researcher was unable to confirm that the Veteran the Veteran had Agent Orange exposure in service in May 2024. The evidence of record did not show that the Veteran had service in a qualifying nautical location or duty or visitation in Vietnam. 

A TERA memorandum shows that the Veteran would have had minimal exposure to asbestos aboard the U.S.S. SCULPIN with a military occupational specialty of Stewardsman. 

And then in June 2024, a VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's hypertension was less likely than not caused by his military occupational specialty as a Stewardsman. It was felt that he would have had minimal exposure to asbestos aboard the U.S.S. SCULPIN after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran. The examiner indicated that there is no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication of a causal relationship between the development of hypertension and the Veteran's TERA (minimal asbestos exposure). Also, there were risk factors outside of service, such as heredity, congenitality, occupational, and lifestyle that outweigh the TERA factors identified. 

Service connection for right and left ulnar neuropathy/entrapment at elbows with carpal tunnel syndrome (claimed as peripheral neuropathy as a result of herbicide exposure), and for right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy

The Veteran appeals for service connection right and left ulnar neuropathy/entrapment at elbows with carpal tunnel syndrome (claimed as peripheral neuropathy as a result of herbicide exposure), and for right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, indicating in November 2023 that the basis is Agent Orange exposure. 

Based on the law and evidence, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted for these current disabilities. 

First, the persuasive evidence indicates that these were not manifest in service or within 1 year of service discharge, and that they are unrelated to service. 

That evidence includes the service treatment records, which do not report them. They are not shown until many years after service. 

Additionally, the Veteran has not shown that he was exposed to Agent Orange in service, and a classified researcher was unable to confirm Agent Orange exposure in May 2024. The evidence of record did not show that the Veteran had service in a qualifying nautical location or duty or visitation in Vietnam. 

A TERA memorandum shows that the Veteran would have had minimal exposure to asbestos aboard the U.S.S. SCULPIN with a military occupational specialty of Stewardsman. 

And then in June 2024, a VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's neuropathies are less likely than not caused by his military occupational specialty as a Stewardsman. It was felt that he would have had only minimal exposure to asbestos aboard the U.S.S. SCULPIN after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran. The examiner indicated that there is no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication of a causal relationship between the development of the Veteran's neuropathies and the Veteran's TERA (minimal asbestos exposure). Also, there were risk factors outside of service, such as heredity, congenital, occupational, and lifestyle that outweigh the TERA factors identified. 

Additionally, the record does not support continuity of symptomatology for any of the disabilities on appeal. Following separation from service the evidence of record does not show any complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for them until years post-service, when the Veteran applied for VA benefits. The absence of post-service complaints, findings, diagnosis, or treatment for the claimed disorders for years after service separation is one factor that tends to weigh against a finding of continuity of symptoms of them. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-7.

We have carefully considered the evidence but find that there is no basis to allow any of the claims on appeal. The persuasive evidence is against the claims and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved in the Veteran's favor concerning them.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1991).
