ORDER

An effective date of April 23, 2017, but not earlier, for service-connection of lumbar condition is granted.

A 40 percent initial evaluation for service-connected lumbar condition is granted.

An initial evaluation more than 40 percent for service-connected lumbar condition is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran first filed an application for service connection for low back condition on April 23, 2017, and the regional office (RO) denied the claim in a November 2017 rating decision. 

2. The Veteran appealed the November 2017 rating decision, and the RO again denied the claim on a March 2018 statement of the case.

3. The Veteran did not appeal the March 2018 statement of the case. 

4. The Veteran filed claims for service connection of low back condition in October 2018, May 2019, and November 2021.  In February 2022, the RO reconsidered and denied the appealed claim.

5. In October 2022, the RO granted service connection for back condition effective September 2021.

6. In August 2023, the RO granted an earlier effective date of October 2018 for service connection of back condition.

7. The October 2022 award of service connection for back condition was based at least "in part" on newly provided, but previously existing service records.

8. From April 23, 2017 to July 7, 2022, the Veteran's back condition and corresponding functional impairment, including during flare ups, more nearly approximates the criteria of forward flexion of 30 degrees or less.

9. The evidence weighs persuasively against an initial evaluation greater than 40 percent for service-connected lumbar condition.

10. From April 23, 2017 to July 7, 2022, the Veteran's lumbar condition and corresponding functional impairment, including during flare ups, did not manifest, or approximate, symptoms analogous to ankylosis or result in incapacitating episodes with a total duration of at least 6 weeks in a year.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of April 23, 2017, but not earlier, for service connection of lumbar condition is met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an initial evaluation of 40 percent for degenerative lumbar condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.71a diagnostic code (DC) 5237.

3. The criteria for an initial evaluation more than 40 percent for degenerative lumbar condition have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.71a DC 5237.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 2003 to April 2004.  

In April 2017, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for lumbar condition that was denied by RO in a November 2017 rating decision.  The Veteran appealed the November 2017 rating decision, and the RO again denied the claim on a March 2018 statement of the case.  Then, in October 2018, May 2019, and November 2021 the Veteran filed claims for service connection of lumbar condition and in February 2022 the RO reconsidered and denied the claim.  

In May 2022, the Veteran filed a higher-level review for the claim and in June 2022 the RO identified a duty to assist error for the appealed condition.  In October 2022, the RO granted service connection for lumbar condition with a 10 percent evaluation from September 2021 and 40 percent from July 2022.  

In April 2023, the Veteran filed a higher-level review for an earlier effective date and increase rating for lumbar condition and in August 2023 the RO granted an earlier effective date of October 2, 2018 for the appealed condition.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected a Direct Review.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 and October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal was not considered.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider with respect to the appealed claims, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

If VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim.  Service department records include records that are related to a claimed in-service event, injury, or disease, regardless of whether they mention the veteran by name.  See 38 C.F.R. §3.156(c)(1)(i).  An award made based either entirely or in part on such service department records will be effective on the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(3).  This exception does not apply to records that VA could not have obtained when it decided the claim originally because the records did not exist at the time of the original decision or because the claimant failed to provide sufficient information for VA to identify and obtain the records from the appropriate sources. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(2).

In Jones v. Wilkie, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Court) held that reconsideration of a claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1) does not necessitate the assignment of an effective date under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3). Rather, when determining whether an earlier effective date is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3), the question is whether the award of benefits was based all or in part on relevant service department records that existed and had not been associated with the file when VA first decided the claim.  See Jones v. Wilkie 964 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

In Morse v. McDonough, the Court held that VA's obligation to reconsider a claim based upon receipt of new service department records pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1) is satisfied by readjudication of the claim on the merits, to include all evidence of record, and does not require that the decision cite to § 3.156(c)(1) or refer to the decision as a reconsideration.  If a VA benefit is awarded based on a claim received after a final VA decision that considered the new service department records, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3) and (4) permitting assignment of an effective date prior to that claim do not apply.  See Morse v. McDonough, 994 F. 3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Earlier effective date for service connection of lumbar condition.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date of April 23, 2017, for service connection of lumbar condition.  See VA form 10182 (July 2024).  

On April 23, 2017, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection of lumbar condition that was denied by the RO in a November 2017 rating decision.  The Veteran appealed the November 2017 rating decision, and the RO again denied the claim on a March 2018 statement of the case.  Then, in October 2018, May 2019, and November 2021 the Veteran filed claims for service connection of lumbar condition and in February 2022 the RO reconsidered and denied the claim.  In May 2022, the Veteran filed a higher-level review for the claim and in June 2022 the RO identified a duty to assist error for the appealed condition.  In October 2022, the RO granted service connection for lumbar condition with a 10 percent evaluation from September 2021.  In April 2023, the Veteran filed a higher-level review for an earlier effective date and increase rating for lumbar condition and in August 2023 the RO granted an earlier effective date of October 2, 2018 for the appealed condition.  In July 2024, the Veteran filed a 10182 requesting an earlier effective date of April 2017 for service connection of lumbar condition.  

In April 2017 the Veteran filed the first claim for lumbar condition and the RO denied the claim in a November 2017 rating decision.  Since that time, VA associated service records, including medical treatment records for lumbar condition in service.  See STR (June 2019).  These service treatment records were found to be relevant for the August 2022 examiner positive nexus opinion relating the condition to service.  See VA medical examination (August 2022).  Additionally, the records existed when the RO first decided the claim but were not associated with the file at the time of the November 2017 rating decision.  Further, the August 2022 medical opinion was part of evidence cited by the RO's October 2022 rating decision granting service connection of lumbar condition.  See Rating decision- Narrative (October 2022).  Thus, the Board finds the award of service connection for lumbar condition was based at least "in part" on the newly provided, but previously existing service treatment records.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(3).

For the above reasons, the evidence weighs in favor of the Veteran's claim and an earlier effective date of April 23, 2017, for service connection of lumbar condition is warranted. 

Disability Ratings

Ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.  The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155.  

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C.A. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  

The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2009). 

After consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

2. A 40 percent initial evaluation for service-connected lumbar condition.

The Veteran seeks an initial evaluation higher than 10 percent for low back condition.  

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Rating Formula), with or without symptoms such as pain, stiffness or aching in the area of the spine affected by residuals of injury or disease, the following ratings will apply: A 10 percent rating is warranted when forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is assigned when forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is awarded for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.

For VA compensation purposes, normal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is zero to 90 degrees, extension is zero to 30 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 30 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 30 degrees.  The combined range of motion refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate V.  

There are several notes following the General Rating Formula criteria, which provide: (5) Unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the entire cervical spine, or the entire spine, is fixed in flexion or extension.  Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

There evidence does not reveal incapacitating episodes based on intervertebral disc syndrome of the lumbar spine (IVDS), therefore the Board finds the General Rating Formula is more favorable to the Veteran and will be used for rating purposes.  See VA examination (August 2022).  

The Veteran underwent lumbar VA examinations in October 2017 and December 2021.  See VA medical examinations (October 2017 and December 2021).  However, the examiners did not adequately address the pertinent lay and medical evidence of record regarding the severity of the Veteran's lumbar condition.  Moreover, the examiners did not provide an adequate medical opinion assessing the severity, flare ups, active and passive motion, and weight and non-weight bearing problems of the Veteran's lumbar condition, throughout the appeal.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Sharp v. Shulkin,29 Vet. App. 26 (2017); Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  Consequently, the examinations are inadequate and provided minimal probative weight.  

Nevertheless, an August 2022 VA medical examination revealed functional impairment, and range of motion inhibited by pain and stiffness.  Additionally, the examination shows severe flare ups affecting daily activities, bending, lifting, walking, and standing with an estimated limitation of forward flexion of 30 degrees.  Further, the report indicated guarding with the use of medications, physical therapy, and rest to alleviate symptoms.  The examination did not find ankylosis or symptoms equivalent to ankylosis, atrophy, or IVDS with incapacitating episodes requiring bed rest prescribed by a physician.  See VA medical examination (August 2022).  Thus, the August 2022 medical examination findings constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim.  

Here, the probative evidence, including medical treatment records, lay statements and medical examination, demonstrate the Veteran's lumbar symptoms more nearly approximate the criteria for forward flexion of 30 degrees or less.  Indeed, the August 2022 examination findings demonstrate a range of motion inhibited by pain and stiffness, and severe flare ups affecting daily activities, bending, lifting, walking, and standing for the appeal period.  Moreover, the Board found the August 2022 examination documents the only probative findings.  Further, the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012); Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, 1 (Mar. 12, 2025).  DC 8520 does not contemplate relief by medications and VA is required "to discount beneficial medication effects when relevant rating criteria do not specifically contemplate medication use.  The beneficial effects of medications are not known and thus the Board has considered those implications in adjudicating this matter.

On balance, the probative evidence weighs in favor of a 40 percent initial evaluation for lumbar condition and demonstrates the Veteran's lumbar condition more nearly approximate the criteria for forward flexion of 30 degrees or less.  See VA medical examination (August 2022).  Therefore, a 40 percent initial evaluation for lumbar disability under DC 5237 is warranted. 

3. An initial evaluation more than 40 percent for service-connected lumbar condition.

As to an initial evaluation higher than 40 percent, the Board finds the August 2022 examination finding to be probative evidence demonstrating the Veteran's lumbar symptoms did not more nearly approximate ankylosis or result in incapacitating episodes requiring bed rest prescribed by a physician.  Indeed, the examiner possesses the necessary education, training, and expertise to provide the requested examination and to determine the severity of the Veteran's lumbar condition.  Further, the examination findings reflect a thorough review of the record and consideration of the Veteran's lay statements.  Thus, the August 2022 medical examination findings constitute highly probative evidence weighing substantially against the claim of an initial evaluation more than 40 percent.  

Here, the probative evidence, including medical treatment records, lay statements and medical examination, does not indicate the Veteran's lumbar symptoms more nearly approximate ankylosis or result in incapacitating episodes with a total duration of at least 6 weeks in a year.  The probative evidence shows the Veteran did not suffer from fixation of a spinal segment in neutral, flexion, or extension position for the appealed period.  See VA medical examination (August 2022); Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).  Further, even by discounting the beneficial medication effects, the probative evidence does not suggest these symptoms more nearly approximate the above-mentioned criteria warranting a higher evaluation.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012); Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, 1 (Mar. 12, 2025).  Thus, the Veteran's service-connected lumbar disorder is adequately contemplated by, and adequately compensated by, a 40 precent initial evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

For the above reasons, the evidence for and against a rating greater than 40 percent is neither evenly balanced nor approximately.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim and demonstrates the Veteran's symptoms do not more nearly approximate ankylosis or incapacitating episodes with a total duration of at least 6 weeks in a year.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application and an initial evaluation greater than 40 percent is not warranted.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
