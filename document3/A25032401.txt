ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the right lower extremity (claimed as bilateral lower extremities) is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the left lower extremity (claimed as bilateral lower extremities) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to Agent Orange and other herbicide agents during his service in Vietnam from August 1969 to August 1970. 

2. The most probative medical evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's current diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy of the right and left lower extremities (hereinafter referred to as "peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities") is a result of exposure to Agent Orange during his military service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the right lower extremity (claimed as bilateral lower extremities) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the left lower extremity (claimed as bilateral lower extremities) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force from July 1968 to July 1972, with service in Vietnam. 

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the right lower extremity and entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the left lower extremity most recently addressed in an August 2013 rating decision.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection - Laws and Regulation

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in, or aggravated by, active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110. 

The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

A veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service.  38 U.S.C. § 1116 (a) (4); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(iii).

If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service, certain enumerated diseases, including early-onset peripheral neuropathy, shall be service-connected if the requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 1116, 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(iii) are met, even though there is no record of such disease during service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1113; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d) are also met.

Early-onset peripheral neuropathy must become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of last exposure to herbicides to qualify for the presumption of service connection. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(6), 3.309(e). 78 Fed. Reg. 54763-01 (Sept. 6, 2013). There is no herbicide-related presumption of service connection for "delayed-onset chronic" peripheral neuropathy.

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994) 

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Peripheral Neuropathy of The Bilateral Lower Extremities - Evidence and Analysis

The Veteran contends that his peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities is due to exposure to Agent Orange while in service. See September 2023 VA Form 20-005 Supplemental Claim Application, June 2012 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim, and December 2024 Appellate Brief. 

Here, the AOJ made the following favorable findings. First, the Veteran served in Vietnam from August 1969 to August 1970. See DD-214. Second, participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) is conceded. See December 2023 TERA Memorandum. Third, early-onset neuropathy is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to military service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309. Fourth, the Veteran has a diagnosis of lower extremity neuropathy. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility August 2011 Neurological Consult and March 2012 Southeast Vein & Laser Center, PC. The Board is bound by these prior favorable AOJ findings as they are not clearly and unmistakably erroneous. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

The Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records show no complaints or treatment for peripheral neuropathy.  Moreover, the record does not indicate that the Veteran had symptoms of peripheral neuropathy manifesting to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after his exposure to herbicide agents. Therefore, service connection for peripheral neuropathy cannot be presumed based on his presumed exposure to herbicides agents. See 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(e).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, service connection for peripheral neuropathy based on herbicide agent exposure may still be granted with proof of direct causation. See 38 U.S.C. § 1113; Combee, supra.

Upon review of the record, entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities is warranted on a direct basis. 

Regarding the question of a nexus, the record contains two medical opinions.  

In July 2013, the Veteran was afforded an in-person VA examination. The VA examiner opined that it is less likely than not the polyneuropathy bilateral of the lower extremities was caused by or related to military service. The medical records are silent for this condition while in military service. The Veteran had acute left leg cramp/pain that resolved without sequela in the military. This acute condition is not related to neuropathy 40+ years later. See CAPRI - July 2023 VA Examination.

In August 2014, the VA received a positive medical opinion from Dr. K.K, M.D., who is identified as a licensed neurologist who treated the Veteran for his neuropathy. Dr. K.K. stated that in their professional opinion (Agent Orange) can be a contributing factor to Diabetes Mellitus Type II, certain types of cancer, and polyneuropathy. The Veteran has a long standing history of worsening pain and numbness. Dr. K.K. feels that this neuropathy is caused from exposure to Agent Orange. The Veteran has no family history of neuropathy or other causative etiology in the Veteran's history. During the Veteran's military career, he did serve during the timeframe in which he would have been exposed to Agent Orange. Dr. K.K. based his opinion on miscellaneous articles that he read and continuing education throughout his 21 years of practicing medicine. See August 2014 Third Party Correspondence. 

Based on the record, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively in support of the claim. In this regard, the Board assigns high probative weight to Dr. K.K.'s opinion because it contains sound reasoning, is specific to this Veteran, and aligns with prior medical evidence of the record as well as the Veteran's lay statements. See?Nieves-Rodriguez?v. Peake,?22?Vet. App.?295?(2008). The Board recognizes that the Court has not fully embraced a "treating physician rule" under which a treating physician's opinion would presumptively be given greater weight than that of any other examiner. See Winsett v. West, 11 Vet. App. 420, 424-25 (1998); Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 471-73. Regardless, the length of a medical professional's opportunity or opportunities to examine a claimant may be considered in assigning probative weight. Id. As such, Dr. K.K.'s opinion is of significant probative weight because he treated the Veteran for his peripheral neuropathy during the time of 2011 to 2014 and had ample opportunity to examine the Veteran and treat his disability. See Medical Treatment Records - Non-Government Facility received by VA in September 2023. Additionally, Dr. K.K. is a licensed neurologist and therefore has the requisite medical training to opine in this case. Resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Boards find that service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities is warranted.

By contrast, the unfavorable July 2013 VA nexus opinion carries little probative weight. The VA examiner did not address the Veteran's contention that his peripheral neuropathy was caused by his exposure to Agent Orange in the course of his military duties, but instead relied on an absence of documentation in the record without taking into account the Veteran's reports of symptoms and his history. See Dalton v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) [A medical opinion is inadequate if it is based solely on the absence of documentation in the record and does not take into account the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history (even if recorded in the course of the examination]; Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60 (2019) (holding that an examination report was inadequate "[b]ecause the examiner did not provide any rationale for his opinion that was specific to [the Veteran's] particular medical condition and circumstances"). Therefore, the VA nexus opinion is inadequate for rating purposes. 

Accordingly, the Boards finds that the most probative evidence persuasively demonstrates that the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities is due to his military service. Therefore, service connection is warranted, and the appeal is granted.
