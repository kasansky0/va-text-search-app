ORDER

Service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran currently has a diagnosis of migraine headaches, he began to experience such headaches in service, and these headaches have continued to the present day.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1990 to February 1991.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application and requested readjudication of service connection for migraine headaches, most recently addressed in a September 1991 rating decision.  In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In his March 2024 VA Form 10182 (notice of disagreement), the Veteran referenced the December 2023 decision and elected the Board's Hearing docket.  He testified at a Board hearing on January 6, 2025.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of December 21, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a).  If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after December 21, 2023, and before the Board hearing on January 6, 2025, or more than 90 days after the Board hearing, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The Veteran seeks service connection for migraine headaches.  See supplemental claim from August 16, 2023.  The decision on appeal determined that the Veteran was treated for frequent headaches in service and had a diagnosis of migraines.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings. While there was a notation that the Veteran's headaches existed prior to service, the Veteran denied headaches at the 2025 Board hearing and his clinical entrance examination was normal, so he is presumed sound at entrance. 38 U.S.C. § 1111.

At an October 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted a history of migraine headaches for the last two years, per an August 2023 VA treatment record.  The VA examiner, however, did not issue a medical opinion.  Rather, in December 2023, a different VA examiner opined that it is less likely than not that the claimed condition is due to service, as there is a lack of substantiating evidence support a nexus between the current diagnosis of migraine and military service, adding that, without chronicity during or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology.

At his January 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he began to experience headaches soon after he was injured during pugil sticks training.  He believes that his headaches are related to a head injury sustained during this training.  Service treatment records show that, in November 1990, the Veteran was treated for an elbow injury sustained during pugil sticks training.  One month later, in December 1990, he sought treatment for headaches and was diagnosed with tension headaches.  Further evaluations conducted in January 1991 resulted in a diagnosis of "probable common migraine", for which the Veteran was medically discharged, also in January 1991.  

At the Board hearing, the Veteran reported a history of worsening headaches since service and up to the present.  Regarding treatment for his headaches, he stated that prior to being prescribed medication, every time he went to the hospital, it was recommended that he take two aspirins.

The Veteran is competent to report any observable symptoms and history of treatment, and such reports must be considered.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  In this case, the Veteran has reported a continuous history of headaches since service.  The Board finds no reason no doubt the veracity of the Veteran's testimony.

A nexus between a current disability and an in-service injury or event may be established by evidence of continuity of symptomatology, if the condition is a chronic disease enumerated under 38 U.S.C. § 1101.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-40 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Migraine headaches are considered an organic disease of the nervous system; hence, the Veteran's headaches are considered a chronic disease pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).

Based on the above, and resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for migraine headaches is warranted.  The weight of the evidence establishes that the Veteran currently has a diagnosis of migraine headaches, that he began to experience migraine headaches in service, and that these headaches have continued to the present day.  Therefore, the Board finds that all criteria for entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches are met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(b), 3.309(a).
