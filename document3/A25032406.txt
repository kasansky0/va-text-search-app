ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition is dismissed.

An effective date of March 25, 2020, but no earlier, for the increased evaluation of 20 percent for the right shoulder disability is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a May 13, 2021 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition; and a May 14, 2021 letter notified the Veteran of this decision and his appellate rights.

2. On August 31, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2021 rating decision.

3. In an October 14, 2021 HLR decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition; and an October 18, 2024 letter notified the Veteran of this decision.

4. On June 14, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested review of the October 2021 decision for entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition. 

5. While the Supplemental Claim review initiated in June 2022 was pending, on October 15, 2022 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in which he selected the Direct Review docket and identified the October 2021 decision's denial of his service connection claim for the right arm condition.  The VA subsequently sent the Veteran a letter on October 21, 2022 notifying him that his appeal had been placed on the Direct Review docket based on the Board appeal option he selected in the October 15, 2022 VA Form 10182.

6. To date, the AOJ has not issued a decision regarding the June 14, 2022 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.

7. The Veteran's submission of the May 15, 2022 VA Form 10182 was a prohibited concurrent election and therefore not valid for purposes of initiating an appeal of the October 2021 decision.

8. The Veteran's March 25, 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ is a claim for increased disability compensation of the right shoulder, and thus triggers the one-year-lookback period.

9. The probative evidence of record supports a finding that the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder disability was manifested by painful motion throughout the one-year lookback period prior to the March 25, 2021 claim for increase.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal with respect to entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

2. The criteria for an effective date of March 25, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of an increased rating of 20 percent for the right shoulder disability are met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o)(2). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from July 2000 to December 2007.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision issued in October 2021 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

Procedurally, in May 2021, the AOJ granted an increased rating for a right shoulder disability with an evaluation of 20 percent, effective March 25, 2021, and denied service connection for a right arm condition.  In August 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2021 rating decision.  In October 2021, the AOJ issued the HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2021 decision.  In the October 2021 HLR decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for the increased rating of 20 percent for the right shoulder disability and denied service connection for a right arm condition.  Thereafter, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing the October 2021 HLR decision and electing the Board's Direct Review docket.  

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of May 13, 2021-the date of the rating decision which prompted the Veteran's selection of the HLR review lane.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 3.2601(f).  If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after May 13, 2021 for these issues, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Additionally, the Board notes that the October 2022 VA Form 10182 did not express disagreement with the issue of increased evaluation for the right shoulder disability that was increased to 20 percent, effective March 25, 2021.  As such, it will not be addressed below.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

The AMA review system automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. §3.2400(a)(1).  As applicable to this case, under the AMA review system, within one year from the date on which the AOJ issues a notice of a decision on a claim or issue, except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (e), and (f), a claimant may elect one of the following administrative review options by timely filing the appropriate form prescribed by the Secretary: (i) a request for a higher-level review under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601; or (ii) an appeal to the Board under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(1).  A claimant who has filed for review under of one of those options, may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for a review under a different available option.  38 C.F.R. §3.2500(b).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, an appeal to the Board must be initiated by the filing of a NOD in the form prescribed by the Secretary.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201.  The NOD must be in writing and identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §20.202(a).  The term issue means an adjudication of a specific entitlement as described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(c).  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).  Except as provided in the case of simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed NOD with a decision by the AOJ within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  

The record shows that on May 13, 2021, the AOJ issued a rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition.  A May 14, 2021 letter notified the Veteran of this decision and his appellate rights under the modernized review system.

On August 31, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2021 rating decision.  In response to this submission, the AOJ issued an October 14, 2021 HLR decision in which it denied entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition.  An October 18, 2021 letter notified the Veteran of this decision.

On June 14, 2022, the Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested review of the October 2021 decision for entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition.  On the same date, the Veteran also submitted additional evidence in support of his claim.  See VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

While the Supplemental Claim review was pending at the AOJ, on October 15, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in which he selected the Direct Review docket and identified the October 18, 2021 date of notification associated with the October 14, 2021 HLR decision's denial of his service connection claim for a right arm condition.  The VA subsequently sent the Veteran a letter on October 21, 2022 notifying him that his appeal had been placed on the Direct Review docket based on the Board appeal option he selected in the October 15, 2022 VA Form 10182.

The Board finds that the October 15, 2022 VA Form 10182 was docketed in error regarding the service connection for right arm issue.  Following receipt of the Supplemental Claim, the AOJ did not issue a rating decision adjudicating the merits of the Veteran's service connection claim, so review is still pending before the AOJ.  The Veteran's subsequent submission of the VA Form 10182 was a prohibited concurrent election and cannot function as a valid appeal of the same issue of service connection for a right arm condition.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (stating that a claimant can file more than one administrative review request in response to an AOJ decision, provided that the requests are filed within one year of the AOJ decision and that the review requests are not pending concurrently).  Further review of the issue of entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition under the Direct Review docket in relation to the October 15, 2022 VA Form 10182 would be procedurally inappropriate and constitute a claims processing error.

In sum, the Board cannot review the issue of service connection for a right arm condition in relation to the submitted VA Form 10182 as the Veteran already requested a Supplemental Claim review for the same issue, which is currently still pending before the AOJ.  Therefore, the Veteran's submission of the October 15, 2022 VA Form 10182 was not valid for purposes of initiating an appeal of this issue in the October 14, 2021 decision.  The Veteran's appeal as to this issue is therefore dismissed in violation of a claims-processing rule.

The Board notes that this decision does not leave the Veteran without recourse.  The Veteran is free to notify the AOJ that the June 14, 2022 Supplemental Claim is still pending. Indeed, the Veteran's represented noted in May 2023 correspondence that they were still waiting on the AOJ's decision regarding the supplemental claim filed on June 14, 2022. 

2. Entitlement to an effective date of March 25, 2020, but no earlier, for the increased evaluation of 20 percent for the right shoulder disability is granted.

The Veteran contends that the 20 percent rating effective March 25, 2021, for the right shoulder disability, should have an earlier effective date.  See, e.g., August 31, 2021 VA Form 20-0996, at 3, 6.

The general rule regarding effective dates is found at 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a): "Unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor."  However, VA regulations also allow for the assignment of an increased rating up to one year prior to receipt of a formal claim for increase, sometimes informally called the 'one-year-lookback period' when it is "factually ascertainable" that an increase in disability had occurred, in which case the award may be from such date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o)(2).  

Here, the Veteran filed a claim for increased disability for his right shoulder on March 25, 2021.  See March 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.  Therefore, the one-year look back period is for consideration. See Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277, 292 (2024) (stating that Congress separated supplemental claims and increased compensation claims for good reason: increased compensation claims allow for a 1-year look back via 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3)).

After careful review of the record, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of March 25, 2020, is warranted for the increased evaluation of 20 percent for the right shoulder disability.  In the May 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted an increased rating of 20 percent for the right shoulder based on painful motion of the shoulder and x-ray evidence of degenerative arthritis.  The evidence shows that for the entire one-year lookback period, the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder disability was manifested by painful motion, with x-ray evidence of degenerative arthritis.  See, e.g., March 26, 2021 CAPRI, at 56 (noting shoulder pain on September 1, 2020 under past and current medical history); id. at 66 (noting shoulder pain on May 15, 2020 under current problems); May 11, 2021 C&P Exam, at 19 (noting an x-ray of the right shoulder dated April 2008 showing degenerative arthritis).

In sum, there is sufficient evidence of record to find it factually ascertainable that the Veteran's right shoulder disability manifested painful motion within the one-year lookback period of the March 25, 2021 claim for an increased evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  Therefore, entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 25, 2020, but no earlier, for the increased rating of 20 percent is granted.
