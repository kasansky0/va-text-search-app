ORDER

An effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis is denied. 

An effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the grant of service connection for sinusitis is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The date entitlement arose for the grant of service connection for allergic, August 5, 2021, is later than the date VA received the Veteran's claim, February 28, 2020.

2. The date entitlement arose for the grant of service connection for sinusitis, August 5, 2021, is later than the date VA received the Veteran's claim, February 28, 2020.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.320, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the award of service connection for sinusitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.320, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from January 2009 to March to 2009, from May 2009 to June 2010, from August 2010 to November 2010, and from August 2017 to November 2017.

This appeal is being adjudicated according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  See 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 169 (Jan. 18, 2019); 38 C.F.R. § 19.2.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision issued by a Regional Office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, which was subsequently subject to Higher-Level Review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Evidentiary Standards

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal.  VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

The law requires the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-29 (2000).  The Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence within the period on appeal and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim. 

Any findings favorable to the Veteran made by the VA Regional Office in notification of a decision are binding on the Board unless rebutted by clear and unmistakable error in the finding.  38 C.F.R. 20.801(a).  "Findings" means "conclusions on questions of fact and application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue under review."  Id.  

Effective Dates

38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1).  The implementing regulation similarly provides that the effective date of an award of benefits, provides: 

Unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.

38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1).  The implementing regulation similarly provides that the effective date generally "will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  "Date of receipt" means the date on which a claim, information, or evidence was received by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  

"Claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-5 (1998); Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199.  

VA amended its regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57669 (Sept. 25, 2014).  The amendments, however, are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.   

When determining the proper effective date, VA should not assign the date "mechanically" as of the date of an exam. Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (20150.  Instead, all relevant evidence of record must be considered to determine when an increase in disability is factually ascertainable.  Id. 

Effective August 5, 2021, VA promulgated an interim final rule regarding presumptive service connection for Gulf War veterans for three chronic respiratory health conditions, including asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis, in associate with particulate matter.  Under the interim final rule, these shall be service connected even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service if it manifests within 10 years from the date of separation from military service that included active-duty service during the Gulf War in Southwest Asia.  38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a).  Exposure is presumed unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to fine particulate matter during service. Id.  The interim final rule applies to all claims received by the VA on or after August 5, 2021, and that were pending before the VA, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, or the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on August 5, 2021.  85 Fed. Reg. 42724 (August 5, 2021).  

If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); see also Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; Kuzma, 341 F.3d 1327.  

However, where compensation is awarded pursuant to a liberalizing law, or regulation, "the effective date of such award or increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the act or administrative issue."  38 U.S.C. § 5110; see, e.g., Brown v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 290, 296 (2007).  In essence, when there is no facts-found basis to grant, the liberalizing law's effective date is "the date entitlement arose".  McGrath, at 35.  In other words, if the VA received a claim prior to the liberalizing law's effective date, and the claim is granted based on the liberalizing law and not on a facts-found basis, then the later liberalizing law's effective date is the controlling date in awarding service connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Likewise, if a claim was received after the liberalizing law's effective date, then the controlling date for an award of service connection would be the date the claim was received since that is the later date, as instructed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

In short, the effective date of service connection may be earlier than the currently assigned effective date based on the presumption of toxic exposure if there is evidence to support direct or secondary service connection.  

1. An effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the grant of service connection of allergic rhinitis is denied. 

The Veteran filed a claim of service connection for allergic rhinitis in February 2020, which was eventually granted in a February 2023 rating decision, based on the legal presumptions related to toxic exposures in service.  The February 2023 rating decision which effectuated that grant assigned the effective date of August 5, 2021, the earliest date possible where the presumption applies under 38 C.F.R. § 3.320.  The Veteran has asserted that an earlier effective date is warranted because the evidence shows that his disability can be tied to his military service on a direct rather than just a presumptive basis.  Specifically, he asserts that his disability had its onset in service and has persisted since service.  

As an initial inquest, the Board reviewed the record to determine the earliest possible informal or formal claim for service connection for allergic rhinitis.  The Veteran separated from service in November 2017.  A claim for service connection was not received within one year of the date of discharge.  

On February 28, 2020, VA received an Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA From 21-526EZ), in which the Veteran sought service connection for allergic rhinitis, which was continuously pursued through the November 2023 rating decision currently on appeal.  

On review of the record, the Board can point to no communication dated prior to the February 2020, claim that could be interpreted as a claim for service connection for allergic rhinitis.  Thus, February 28, 2020, serves as the earliest potential claim for service connection for allergic rhinitis.  

Thus, the Board will turn to the record to determine the earliest possible date that entitlement for service connection for allergic rhinitis arose.  Service treatment records are silent for treatment for or a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis or a nose condition of any kind.  Absent evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, there can be no entitlement shown.  

Generally, in order to show a service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12?Vet. App.?341 (1999). 

VA treatment records show diagnosis of allergic rhinitis in October 2020. 

For the sake of argument, even if there was evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, the finding of entitlement was based on a change in law creating a presumption of service connection.  Prior to the change, no nexus was factually established, and so entitlement was not shown except by operation of the liberalizing law effective August 5, 2021.  This is the earliest allowable date effective under 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 and is consistent with the date entitlement was first shown.  Again, by operation of the regulation, the later date of the date entitlement arose (with consideration under 38 C.F.R. § 3.114) controls.  

The Board acknowledges and has considered the Veteran's argument that a private medical opinion submitted in March 2022 establishes a nexus to his service on a direct basis; however, even assuming a positive March 2022 establishment of nexus, the Board's conclusion is not affected.  The proper effective date is either the date of the claim, February 28, 2020, or the date entitlement arose, August 5, 2021, whichever is later.  

Accordingly, the claim for an effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis must be denied. 

2. An effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the grant of service connection for sinusitis is denied.  

The Veteran filed a claim of service connection for sinusitis in February 2020, which was granted in an October 2021 rating decision based on the legal presumptions related to toxic exposures in service.  The Regional Office assigned a rating of 10 percent from August 5, 2021, the earliest possible date where the presumption applies under 38 C.F.R. 3 320.  A February 2023 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim for an effective date prior to August 5, 2021.  On November 22, 2021, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, seeking an effective date prior to August 5, 2021.  A February 2023 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim for an effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis.  On August 4, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher Level Review, continuing pursuit of his claim for an effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the grant of service connection for sinusitis.  The Veteran has asserted that an earlier effective date is warranted because the evidence shows that his disability can be tied to his military service on a direct rather than just a presumptive basis.  Specifically, he asserts that his disability had its onset in service and has persisted since service.  

As an initial inquest, the Board reviewed the record to determine the earliest possible informal or formal claim for service connection for sinusitis.  The Veteran separated from service in November 2017.  A claim for service connection was not received within one year of the date of discharge.

Thus, the Board will turn to the record to determine the earliest possible date that entitlement for service connection for allergic rhinitis arose.  

Generally, in order to show a service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12?Vet. App.?341 (1999). 

VA treatment records show diagnosis of chronic maxillary sinusitis and chronic ethmoid sinusitis November 2016.  Service treatment records are silent for treatment for or a diagnosis of sinusitis.  Absent evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, there can be no entitlement shown.  

For the sake of argument, even if there was evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, the finding of entitlement was based on a change in law creating a presumption of service connection.  Prior to the change, no nexus was factually established, and so entitlement was not shown except by operation of the liberalizing law effective August 5, 2021.  This is the earliest allowable date effective under 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 and is consistent with the date entitlement was first shown.  Again, by operation of the regulation, the later date of the date entitlement arose (with consideration under 38 C.F.R. § 3.114) controls.

The proper effective date is either the date of the claim, February 28, 2020, or the date entitlement arose, August 5, 2021, whichever is later.  

Accordingly, the claim for an effective date prior to August 5, 2021, for the grant of service connection for sinusitis must be denied.
