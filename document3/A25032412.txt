ISSUE

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension.

ORDER

Entitlement to an initial 10 percent disability rating, but no higher, for hypertension is GRANTED.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran requires continuous medication for controlling his blood pressure with a history of diastolic blood pressure which has been 100 or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for service-connected hypertension are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army National Guard from July 2022 to August 2023. The matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 RO decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Legal Criteria

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is in turn based on the average impairment of earning capacity caused by a given disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the evaluations to be assigned to the various disabilities.

Where, as here, the appeal arises from the original assignment of a disability rating following an award of service connection, the severity of the disability at issue is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time.

If there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

If different disability ratings are warranted for different periods of time over the life of a claim, "staged" ratings may be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).

In accordance with sections 4.1 and 4.2 of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations and Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991), the Board has reviewed all evidence of record pertaining to the history of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. The Board has found nothing in the historical record which would lead to the conclusion that the current evidence of record is not adequate for rating purposes.

Additionally, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Additionally, the evaluation of the same disability under several Diagnostic Codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury only where the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

The Board is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Hypertension is rated pursuant to section 4.104 of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension). Under DC 7101, a 10 percent disability rating requires diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or that an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more requires continuous medication for control. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

A 20 percent disability rating requires diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. Id. A 40 percent disability rating requires diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. Id. A 60 percent disability rating requires diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. Id.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common." Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

In rating hypertension under DC 7101, the Board may consider the blood pressure readings taken while a veteran is using medication as such consideration is part of the diagnostic criteria. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (the Board may properly consider ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication in adjudicating claims for increased ratings for hypertension, because medication is specifically mentioned in DC 7101).

Analysis

The Veteran generally contends that his service-connected hypertension is more severe than contemplated by the currently assigned noncompensable rating.

The Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in October 2022 and first received a prescription for Lisinopril to manage the disability in February 2023. See Service Treatment Records. During that time, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded six times. In October 2022, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as 142/96 and 152/102. In November 2022, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as 142/100, 166/125, and 152/101. In February 2023, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as 148/100. 

Following the Veteran's Lisinopril prescription, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded six more times during the period on review. In March 2023, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as 144/92. In April 2023, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as 118/68. In May 2023, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as 142/98. Then, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in April 2024, during which the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as 145/87, 142/75, and 136/80. 

During the four months the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension but was not yet medicated for the disability, the Veteran's diastolic blood pressure was predominantly 100 or more. In fact, of the six blood pressure readings of record during this time, only one diastolic blood pressure reading was below 100. Additionally, the Veteran requires continuous medication for control of his blood pressure. See April 2024 VA examination.

Having a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more which requires continuous medication for control corresponds to the 10 percent disability rating criteria. Therefore, an initial 10 percent disability rating is granted for hypertension. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

The Veteran's diastolic blood pressure is not predominantly 110 or more. Only one diastolic reading, from November 2022, measured more than 110 during the period on review. Further, the Veteran's systolic blood pressure is not predominantly 200 or more. None of the recorded systolic blood pressure readings reach the threshold of 200 during the period on review. Therefore, an initial rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted.

The Veteran has only been diagnosed with hypertension, which is specifically covered by Diagnostic Code 7101. As such, it would be inappropriate to rate this disability by analogy to any other Diagnostic Codes. Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 336-37 (2015) ("the Court reiterates that when a condition is specifically listed in the Schedule, it may not be rated by analogy"). Thus, consideration of any alternative Diagnostic Codes is not warranted in this case.

The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017).

For the reasons set forth above, the evidence persuasively shows the Veteran is entitled to an initial disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for hypertension. As the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). An initial disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for hypertension is granted.
