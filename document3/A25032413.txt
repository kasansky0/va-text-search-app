ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 23, 2016, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for migraines is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an April 2011 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for a traumatic brain injury (TBI) with tension headaches effective March 1, 2011. The Veteran did not appeal the April 2011 rating decision or submit additional evidence within one year of notice of that decision.

2. On May 23, 2016 the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) ordered a "routine future exam" to determine the current level of severity for the Veteran's TBI disability. 

3. The Veteran provided good cause for his failure to report to June 2016 and February 2018 VA examinations.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for earlier effective date of May 23, 2016, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for migraines have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(c), 3.303, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2008 to February 2011. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the AOJ. 

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the December 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and returned the claim to the AOJ for additional development. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 23, 2016 for the grant of service connection for migraine is granted.

The Veteran contends that he should be awarded an effective date of March 1, 2011 for the grant of service connection for migraines. See June 2024 VA Form 10182. 

Unless specifically provided otherwise by statute, the effective date of an award for compensation benefits based on (1) an original claim, (2) a claim reopened after final adjudication, or (3) a claim for increase, is the date VA received the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999). If service connection is granted based on a claim received within one year of separation from active duty, the effective date will be the day following separation. Id.

In an April 2011 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for a TBI with tension headaches effective March 1, 2011, which is one day after the Veteran's separation from active service. 

On May 23, 2016, and without a filing from the Veteran, the AOJ ordered a "routine future exam" to determine the current level of severity for the Veteran's TBI disability.

On June 9, 2016 it was noted that the Veteran's TBI VA examination was cancelled due to his failure to report for the examination. 

In a June 2016 rating decision, the AOJ proposed to reduce the Veteran's TBI disability from 70 percent to 0 percent. 

In August 2016 correspondence sent to the Veteran's mailing address, to include a letter notifying the Veteran that he had an option to undergo a new TBI examination by an appropriate specialist, was returned as undeliverable. 

In March 2018 the Veteran was noted as a no show for his scheduled VA examination. 

In a July 2019 rating decision, the Veteran's TBI disability was decreased to 0 percent effective October 1, 2019. 

In February 2020 the Veteran submitted a request for higher level review for the July 2019 rating decision. 

In a June 2020 rating decision, the AOJ found that the reduction of the TBI from 70 percent to 0 percent was correct. 

In July 2020 the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim seeking review of the June 2020 rating decision. He stated that he had moved to Brazil and did not receive any correspondence from the VA since. He reported that his stateside address was with an aunt. She did not inform him of any letters, and he had lost contact with her. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his TBI and headaches in October 2020. 

In a January 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for migraines effective October 17, 2020, which is the date of the VA examination. 

The Veteran's headache disability claim arose in connection to the AOJ's request for a VA examination to determine the current severity of his TBI disability on May 23, 2016. As noted above, the Veteran was scheduled for two VA examinations prior to the October 17, 2020 VA examination. The Veteran explained that he was out of the country and did not receive notice of the VA examinations. Further, correspondence sent to the address of record was returned as undeliverable, and there is no evidence in the record that the Veteran was provided notice of the June 2016 and February 2018 VA examinations. Therefore, the Board finds entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 23, 2016 is warranted. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that he should be awarded an effective date of March 1, 2011 for his migraine disability. The Veteran asserts that his migraines were part of the original claim for residuals of head trauma filed on his original application for compensation on December 15, 2010. He argues that the April 2011 rating decision failed to assign a separate evaluation for headaches stemming from his TBI, and that since none of the symptoms for his TBI and migraine disability overlap it was proper to assign a separate evaluation to compensate for his severe recurring headaches in the April 2011 rating decision. See June 2024 VA Form 10182. 

The April 2011 rating decision granted the Veteran service connection for TBI with tension headaches. The Veteran did not appeal or submit additional evidence within one year of this determination. Therefore, the April 2011 rating decision became final and is not subject to revision in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the decision. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A, 7105 (2012); see Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006). Although the Veteran expresses disagreement with the April 2011 rating decision, he does not allege CUE. Therefore, the April 2011 rating decision is final and not subject to revision by the Board. 

Based on the above, the Board finds entitlement to an effective date of May 23, 2016, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for migraines is warranted.
