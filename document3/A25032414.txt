REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force from January 1977 to December 1980 and from March 1981 to June 1994. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

In April 2023, the Veteran wrote that she injured her right knee when she fell during active service.  She explained that her right knee pain has persisted since her active service.  In August 2023, the AOJ made favorable findings which conceded the Veteran's in-service complaints for right knee pain and the Veteran's current right knee disability.  Therefore, the issue before the Board is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current right knee disability and conceded in-service right knee injury. 

Unfortunately, the nexus opinion that was obtained prior to the August 2023 rating decision is inadequate, because it is not supported by adequate rationale.  In August 2023, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right knee disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The VA examiner did not address the Veteran's contentions regarding ongoing knee pain since active service or provide an explanation for why the Veteran's right knee disability was not at least as likely as not related to her conceded in-service knee injury.  Therefore, a remand is required to obtain an adequate medical opinion that addresses the etiology of the Veteran's right knee disability.  The failure to obtain an adequate examination constitutes a predecisional duty to assist error.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's right knee disability is at least as likely as not related to active service, to include her in-service complaints of right knee pain.  In rendering the opinion, the VA examiner must 

?

address the Veteran's competent and credible statements regarding ongoing knee pain since active service.
