DOCKET NO. 240807-462107
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The claim for an effective date prior to February 26, 2019, for the award of service connection for bipolar II disorder with major depression (psychiatric disorder) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a June 2019 rating decision, the VA Regional Office (RO) notified the Veteran that service connection for bipolar disorder II with major depression was awarded, effective February 26, 2019.  The Veteran did not disagree with the effective date of that award within a year of that notification.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran's request for entitlement to an earlier effective date than February 26, 2019, for the grant of service connection for bipolar disorder II with major depression is not a legally recognizable claim and raises no question to be decided. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2010 to October 2012.  This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from June 2019 and January 2024 rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Earlier Effective Date

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date in 2012 or 2013 for the award of service connection for a psychiatric disorder.  He asserts an earlier date is warranted because his psychiatric disorder had manifested around those years.  See January 2024 statement.  

The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for bipolar disorder and major depression in March 2019.  In June 2019, the RO issued a decision that granted service connection for bipolar II disorder with major depression and assigned an initial 100 percent disability rating, effective February 26, 2019.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and it became final.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

The Board observes that the Veteran's contention regarding the effective date for service connection for his psychiatric disorder essentially constitutes a "freestanding" claim for an earlier effective date of service connection.

In Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299-300 (2006), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that once a rating decision that establishes an effective date for an award becomes final, the only way that such a decision can be revised is if it contains clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  The Court noted that any other result would vitiate the rule of finality.  In other words, the Court found that there is no valid freestanding claim for an earlier effective date.  The Court held that if a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date is raised, an appeal in the matter should be dismissed.

Here, the June 2019 rating decision was not appealed and became final.  To the extent that the Veteran's appeal seeks an effective date prior to February 26, 2019, he has not presented a valid claim.  See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 300.  In Rudd, the Court further indicated that because "there is no proper claim," the matter must be dismissed.  Id.

The Veteran may change the disposition of the June 2019 rating decision if he successfully achieves revision of the rating decision on the basis of CUE.  The Veteran has not alleged CUE in the June 2019 rating decision and the record does not show that any such CUE claim has been filed.  If the Veteran believes the June 2019 rating decision contains CUE, the Board encourages him to file a CUE claim.

Accordingly, the Board has no alternative but to dismiss this appeal for failure to present a valid claim.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
