2. On August 29, 2024, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ordered the processing of the disbursement of funds in the amount of $15,556.86, to be released to the attorney in the full amount of 20 percent of the past-due benefits awarded by the June 2024 decision that assigned an earlier effective date for the award of Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits.
