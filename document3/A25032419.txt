ISSUE

Entitlement to a waiver of overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits in the amount of $109,184.07, to include the issue of the validity of the debt.

REMANDED

The issue of entitlement to a waiver of overpayment of VA benefits in the amount of $109,184.07, to include the issue of validity of the debt is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from October 1973 to September 1977.

This matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to a waiver of overpayment of VA benefits in the amount of $109,184.07, to include the issue of the validity of the debt

The Veteran contends that the overpayment debt created due to the retroactive termination of benefits as a result of his felony incarceration is not valid because he notified VA of his incarceration and VA continued to issue payments to a bank account to which he no longer had access.  See March 2023 correspondence; April 2024 VA Form 10182.  He contends that he filed a police report because he was the victim of identity theft during his incarceration.  See October 2023 submission of Police Report.  Alternatively, he requests a waiver of the overpayment debt because repayment would cause undue financial hardship and he did not use any of the money.  See March 2023 correspondence. 

A January 2019 VA Form 27-0820e (Report of Incarceration) indicates that the Veteran was incarcerated on May 19, 2018, pending trial, for a felony offense. 

A June 2022 Social Security Administration (SSA) Bureau of Prisons match indicates that the Veteran was released from incarceration on April 18, 2022. 

A Norfolk Circuit- Criminal Division website print out indicates that on January 15, 2019, the Veteran entered a guilty plea to a felony offense and was sentenced on May 10, 2019 to 5 years incarceration, with 2 years and 6 months suspended. 

A June 2022 VA Form 21-4193 (Notice of Department of Veterans Affairs of Veteran Incarcerated in Penal Institution) indicates that the Veteran was released on April 18, 2022.  

The Board construes the Veteran's statements as a challenge to the validity of the debt.

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) has not addressed the issue of the validity of the overpayment debt. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board may remand for correction of either a pre-decisional duty to assist error or "any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim." See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. In Schaper v. Derwinski, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) decided it was an error to fail to first adjudicate validity of debt based on the statutory and regulatory waiver consideration of "equity and good conscious." Id. at 437; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5302 (b). As such, the Board considers it a correctible error by the AOJ in satisfying its regulatory and statutory duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5302 (b) and 38 C.F.R. § 1.965 and that correction raises a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim. 

Therefore, the Board finds that a remand is necessary in order to permit the adjudication of the issue of the validity of the debt.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Adjudicate the issue of whether the overpayment in the amount of $109.184.07 was properly created and the reasons the RO found its creation to be valid.

The AOJ's attention is directed to address the following:

(a) June 2023 correspondence where the Veteran requested a hearing with a Debt Management Center (DMC) representative or COWC member; 

(b) March 2023 and October 2023 correspondences where Veteran contends that he did not have access to the bank account where VA funds were sent and that he filed a police report due to identity theft; and

(c) April 2024 VA Form 10182 where the Veteran contends that he notified VA of his incarceration in May 2019.
