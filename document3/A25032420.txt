REMANDED

Service-connection for tinnitus is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1997 until his honorable discharge in August 2004. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a June 2024 rating decision a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Given the date of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's appeal is governed by the modernized review system, known by the Board as the AMA.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2. 

On his Notice of Disagreement to the Board, the Veteran selected the direct docket.  Accordingly, the Board may only review evidence of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is remanding the claim of service-connection for tinnitus for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of those claims.

Service-connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran is seeking service-connection for tinnitus. See July 2016 VA 21-526EZ, April 2024 VA 20-0995, June 2024 VA 10182, and June 2024 Appellate Brief. 

Service connection may be granted on a direct basis as a result of disease or injury incurred in service based on nexus using a three-element test: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (a), (d); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for diseases listed in § 3.309 under the following circumstances: (1) where a chronic disease or injury is shown in service and subsequent manifestations of the same disease or injury are shown at a later date unless clearly attributable to an intercurrent cause; or (2) where there is continuity of symptomatology since service; or (3) by showing that the disorder manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.

Where the Veteran asserts entitlement to a chronic disease but there is insufficient evidence of a diagnosis in service, service connection may be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) by demonstrating a continuity of symptomatology since service, but an award solely on this basis is only permissible if the chronic disease is listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Tinnitus is recognized by VA as a "chronic disease" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), such that the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, and 3.309 apply. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).

During a May 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported having tinnitus which was constant for years. The examiner stated that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The rationale was that tinnitus etiology during active-duty service cannot be determined with reasonable certainty based on available evidence in the record or scientific knowledge. The examiner also stated that the Veteran did not have a permanent shift in hearing during his active-duty service that is consistent with reported tinnitus, there was no record of complaint or treatment of the claimed tinnitus in service records, and the Veteran's MOS was listed as having a low probability of hazardous noise exposure. The examiner relied on the wrong standard in forming their opinion. The standard is not "reasonable certainty" but at least as likely as not. 38 U.S.C. § 5107, 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The Veteran also had a threshold shift in hearing of greater than 20 decibels in his left ear. See November 2016 Service Treatment Records (STR). In June 1998, the Veteran also stated he had been exposed to continuous noise in a medical surveillance questionnaire. The examiner did not consider the Veteran's report of hazardous noise exposure and relied solely on the Veteran's MOS being listed as having a low probability of hazardous noise exposure. With regard to etiology of the Veteran's tinnitus, the examiner wrote that the Veteran reported constant tinnitus that has been present for years. Because the May 2024 VA examination is not based on an accurate record, does not consider the Veteran's lay statement about exposure to hazardous noise during his service, and applies an incorrect standard, the Board finds it inadequate. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (holding that a medical opinion obtains probative weight from "factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion"); see also Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) ("An opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value."); see also Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 262 (2020); see also Dalton v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (finding that an examination is inadequate where the examiner relied on lack of evidence in service treatment records to provide a negative opinion).

The Board also considers whether the necessary information is elsewhere in the record. Tinnitus is a condition capable of lay observation.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  The Veteran's assertion of tinnitus is competent evidence, and the Board has no reason to doubt the credibility of such assertion.  In this case, the Board finds the Veteran is competent to report the symptoms he experienced, and the Board finds his statements about tinnitus credible. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Unfortunately, while the Veteran submitted a statement about his tinnitus, he did not state when his tinnitus began. See April 2024 VA 21-4138. 

The failure to provide an adequate examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and a remand is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

Last, as the Veteran selected the "direct review" docket on his June 2024 VA 10182, the Board is unable to consider evidence which has been submitted since the date of the June 2024 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Veteran is encouraged to submit evidence that links the Veteran's disabilities to service, including but not limited to outstanding private medical treatment records, lay testimony, witness statements, and personal copies of service personnel and treatment records. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the onset of the Veteran's tinnitus.  The entire claim file, to include all electronic files, must be reviewed by the examiner.   

The examiner is to state whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset during service or is the result of the Veteran's in-service hazardous noise exposure including as related by the Veteran.
