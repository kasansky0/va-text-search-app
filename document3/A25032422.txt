FINDINGS OF FACT

There is not clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's pulmonary sarcoidosis is not due to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The severance of service connection for pulmonary sarcoidosis was improper.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.317.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1985 to August 1989 and from January 1991 to October 1991.

The case is on appeal from September 2023, November 2023, and April 2024 rating decisions.

In a May 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on that claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, for the claims being remanded, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

1. Whether the severance of service connection for pulmonary sarcoidosis was proper.

A May 2023 rating decision granted service connection for pulmonary sarcoidosis.  The rating decision explained that it considered whether the condition resulted from a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) in-service, per 38 U.S.C. 1710(e)(4), and found evidence of record showing participation in a TERA.  

A September 2023 rating decision proposed to sever service connection.  It found that there was clear and unmistakable error in the grant of service connection because a review of the file did not show service in any of the locations defined as the Southwest Asia theater of operations under the applicable laws and regulations.  

The November 2023 rating decision made the severance final.  The rating decision reiterated the basis cited in the September 2023 rating decision for severing service connection.  It also cited the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022, (PACT Act).  It explained that it considered whether the condition resulted from a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) in service, but found the evidence did not show participation in a TERA.  

The Veteran disputes the severance.  He wrote in an October 2023 statement that the findings supporting the severance did not meet the requirements to be CUE.  He argued that he was service-connected on the basis of his Gulf War service, including a finding that he was exposed to a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  He maintains that the severance was based on him not serving in the Gulf War, but he was deployed to Southwest Asia and served in the Gulf War.  This included traveling on two ships and flying to Okinawa to pick up service members, who then flew overseas.  He argues it is debatable whether he flew in the airspace over or through waters of a qualifying area of the Southwest Asia theater of operations.  He maintains there is no documentation showing he did not serve in the Southwest Asia theater of operations.  He asserts that the severance did not consider the airspace or water.  

A.  Applicable Law

Service connection will be severed only where evidence establishes that it is clearly and unmistakably erroneous (CUE) (the burden of proof being on the Government).  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(d).  

When severance of service connection is considered warranted, a rating proposing severance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons.  The claimant will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that service connection should be maintained.  Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, final rating action will be taken and the award will be reduced or discontinued, if in order, effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(d).  

A change in diagnosis may be accepted as a basis for severance action if the examining physician or physicians or other proper medical authority certifies that, in the light of all accumulated evidence, the diagnosis on which service connection was predicated is clearly erroneous.  This certification must be accompanied by a summary of the facts, findings, and reasons supporting the conclusion.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(d).  

To establish that a grant of service connection was the product of CUE, VA must show that (1) either the correct facts as they were known at the time were not before the adjudicator, the adjudicator made an erroneous factual finding, or the statutory or regulatory provisions were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error was undebatable, not merely a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated; and (3) the error manifestly changed the outcome of the prior decision.  See Allen v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 54, 58-59 (2007); Stallworth v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 482, 487-88 (2006); cf. Bustos v. West, 179 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14, 319 (1992) (en banc).  A clear and unmistakable error is one about which reasonable minds could not differ.  See, e.g., 38 C.F.R. § 20.1403(a).  

In most respects, the CUE standard for severing service connection under § 3.105(d) is equivalent to the CUE standard for reversing or revising a prior final decision under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  See Baughman v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 563, 566 (1991).  Section 3.105(d) places at least as high a burden of proof on the VA when it seeks to sever service connection as § 3.105(a) places upon an appellant seeking to have an unfavorable previous determination overturned.  See id.

However, the determination is not limited to the law and the record that existed at the time of the original decision.  VA may consider medical evidence and diagnoses that postdate the original award of service connection to demonstrate that the diagnosis on which service connection was predicated is clearly erroneous.  Stallworth, 20 Vet. App. at 488.  The Secretary's burden is not to prove clear and unmistakable error in the original decision in the same manner a claimant would show CUE under sections 5109A or 7111.  Id.

If service connection was granted on one theory that was later found to be clearly and unmistakably erroneous, the Board must address alternative theories of entitlement that are raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record before upholding severance of service connection.  McCauley v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 188, 194 (2024).  The alternative theories of entitlement must be raised by the claimant or the record.  Id. 

A decision that is reversed or amended on the basis of CUE is revised to conform to the true state of the facts or the law that existed at the time of the original adjudication.  Allen, 21 Vet. App. at 62 (internal quotations omitted).

B.  Discussion

The evidence clearly shows that the Veteran is diagnosed with this condition.  The only question in is whether he was exposed to a TERA or had service in Southwest Asia.  

The Board observes that sarcoidosis is a presumptive disease listed in 38 U.S.C. § 1120, but only for veteran's who served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations.  For purposes of resolving this issue only, the Board finds that there is not clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran did not have service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations.  

The Veteran contends that he had service in the airspace above and waterways of Southwest Asia.  The RO severed service connection based on a finding that there was no evidence verifying service in Southwest Asia.  Generally, the clear and unmistakable evidence standard must be met by "affirmative evidence" demonstrating an absence of the material fact.  The burden is not met by finding "that the record contains insufficient evidence of" that fact.  See, e.g., Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 235 (2012).  Here, VA did not meet its burden of proof sufficient to sever service connection.  

In reaching this outcome, the Board is not making a positive finding that the Veteran had service in Southwest Asia.  The Board's finding is limited to the conclusion that there is not clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran did not have service in Southwest Asia sufficient to meet VA's burden of proof to sever service connection.  

Following the November 2023 rating decision severing service connection, the RO issued a memorandum finding in November 2023 that the Veteran was exposed to a TERA.  It cited his specialty as a machine gunner, and found this exposed him to lead, gunpowder, ammunition smoke, vehicle/aircraft air carbon inhalation, burn pits, and inhalable fine/coarse particulate matter.  The Board points out that pulmonary sarcoidosis is not presumed to be due to such exposure.  However, for purposes of this issue, this factor is no longer relevant as the issue is being granted on other grounds.  

In light of the foregoing, the severance of service connection was improper, service connection is restored, and the appeal is granted.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for allergic rhinitis (claimed as sinus condition).

2. Service connection for kidney disease.

First, the Board finds that remand is needed to attempt to confirm service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations.  The Veteran contends that he flew in the qualifying airspace and transited in the waters of Southwest Asia.  The RO undertook no action to attempt to verify whether this occurred.  A remand is required to allow VA to attempt to corroborate the Veteran's report.

Second, remand for a VA examination is needed.  In a November 2023 memorandum, the RO determined that the Veteran had exposure to a TERA.  It specified that his specialty as a machine gunner exposed him to lead, gunpowder, ammunition smoke, vehicle/aircraft air carbon inhalation, burn pits, and inhalable fine/coarse particulate matter.  

Remand is needed under the PACT Act to determine if a current diagnosis is related to his TERA exposure.  

With regard to rhinitis, the Board is aware that this condition is on the list of diseases presumptively due to exposure to fine particulate matter.  However, the rhinitis must be a chronic condition.  38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(2).  Here, an August 2023 VA examiner diagnosed allergic rhinitis.  Diseases that are seasonal or acute allergic manifestations in nature are not covered diseases.  88 Fed. Reg. 60336, 60339 (Sept. 1, 2023).  Rather, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.380, service connection must be determined on the evidence as to existence prior to enlistment and, if so existent, a comparative study must be made of its severity at enlistment and subsequently.  Increase in the degree of disability during service may not be disposed of routinely as natural progress or as due to the inherent nature of the disease.  The determination as to service incurrence or aggravation must be on the whole evidentiary showing.  38 C.F.R. § 3.380.

Accordingly here, a VA opinion is needed as to whether the Veteran's condition is allergic in origin and, if so, whether a seasonal or other acute allergic manifestation.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Attempt to corroborate the Veteran's service in Southwest Asia, including the qualifying airspace and waterways.  If more details are needed, contact the Veteran to request the information.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination (or telehealth interview, review of the record, etc., if an in-person examination is not feasible) by an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the claimed rhinitis.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

(a.) Is any diagnosed condition more consistent with seasonal and other acute allergic manifestations subsiding on the absence of or removal of the allergen healing without residuals? 

i.	In answering this question, the examiner should address evidence in the service treatment records (STRs), such as a September 1991 Report of Medical History indicating a history of hay fever involving allergies since childhood.  

(b.) Is the condition at least as likely as not related to service, including exposure to lead, gunpowder, ammunition smoke, vehicle/aircraft air carbon inhalation, burn pits, and inhalable fine/coarse particulate matter?  

(c.) Is it at least as likely as not that there is a nexus between the diagnosis and the toxic exposure risk activity(ies) during service in Southwest Asia?  The examiner must consider: 

i.	The total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran; and

ii.	The synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

In answering these questions, the examiner is asked to consider the statements from the Veteran regarding his history of symptoms during and since service.  The examiner is asked to explain why his statements make it more or less likely that the current condition is related to service.  

If indicated, it should be explained whether there is a **medical** reason to believe that the Veteran's recollection of his symptoms during and after service may be inaccurate or not medically supported as the onset or cause of his current diagnosis.  Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about his symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed condition is known to develop, or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?

The examiner should not rely on silence in the medical records unless it can be explained: (a) why the silence in the available records can be taken as proof that the symptom(s) did not occur, including why the fact would have normally been recorded if present, or (b) why the absence of medical records is medically significant.

3. Schedule the Veteran for an examination (or telehealth interview, review of the record, etc., if an in-person examination is not feasible) by an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the claimed kidney condition.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

(a.) Is the condition at least as likely as not related to service?  

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not that there is a nexus between the diagnosis and the toxic exposure risk activity(ies) during service in Southwest Asia?  The examiner must consider: 

i.	The total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran; and

ii.	The synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

(c.) By history, physical examination, or laboratory testing, can the Veteran's objective indications of a disability be attributed to a known clinical diagnosis?

i.	If the signs and symptoms are not characteristic of a known clinical diagnosis, the examiner should so indicate.  There is no requirement that the examiner provide a diagnosis of undiagnosed illness.

In answering these questions, the examiner is asked to consider the statements from the Veteran regarding his history of symptoms during and since service.  The examiner is asked to explain why his statements make it more or less likely that the current condition is related to service.
