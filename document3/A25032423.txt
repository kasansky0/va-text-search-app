DOCKET NO. 240830-470444
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an insomnia disorder secondary to tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's insomnia is due to service-connected tinnitus.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus as secondary to service-connected tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from January 1979 to November 1983.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in September 2023.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for an insomnia disorder

The Veteran contends that his insomnia is the result of his tinnitus.

The Veteran has been diagnosed with an insomnia disorder by non-VA examiners in April 2023 and July 2023. Additionally, despite conducting an examination that indicated no diagnosis, a Compensation and Pension (C&P) examiner from May 2023 eventually determined that the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder. All three of these examiners also opined that the condition was secondary to the Veteran's tinnitus based on the Veteran's description of the symptoms and the timeline of how the insomnia developed.

C&P examiners in February 2023 and June 2023 provided negative opinions, stating that there was no diagnosis of this condition. Additionally, a September 2023 C&P examiner provided a negative opinion, citing some of the Veteran's statements indicating that the insomnia began during service or that associated the trouble sleeping with symptoms more indicative of anxiety.

Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for insomnia is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
