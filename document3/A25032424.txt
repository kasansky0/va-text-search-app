2. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's left knee condition manifested only in painful motion.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for a right knee condition have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes (DC) 5010-5260.

2.  The criteria for an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for a left knee condition have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes (DC) 5010-5260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from March 2003 to July 2011. 

This matter comes to the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal from an August 2022 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO). 

In the August 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the?Direct?Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the?evidence?of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.? 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was received after the rating decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in this decision.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

 Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right knee osteoarthritis is denied.

1. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left knee total arthroplasty is denied.

Disability ratings are determined by application of the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; see generally 38 C.F.R. § Part 4.  When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating applies.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability determinations.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where, as here, entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the current level of disability that is of primary concern, and VA must only address the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim for an increase was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Where, as here, the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of the assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts found, is required.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).  However, in such cases, when the factual findings show distinct time periods during which the veteran exhibits symptoms of the disability at issue, and such symptoms warrant different disability ratings, staged ratings may also be assigned.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Separate disability ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition was not "duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology" of the other condition.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).  However, pyramiding, that is the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when evaluating a Veteran's service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

VA is required to evaluate the Veteran's disability under the most appropriate rating criteria that will provide the most benefit to the Veteran.  The assignment of a particular diagnostic code is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case."  Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993).  One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology.  Any change in diagnostic code by a VA adjudicator must be specifically explained.  See Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625, 629 (1992).

It should also be noted that when evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 allows for consideration of functional loss due to pain and weakness causing additional disability beyond that reflected on range of motion measurements.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  Further, 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 provides that consideration also be given to weakened movement, excess fatigability, and incoordination.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).  This provision requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  When a flare-up is not observable on examination, an examiner must obtain information from a veteran regarding the severity, frequency, duration, and precipitating and alleviating factors of the flare-ups and the extent to which a veteran is functionally impaired during flare-ups.  Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

During the period on appeal, the Veteran was rated at 10 percent for his bilateral knee conditions, based upon painful range of motion, under Diagnostic Codes (DC) 5010-5260.  Upon review of this matter, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for the painful range of motion for his right knee osteoarthritis and left knee arthroplasty.

VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities includes several Diagnostic Codes applicable to evaluating knee and leg disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

At the outset, the Board notes that VA amended the rating criteria for musculoskeletal system disabilities effective February 7, 2021.  Here, the Veteran filed his VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, requesting increased ratings for his knee disabilities in June 2022.  Even considering a one year look back period, the amended (post February 2021) criteria would apply to the entire period on appeal in this case.

Turning to the applicable diagnostic codes (DCs), DC 5010 applies to post traumatic arthritis, while DC 5003 applies to degenerative arthritis, as established by x-ray findings.  These DCs instruct that the disability is to be rated under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved.  If there are 2 or more joints affected, each rating shall be combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.

DCs 5260 and 5261 are used to rate limitation of flexion and of extension of the knee.  Under DC 5260 limitation of flexion of the knee to 45 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating.  Limitation of flexion of the knee to 30 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating, and limitation of flexion of the knee to 15 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating.

Under DC 5261, limitation of extension of the knee to 5 degrees warrants a zero or non-compensable rating.  Limitation of extension of the knee to 10 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating.  Limitation of extension of the knee to 15 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating.  Limitation of extension of the knee to 20 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating.  Limitation of extension of the knee to 30 degrees warrants a 40 percent rating, and limitation of extension of the knee to 45 degrees warrants a 50 percent rating.

When, however, the limitation of motion of the specific joint(s) involved is noncompensable under the appropriate DC(s), a 10 percent rating is for application for each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion, to be combined, not added under DC 5003.  Limitation of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful motion.  In the absence of limitation of motion, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted if there is X-ray evidence of involvement of two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups and a 20 percent evaluation is authorized if there is X-ray evidence of involvement of two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups and there are occasional incapacitating exacerbations.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003.  Note 1 provides that the 20 percent and 10 percent ratings based on X-ray findings, above, will not be combined with ratings based on limitation of motion.

Turning to the evidence of record, July 2022 private treatment records noted that the Veteran had utilized corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid injections to treat his left knee without much relief.  He reported that the pain was persistent.  He worked as a developer for FedEx and was often on his feet for prolonged periods of the day.  He experienced swelling and could not move his knee at times at the end of the day.  The Veteran denied instability or mechanical symptoms.  A July 2022 radiology report for the left knee noted there was no joint effusion, fracture, or dislocation.  There was evidence of severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination to evaluate his knees in July 2022.  He was diagnosed with right knee osteoarthritis and left knee tricompartmental arthritis with Osgood-Schlatter's disease.  The Veteran confirmed flareups.  His baseline level of pain in the right knee was reported as 2 to 3/10.  The pain was sharp and aggravated by turning, standing or walking on concrete, or prolonged sitting.  The pain could increase to 7 to 8/10 up to twice a week.  Left knee pain was rated as 4 to 5/10.  This pain interfered with sitting, standing, utilizing stairs, and was aggravated by movement or prolonged immobility.  The pain increased to 9 to 10/10 every day for several hours.  The Veteran denied recurrent subluxation of the knee but did note frequent effusion of both knees.  The Veteran was capable of flexion to 100 degrees and extension to zero degrees in both knees.  Pain resulted in functional limitation with flexion further limited to 80 degrees bilaterally.  Passive range of motion testing produced identical results.  The Veteran was capable of repetitive use testing without additional loss in range of motion.  Pain due to flareups limited flexion to 90 degrees bilaterally.  There was no evidence of muscle atrophy or ankylosis in either knee.  

There was no evidence of recurrent subluxation, persistent instability, or ligament tear in either knee.  The Veteran had not been diagnosed with a recurrent patellar dislocation, shin splints, stress fractures, or any other tibial or fibular impairment.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had a right and left knee meniscal condition that resulted in frequent episodes of joint locking and pain.  The Veteran had a meniscectomy in the left knee in 1996 and in the right knee in 2009.  The examiner did not respond to whether there were any residuals.  There was intermittent use of a brace, especially for the left knee.  The examiner noted that the Veteran may have at least moderate impairment working in a physically demanding environment, requiring prolonged weightbearing of more than 40 pounds, squatting, kneeling, and lifting.  He would struggle to tolerate repeated use of stairs or ladders. 

An addendum VA opinion was obtained in August 2022.  The examiner clarified that the Veteran did not have any meniscal conditions.  The meniscus symptoms noted in the July 2022 VA examination were symptoms that the Veteran had experienced prior to the meniscectomies.  There were no current meniscal conditions or residuals noted.  

Applying the rating criteria, the Veteran is not entitled to a compensable rating under DC 5260 for reduced flexion.  His bilateral knee flexion was at worst 80 degrees, which is still much higher than the minimum necessary for a compensable rating under this diagnostic code.  Extension was normal at zero degrees; thus, the Veteran was not entitled to a compensable rating under DC 5261. 

Additionally, there is no evidence of ankylosis (immobility of the knee joint), nor does the evidence nearly approximate ankylosis, as the Veteran had full extension as well as a significant degree of flexion, albeit reduced from the full range.  Thus, no rating is applicable under DC 5256.

The Board has considered whether a separate disability rating is available under another diagnostic code pertaining to the knee; however, the medical evidence of record does not show that the Veteran reported or experienced nonunion or malunion of any bone, recurrent subluxation, persistent instability, genu recurvatum, nor a meniscus condition.  Nor would application of DC 5003, for arthritis shown by X-ray, provide the Veteran a higher rating.  Thus, although a 10 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's knee disabilities, the Board concludes that the Veteran's symptoms did not cause the level of impairment required for higher disability ratings pertaining to the knees.
