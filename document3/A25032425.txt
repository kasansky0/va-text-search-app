DOCKET NO. 240828-470274
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT 

The Veteran's COPD is related to in-service exposure to diesel fuel and solvents. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for COPD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1979 to January 1993.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

On January 4, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 3, 2024, decision. On January 5, 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 3, 2024, decision. Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the January 4, 2024, VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. After additional development, the claim was again denied in the March 2024 rating decision on appeal. 

In the January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

A veteran seeking compensation under these provisions must establish three elements: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). 

Service Connection for COPD

The Veteran seeks service connection for COPD. He asserts that his COPD was caused by in-service exposure to harmful chemicals and toxic diesel fumes. See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim. 

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal contains the following favorable findings which are confirmed for the record: (1) Participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) is conceded, to include exposure to hazardous diesel fuels and solvents, and (2) a current diagnosis of COPD is confirmed. See March 2024 rating decision. Therefore, the remaining question is whether the evidence establishes a nexus between the Veteran's COPD and TERA.

A February 2024 examiner opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's COPD is caused by the conceded in-service TERA. The examiner explained that COPD is typically caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, asthma, occupational exposure to dust and chemicals, exposure to fuels from burning fuels, and genetics. Nevertheless, the examiner concluded that there is no substantial medical literature to support the Veteran's TERA can lead to COPD. 

Although the February 2024 examiner concluded that there is no substantial medical literature to support the Veteran's TERA can lead to COPD, the medical opinion explained that "COPD is typically caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter," and that risks factors include "occupational exposure to chemicals," and "exposure to fuels from burning fuels." Indeed, VA has conceded the Veteran's in-service exposure to hazardous diesel fuels and solvents, which are "fuels from burning fuels" and "chemicals," respectively. 

The February 2024 examiner did not specifically address the Veteran's exposure to hazardous diesel fuels and solvents. In this regard, it remains unclear why the examiner reached negative conclusion, given the apparent positive rationale and the Veteran's conceded in-service exposures. The Board finds the relevant medical rationale is adequate and highly probative and affords it substantial evidentiary weight. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008).

For the above reasons, the Board resolves any remaining reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and concludes that the Veteran's COPD is related to diesel fuel and solvents exposure during service. Accordingly, service connection for COPD is warranted.
