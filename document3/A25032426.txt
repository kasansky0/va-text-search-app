REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1989 to April 1991.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following his appeal of a December 2023 rating decision.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the December 2023 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, as a remand of the Veteran's claims is required, any such evidence will be considered by the AOJ on remand.

1. Entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for GERD is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids is remanded.

The Board must remand an appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A if the error occurred prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. These claims must be remanded for correction of the following pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The AOJ requested VA examinations and opinions in conjunction with these claims. The Veteran's claims file contains a November 4, 2023 Appointment Notification letter addressed to the Veteran, which was associated with the claims file on December 13, 2023. While the letter provides a date and time for the VA examinations, it does not provide an address for the location of the examinations. December 2023 claims documents state that the VA examination scheduling requests for the Veteran's claims were cancelled, with a stated reason that the Veteran was a "no show." In the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ stated that the Veteran failed to report for the examinations and the evidence showed no good cause for the failure to report. The Board finds that the November 4, 2023 Appointment Notification letter did not provide clear information as to the location of the examinations and whether the Veteran was to appear in person, and further finds that the AOJ erred in not affording the Veteran another opportunity to attend examinations in light of those deficiencies. This pre-decisional duty to assist error must be corrected on remand.  

Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

The claim for a TDIU is inextricably intertwined with the service connection claims being remanded herein, as an allowance of any of the claims could affect entitlement to a TDIU. Thus, adjudication of the issue of entitlement to a TDIU would be premature, and that claim must also be remanded. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (issues are "inextricably intertwined" when a decision on one issue would have a "significant impact" on a veteran's claim for the second issue).

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

Reschedule the Veteran's examinations for chronic fatigue, GERD, and hemorrhoids.
