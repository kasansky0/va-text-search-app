DOCKET NO. 240709-454006
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

An earlier effective date of February 19, 2022, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.  

FINDING OF FACT

An October 2018 rating decision denied service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, the Veteran did not appeal the decision, and it became final.  After the October 2018 rating decision, the first communication from the Veteran to file a claim of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea was submitted on a VA Form 21-526EZ and received by VA on February 19, 2022.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of February 19, 2022, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, have been met.  38 U.S.C.           §§ 5102, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from April 2008 to April 2009, from August 2009 to August 2010 and from June 2011 to March 2013.  This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an October 2023 higher-level review decision that denied entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to June 21, 2022, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  [The Board notes that a June 2022 rating decision continued the previous denial of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, and on January 30, 2023, (within one year of the June 2022 rating decision) VA received the Veteran's supplemental claim seeking service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  A May 2023 rating decision granted service connection for obstructive sleep apnea at 50 percent, effective January 30, 2023, and in June 2023, the Veteran submitted a request for higher level review of the May 2023 rating decision.  Subsequently, a July 2023 rating decision found a clear and unmistakable error in the effective date assigned for obstructive sleep apnea and assigned an earlier effective date of June 21, 2022, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.]  In his July 2024 appeal to the Board of the October 2023 higher-level review decision (on VA Form 10182), the Veteran selected the direct review option.  Therefore, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 rating decision.  

An earlier effective date of February 19, 2022, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.  

The effective date of an award based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110.  

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection will be the date of receipt of the claim or petition to reopen, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

The regulation also allows a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim, so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year.              38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  An intent to file a claim can be submitted in one of the following three ways: (1) saved electronic application; (2) written intent on prescribed intent to file a claim form; or (3) an oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel and recorded in writing.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  Otherwise, a desire to file a claim is treated as a request for application for benefits.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  

A claimant can preserve his or her effective date by continuously pursuing a claim or issue.  This is accomplished by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) decision as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision (or the time period specified in § 3.2500(f), as applicable to simultaneously contested claims), provided that any appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must be accepted as timely by that court.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  

If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c).  

The available review options to establish continuous pursuit depend on the type of decision that was issued.  Regarding a rating decision on an initial or supplemental claim, the appropriate review options are to file a supplemental claim, request higher-level review, or file a VA Form 10182, Board appeal.  

The Veteran's attorney argues that an earlier effective date is warranted for the award of service connection because the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ that was received by VA on February 19, 2022.  Although the Regional Office (RO) requested that the claim be filed on the proper form in June 2022, the Veteran's attorney asserts that they cured this defect by filing the proper form within one year.  

The Board notes that the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea in April 2018, which was denied in an October 2018 rating decision.  The Veteran did not initiate an appeal, and no new and material evidence was received within one year under the legacy review system; as such, it became final.  

On February 19, 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, which listed the claim of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  

A February 22, 2022, VA letter to Veteran notes that an intent to filed was received on February 19, 2022.  

In a June 15, 2022, VA letter, the Veteran was informed that since his claim for obstructive sleep apnea was previously denied, he would need to submit his request on the proper form.  This letter explained how the new modernized review system worked and provided a chart with information about the appropriate forms.  

On June 21, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting to reopen his claim of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  

Thereafter, a June 2022 rating decision continued the previous denial of service connection for sleep apnea.  On January 30, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting to reopen his claim of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  A May 2023 rating decision granted service connection for obstructive sleep apnea at 50 percent, effective January 30, 2023.  In June 2023, the Veteran submitted his request for higher level review of the May 2023 rating decision.

A July 2023 rating decision notes that clear and unmistakable error was found in the effective date assigned for obstructive sleep apnea and an earlier effective date of June 21, 2022, was assigned, and an October 2023 higher-level review decision denied entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to June 21, 2022, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  

The law states the proper effective date is the date of the petition to reopen, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  In this case, the later of the dates is in 2022, since the 2018 rating decision became final.  Thus, the question for the Board is which date in 2022 is the appropriate effective date here.  

Based on the evidence above, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is warranted.  The Board has considered the representative's argument and agrees.  In this case, the Veteran clearly conveyed on the February 19, 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ that he sought service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  Although the Board agrees with the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that this claim was not filed on a proper form, since the claim was previously denied and that decision became final, the Veteran submitted his written intention, and this was on a form prescribed by the Secretary of VA.  For these reasons, the Board finds 38 C.F.R. 3.155(b)(1) satisfied and thus, finds that the February 19, 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ is an intent to file a claim for obstructive sleep apnea.  

Given that VA received the completed VA Form 20-0995 in June 2022, which is within one year of the February 2022 form, the Board finds the intent completed.  The form was received by VA on February 19, 2022, the date an intent to file for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  As such, this is the earliest date afforded by 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, based on a petition to reopen.  

The Board then has to consider if the Veteran was able to preserve February 19, 2022, as the earliest effective date in light of subsequent rating decisions and an additional filing of a supplemental claim.  As noted above, a June 2022 rating decision continued the denial of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, and on January 30, 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim.  Since he filed a supplemental claim within a year of the June 2022 rating decision, the Veteran continuously pursued the claim and was able to preserve the February 19, 2022, effective date.  Thereafter, in response to the supplemental claim, in May 2023 service connection for obstructive sleep apnea was granted, and a July 2023 rating decision assigned an earlier effective date of June 21, 2022.  

As noted above, the Board finds that February 19, 2022, was the earliest date afforded by 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, based on a petition to reopen, and because the Veteran continuously pursued the claim by timely filing supplemental claims throughout the period on appeal, he was able to preserve that affective date.  

Therefore, resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, an effective date of February 19, 2022, but not earlier, is granted for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.
