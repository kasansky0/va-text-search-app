REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1989 to April 1991.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following his appeal of a December 2023 rating decision.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the December 2023 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, as a remand of the Veteran's claim is required, any such evidence will be considered by the AOJ on remand.

Entitlement to service connection for ED is remanded.

The Board must remand an appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A if the error occurred prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. This claim must be remanded for correction of the following pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The AOJ requested a VA examination and opinion in conjunction with this claim. The Veteran's claims file contains a November 4, 2023 Appointment Notification letter addressed to the Veteran, which was associated with the claims file on December 13, 2023. While the letter provides a date and time for the VA examination, it does not provide an address for the location of the examination. A December 2023 claims document states that the VA examination scheduling request for the Veteran's claim was cancelled, with a stated reason that the Veteran was a "no show." In the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ stated that the Veteran failed to report for the examination and the evidence showed no good cause for the failure to report. The Board finds that the November 4, 2023 Appointment Notification letter did not provide clear information as to the location of the examination and whether the Veteran was to appear in person, and further finds that the AOJ erred in not affording the Veteran another opportunity to attend an examination in light of those deficiencies. This pre-decisional duty to assist error must be corrected on remand.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Reschedule the Veteran's examination for erectile dysfunction.
