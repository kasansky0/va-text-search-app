ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for migraine headaches is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran did not experience migraine headaches with characteristic of prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for migraine headaches have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 3.400, 4.1-4.14, 4.121, 4.122, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1979 to May 1989, from January 1991 to April 1991, from March 2003 to July 2003, from October 2006 to April 2007, and from November 2007 to May 2008.???? 

A March 2024 rating?decision continued a 10 percent rating for migraines.? In April 2024, the Veteran requested a direct review of the appeal by the Board.? This case comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the March 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)?Veterans Benefits Administration Regional Office (RO), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

As the current appeal stems from the Veteran's selection of direct review, in which the Veteran acknowledged that the review will be based on the evidence submitted to VA at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue on appeal, only evidence of record as of the date of the March 2024 rating?decision will be considered.

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for migraine headaches.

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during service and the residual conditions in civil occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (a), 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The migraine headache disability has been rated pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8100 which provides ratings for migraine headaches.  Diagnostic Code 8100 provides a 10 percent rating for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring an average of once every two months over the several months.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months.  A maximum 50 percent rating is assigned for very frequent completely prostrating attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

There are several terms within Diagnostic Code 8100 that are not defined in the regulation itself but have been previously analyzed and defined by Court precedent. Prostrating means lacking in vitality or will, powerless to rise, or laid low.  Thus, because Diagnostic Code 8100 specifically governs migraine headaches, the phrase characteristic prostrating attacks plainly describes migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality.  The modifier completely, as used before prostrating in the 50 percent criteria, meant that the Veteran must be made entirely powerless and productive of severe economic inadaptability means either producing or capable of producing severe economic inadaptability.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018); Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440 (2004). 

In rating headaches or migraines under Diagnostic Code 8100, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).

The current claim on appeal stems from an initial grant of service connection for migraine headaches.  Therefore, the period currently on appeal is January 16, 2023, the date service connection was established for migraines, to March 4, 2024, the date of the rating decision on appeal.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased rating for a service-connected migraine disability, currently rated 10 percent, effective January 16, 2023, pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8100.  

In a January 2023 statement, the Veteran reported headaches occurring when his psychiatric symptoms were at their worst.  The Veteran reported the headaches occurring two to three times per week, generally consisting of pain on both sides of the head.  The Veteran stated that, at least once a month, the headaches left him totally incapacitated and unable to do normal daily activities for 8 hours.  During the migraines, the Veteran reported having light sensitivity, noise sensitivity, visual spots, flashing or shimmering lights, blind spots, nausea, vertigo, and pulsating pain.  The Veteran used ibuprofen to treat the symptoms. 

At a June 2023 VA headache examination, the headache condition was described as stable with no progression noted.  The Veteran reported experiencing photophobia and phonophobia, once a month, lasting one day.  The examiner stated that the last documented migraine notation was from May 3, 2021, and noted migraine headaches once every two to three weeks that had been better as stress had been stabilized.  The Veteran treated the headaches with ibuprofen, as needed.  On examination, the Veteran was found to have headache pain on both sides of the head, consisting of head pressure radiating to both temples, resulting in sensitivity to light and sound, typically lasting less than one day.  The Veteran was not found to have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine and non-migraine headache.  During the examination, the Veteran's condition was found to impact the Veteran's ability to concentrate on migraine days, if the medication failed, slowing productivity.  The Veteran was noted as missing one week of work in the last 12 months as a result of the condition. 

The Board finds that the service-connected migraine headaches do not warrant a rating in excess of 10 percent.  The symptoms the Veteran experienced do not more nearly approximate those described under the criteria for a 30 percent rating.  While the evidence shows that the Veteran had frequent headaches, the weight of the evidence does not show that the frequent headaches were characteristic of prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months.  After considering the evidence, the Board finds that the migraine symptoms did not typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality in the Veteran but rather caused some difficulty in concentration.  Additionally, during examination, the condition was noted as being stable and no examiner found the Veteran to have characteristic prostrating attacks of head pain.  Therefore, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted for migraine headaches. 

The Board acknowledges that while the Veteran may believe his symptoms are more severe than contemplated by the currently assigned disability rating, he does not possess the medical expertise to make such an assessment.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  While the Board recognizes that the Veteran is competent to describe symptomatology and resulting functional impairment, he is not competent to provide an opinion regarding the severity of his symptoms in accordance with the rating criteria. Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007).  Therefore, the Veteran's lay assertions are not considered more persuasive than the medical findings which do not support the assignment of a higher rating for migraine headaches.  The Board finds the medical evidence in which professionals with specialized expertise examined the Veteran, acknowledged his reported symptoms, and described the manifestations of the disability in light of the rating criteria to be more persuasive than the Veteran's own reports regarding the severity of his disability.

The Board has considered the severity of the headaches without regard to ameliorative medication, and finds that the evidence does not show characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months.  The Board finds that the evidence does not show that without medication the Veteran would have characteristic prostrating attacks once per month.

The Board is appreciative of the Veteran's faithful and honorable service.  However, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates an initial disability rating of 10 percent for migraine headaches, and not higher, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.  The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the assignment of any higher ratings.  As the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the assignment of any higher ratings, the claim for any higher ratings must be and is denied.  The Board finds that there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
