ORDER

The appeal concerning whether the rating reduction from 30 percent to 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with Barrett's syndrome, effective May 26, 2021, is proper, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 4, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the Veteran's authorized representative that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran's authorized representative have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1991 to August 1997.

By way of history, service connection for GERD with Barrett's syndrome was granted in a February 1998 rating decision; a 10 percent rating was assigned from August 20, 1997.

In a January 2007 Correspondence, the Veteran requested a reevaluation of his service-connected disabilities; he was afforded a VA examination in July 2007. In a July 2007 rating, the evaluation for GERD with Barrett's syndrome was increased to 30 percent from January 16, 2007.

In a January 2012 VA Form 21-526b, Veteran Supplemental Claim, the Veteran requested an increased disability rating for his service-connected GERD; he was afforded a VA examination in February 2012. In a March 2012 rating decision, the 30 percent rating was continued.

On July 30, 2017, the Veteran submitted an intent to file (ITF) a claim form.

In a January 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for gastrointestinal problems due to environmental hazard in Gulf War. He was afforded a VA Gulf War and intestinal conditions examinations in February 2018; the examiner confirmed the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis. In a February 2018 rating decision, service connection for IBS (claimed as gastrointestinal problems) due to environmental hazard in Gulf War, was denied.

In an August 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran requested to reopen his IBS claim, to include as secondary to service-connected GERD with Barrett's syndrome. The Veteran was afforded VA intestinal conditions and esophageal conditions examinations in October 2018.

In an April 2019 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) proposed to decrease the Veteran's disability rating for service-connected GERD with Barrett's syndrome from 30 percent to 10 percent; the previous denial of service connection for IBS was confirmed and continued.

In an August 2019 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran appealed the April 2019 denial of service connection for IBS.

In October 2020, the Veteran was notified of the proposed reduction for GERD with Barrett's syndrome.

In November 2020, the Veteran's representative requested a hearing for the proposed reduction. A decision review officer (DRO) hearing was held in May 2021, the parties agreed to have the Veteran re-examined for his GERD condition; a summary of the hearing is of record. The Veteran was afforded a VA esophageal examination in May 2021.

This case comes before the Board on appeal from a June 2021 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the AOJ. The June 2021 rating decision decreased the evaluation of GERD with Barrett's syndrome from 30 percent to 10 percent, effective from May 26, 2021, which was said to be the date of the VA examination showing improvement.

In his August 2021 VA Form 10182 NOD, the Veteran selected the Hearing Review Lane. In August 2022, the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing before the undersigned; a transcript of that hearing has been associated with the claims file. The Board will consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 rating decision, the hearing testimony, and evidence submitted within 90 days after the hearing.

The Board notes that in August 2023, the Board remanded the issue of entitlement to service connection for IBS to afford him another VA examination. Pursuant to the August 2023 Board remand, the Veteran was afforded a VA intestinal conditions examination in October 2023.

In a September 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for IBS, to include GERD with Barrett's syndrome; a 30 percent rating was assigned from July 30, 2017, which was said to be the date the Veteran's ITF was received. The AOJ also granted a separate evaluation for GERD with Barrett's syndrome; a 10 percent rating was assigned from May 19, 2024, which was said to be the date of the law change for this condition.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (a). An effective withdrawal of a claim on appeal must be in writing, include the name of the veteran (or claimant or appellant if other than the veteran), the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 5-7 (2020). If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue or issues withdrawn from the appeal. Hembree, 33 Vet. App. at 5.

In the present case, on March 4, 2025, the Veteran's representative at the time submitted a VA Form 20-10208, Document/Evidence Submission, stating that the Veteran wished to withdraw the issue of GERD with Barrett's syndrome. The representative further stated that this withdrawal is for the appeal filed on August 2021 for the June 2021 rating decision that decreased GERD with Barrett's syndrome to 10 percent effective May 26, 2021. The letter included the Veteran's name and Social Security number. The withdrawal of this appeal was explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011); see Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the Board must address all three prongs of the DeLisio standard when it applies).

As the Veteran, by way of his attorney, has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
