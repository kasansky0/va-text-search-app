REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1982 to June 1986.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a September 2023, October 2023, and May 2024 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. However, on June 5, 2024, the Veteran withdrew the appeal.

Appeal Withdrawal & Dismissal

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.  

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn all issues in this appeal through direct communication with VA. On June 5, 2024, prior to the Board rendering a decision in this appeal, the Veteran called and spoke with a VA representative asserting the desire to withdraw all issues currently on appeal.

The communication was memorialized on a VA 27-0820 Report of General Information prepared contemporaneously with the request. See Hanson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 29 (1996) (accepting a Report of Contact as satisfying withdrawal criteria). The request contains all requisite criteria for withdrawal in that it identifies the Veteran, the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the Veteran no longer wishes to pursue the appeal.

As such, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal; thus, dismissal is warranted.
