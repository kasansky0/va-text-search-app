DOCKET NO. 210810-178315

ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 25, 2025, prior to promulgation of a Board decision in this case, the Board received notification from the Veteran, withdrawing her appeal for service connection for PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met; the appeal for entitlement to service connection for PTSD is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 2011 to July 2011. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal from a February 2021 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  The rating decision, inter alia, found that new and relevant evidence has been received, and confirmed the previous denial of service connection for PTSD. 

In the August 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On March 25, 2025, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for PTSD. 

In a March 2025 Statement in Support of the Claim, the Veteran communicated her desire to withdraw her appeal of entitlement to service connection for PTSD. The communication included her name, file number, docket number, and a clear statement indicating her wish to withdraw the claim of service connection for PTSD.

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Accordingly, the criteria for withdrawal of the appeal have been satisfied.

When pending appeals are withdrawn, there are no longer allegations of errors of facts or laws with respect to the determinations that were appealed. In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).
