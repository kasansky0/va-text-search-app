ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic bronchitis is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for repaired right eye macula hole (right eye condition) is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left ear hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee condition is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has a current bronchitis disability.

2. The Veteran's right eye condition, at worst, is manifested by corrected 20/40 vision with no visual field defect and no incapacitating episodes in a 12-month period.

3. The Veteran's left ear hearing loss is manifested by no more than Level II hearing impairment, which corresponds to a noncompensable rating.

4. The Veteran's left knee condition, at worst, is manifested by limitation of flexion to 135 degrees and limitation of extension to five degrees.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bronchitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for a compensable initial rating for a right eye condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6066.

3. The criteria for a compensable rating for left ear hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.655, DC 6100.

4. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from October 1987 to March 1992 and December 1992 to June 1998.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). Lay testimony is competent to prove that a claimant exhibited certain lay-observable symptoms and the time that those symptoms appeared. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the Veteran. See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39 40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).

After the evidence is assembled, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. Service connection for chronic bronchitis

The Veteran contends that he has bronchitis as a result of military service.

First, the evidence shows that the Veteran had bronchitis while in service. In March 1993, October 1994, and April 1997 service medical records, it was noted that the Veteran was treated for and diagnosed with bronchitis. Thus, the Veteran has met in-service incurrence of a disease or injury element for service connection.

Turning to the current diagnosis criterion for service connection, a review of the Veteran's claims file shows that the Veteran does not have a current bronchitis condition. The Veteran underwent a VA medical examination in November 2023 and the examiner determined that the Veteran did not have any current respiratory conditions. The Veteran has also not provided any medical or lay evidence of a current disability outside of making a claim for entitlement to service connection. Therefore, the Veteran has not met the current diagnosis element for service connection.

Thus, after a full review of the record, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim for service connection for chronic bronchitis, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Disability Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a Veteran's present symptoms with the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (rating schedule), which is based on average impairment in earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

When a question arises as to which of two ratings apply under a single DC, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. As such, the Board must consider all potentially applicable DCs when rating a Veteran's disability. However, evaluation of the same manifestation of the same disability under various diagnoses, otherwise known as "pyramiding," is to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261 (1994).

It is the responsibility of the rating specialist to interpret reports of examination in the light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. Consideration of factors wholly outside the rating criteria constitutes error as a matter of law. Massey v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 204, 207-08 (1994).

2. An initial compensable rating for right eye condition

The Veteran asserts that a compensable rating for his right eye condition is warranted.

The Veteran's right eye condition is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, DC 6066. 

Evaluations of defective vision from noncompensable to 100 percent is based on organic impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.76(a), 4.79. The examination for visual impairment must be conducted by a licensed optometrist or by a licensed ophthalmologist and the examiner must identify the disease, injury, or any other pathologic found. 38 C.F.R. § 4.76(b). Examination of visual fields or muscle function will be conducted only when there is a medical indication of disease or injury that may be associated with visual field defect or impaired muscle function. Id. Unless medically contraindicated, the fundus must be examined with the Veteran's pupils dilated. Id. 

Unless otherwise directed, diseases of the eye are evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, DCs 6000-6009. Impairment of Visual Acuity is rated under DCs 6061-6066. Impairment of Visual Fields is rated under DCs 6080-6081.

The General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate on the basis of either visual impairment due to a particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation.

Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least one, but less than three treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 10 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least three, but less than five treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 20 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least five, but less than seven treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 40 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring seven or more treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 60 percent rating is warranted.

Note (1) indicates that, for the purposes of evaluations under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes. Note (2) indicates that examples of treatment may include but are not limited to: systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions. Note (3) indicates that, for the purposes of evaluating visual impairment due to a particular condition, refer to 38 C.F.R. § 4.75-4.78 and to § 4.79, DCs 6061-6091.

The Board notes that the Veteran does not assert, nor does the evidence reflect that the Veteran has had incapacitating episodes due to his right eye condition.

Examinations of visual acuity must include the central uncorrected and corrected visual acuity for distance and near vision using Snellen's test type or its equivalent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.76(a). Evaluation of central visual acuity is on the basis of corrected distance vision with central fixation, even if a central scotoma is present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.76(b). However, when the lens required to correct distance vision in the poorer eye differs by more than three diopters from the lens required to correct distance vision in the better eye (and the difference is not due to congenital or developmental refractive error), and either the poorer eye or both eyes are service connected, evaluate the visual acuity of the poorer eye using either its uncorrected or corrected visual acuity, whichever results in better combined visual acuity. Id. 

DC 6066 provides disability ratings where vision in one eye (the poorer eye) is 10/200 or better. Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 10/200, a 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 50 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200. An 80 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 15/200. A 90 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 10/200. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 15/200, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200. An 80 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 15/200. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/200, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.  A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/100, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40.  A 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.  A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70.  A 50 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/70, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40.  A 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.  A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/50, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/40, a noncompensable disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40 or better. Id.

For evaluations of restrictions in visual field(s), the examiner must use either Goldmann kinetic perimetry or automated perimetry using Humphrey Model 750, Octopus Model 101, or later versions of these perimetric devices with simulated kinetic Goldmann testing capability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.77.

Determination of the average concentric contraction of the visual field of each eye by measuring the remaining visual field (in degrees) at each of the eight principal meridians 45 degrees apart, adding them, and dividing the sum by eight. 38 C.F.R. § 4.77(b). To determine the evaluation for visual impairment when both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, separately evaluate the visual acuity and visual field defect (expressed as a level of visual acuity) and combine them under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.

DC 6080 provides disability ratings where there is a defect to the visual field. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79. Under DC 6080, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 46 to 60 degrees bilaterally, contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 16 to 60 degrees unilaterally, or the loss of the superior half or nasal half of the visual field bilaterally. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, DC 6080. A 20 percent disability rating may be awarded for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of six to 15 degrees unilaterally. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79. A 30 percent disability rating may be awarded for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining visual field of 31 to 45 degrees bilaterally, contraction of the visual field with remaining field of five degrees unilaterally, or loss of the temporal or inferior half of the visual field bilaterally. Id. A 50 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 16 to 30 degrees bilaterally. Id. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 6 to 15 degrees bilaterally. Id. Finally, a 100 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of five degrees. Id.

The Veteran underwent a December 2023 VA examination where he was diagnosed with repaired macula hole of the right eye. The examiner noted that his vision is corrected to near normal with glasses. 

The Veteran had uncorrected distance of 20/100 in the right eye and left eye and corrected distance of 20/40 in the right eye and 20/20 or better in the left eye. He did not have a documented visual field defect or diplopia. The examiner stated that in the prior 12 months, the Veteran did not experience any incapacitating episodes that was serious enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes. The examiner found that there were localized retinal scars, atrophy, or irregularities that are centrally located and result in an irregular, duplicated, enlarged, or diminished image. 

Based on the evidence above, a compensable initial disability rating for the Veteran's right eye condition is not warranted.

The Veteran's visual acuity for corrected distance is 20/40 for the right eye and 20/20 or better for the left eye which warrants a noncompensable disability rating. Additionally, the Veteran does not have any visual field defect. As noted above, the examiner found no diplopia and the Veteran did not report any incapacitating episodes for the right eye condition which required a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes which would warrant a higher rating. 

Thus, for the entire initial rating period on appeal, the Veteran's visual acuity and normal visual field shows that he does not have impairment of muscle function. This evidence is consistent with the current noncompensable rating.  

Accordingly, the weight of the evidence is against the claim for a compensable initial disability rating for a right eye condition. In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim, the doctrine is not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

3. An initial compensable rating for left ear hearing loss

The Veteran contends that his left ear hearing loss is more severe than currently rated.

In evaluating hearing loss, disability ratings are derived by a mechanical application of the ratings schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are rendered. See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992). Hearing loss disability evaluations range from noncompensable (zero percent) to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity. Audiological examinations used to measure impairment must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include both a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a puretone audiometric test. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(a).

The ratings schedule provides a table for ratings purposes (Table VI) to determine a Roman numeral designation (I for essentially normal acuity through XI for profound deafness) for hearing impairment, based upon a combination of the percent of speech discrimination and the puretone threshold average, which is the sum of the puretone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 hertz, divided by four. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100.

Table VII is then used to determine the percentage evaluation by intersecting the Roman numeral designations from Table VI for hearing impairment of each ear. The horizontal row represents the ear having the poorer hearing and the vertical column represents the ear having the better hearing. Id. 

If impaired hearing is service-connected in only one ear, in order to determine the percentage evaluation from Table VII, the non-service-connected ear will be assigned a Roman Numeral designation for hearing impairment of I. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(f).

Turning to the relevant medical evidence of record, the Veteran underwent a VA audiology examination in October 2023. Upon audiometric testing, the Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Average

LEFT	 25	55	60	65	 51

The speech discrimination score (Maryland CNC Word List) was 84 percent for the left ear.

Applying the October 2023 audiology examination findings to Table VI, the result is a Roman Number II designation for the left ear. As the right ear is not service connected, a Roman Number I designation is assigned for that ear. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(f). Thus, the Board finds that a compensable rating for the Veteran's left ear hearing loss is not warranted at any time during the appellate period.

Furthermore, in addition to dictating objective test results, a VA audiologist must fully describe the functional effects caused by a hearing disability in the final report. See Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007). In this case, the October 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran's left ear hearing condition did not have any functional impact on the ordinary conditions of daily life, including ability to work and the Veteran denied difficulties with his hearing. A comparison between the level of severity and symptomatology of the Veteran's left ear hearing loss with the established criteria found in the rating schedule shows that the rating criteria reasonably describe the Veteran's disability level and symptomatology. Thus, the overall evidence, fails to support the assignment of a compensable rating.

Accordingly, the Board finds that entitlement to a compensable rating for left ear hearing loss is not warranted. The evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable disability rating for left ear hearing loss. The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

4. A rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee condition

The Veteran asserts that his left knee condition warrants a higher rating.

The Veteran was assigned a noncompensable evaluation under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261 for limitation of extension and a 10 percent evaluation under DC 5260 for limitation of flexion. The evidentiary record does not reasonably raise the prospect that the Veteran's disability is not and cannot be adequately rated under the Rating Schedule.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion (ROM) testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a [or 4.73] criteria.").

However, the regulations also caution that the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various DCs is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994). Separate ratings can be assigned for knee disabilities when none of the symptomatology overlaps and the separate rating is based on additional disabling symptomatology; this includes separate ratings based on limitation of flexion (DC 5260), limitation of extension (DC 5261), instability and recurrent subluxation (DC 5257), and meniscal conditions (DC 5258, 5259). See VAOPGCPREC 23-97, 62 Fed. Reg. 63,603 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 9-98, 63 Fed. Reg. 56,703 (1998); VAOPGCPREC 9-2004; 69 Fed. Reg. 59,988 (2004); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017).

The normal ROM of the knee is from 0 degrees extension to 140 degrees flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II. Limitation of flexion warrants 10, 20, and 30 percent ratings when limitation is to 45 degrees, 30 degrees, and 15 degrees, respectively. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260. Limitation of extension warrants 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 percent ratings when limitation is to 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees, respectively. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261. A 10 percent rating can also be assigned for the knee joint if there is painful motion without compensable limitation of motion. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5003; see also Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011) (holding that the applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to arthritis claims).

Ratings can be assigned when a knee disability affects the meniscus, with a 20 percent rating for dislocated semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint and a 10 percent rating for removal of semilunar cartilage (e.g., meniscectomy) and current residual symptoms. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5258, 5259.

Ratings can be assigned for impairment of the tibia or fibula, genu recurvatum, or ankylosis of the knee. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5256, 5262, 5263. Ankylosis is stiffening or fixation of a joint as the result of a disease process, with fibrous or bony union across the joint. Dinsay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 79, 81 (1996). Ankylosis is also defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure." DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 93 (30th ed. 2003). In this case the evidence does not reflect, and the Veteran does not allege, that he has tibia or fibula impairment, genu recurvatum, or ankylosis of the knee. As such, those DCs are not for application.

Ratings can be assigned for knee instability or subluxation under DC 5257. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. 

Regarding recurrent subluxation and instability, a compensable rating requires persistent instability. Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. "Persistent" is defined as "continuing or inclined to persist in a course" with "continuing" defined as "constant" and "persist" defined as "to continue to exist." Merriam-Webster's Dictionary (merriam-webster.com/dictionary, accessed February 8, 2021). Under these criteria, a 30 percent rating is assigned with unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear which causes persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation. A 20 percent rating is assigned with either (a) Sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device for ambulation, or (b) Unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device or bracing for ambulation. A 10 percent rating is assigned for sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device or bracing for ambulation.

Regarding patellar instability, a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker warrants a 30 percent rating, which is the highest allowable rating for patellar instability. A diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker warrants a 20 percent rating. A diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker warrants a 10 percent rating. The patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257, Note (1). A surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration). Id., Note (2). In this instance, the Veteran did not undergo a surgical repair of a patellofemoral component.

The Veteran underwent a left knee VA examination in November 2023. He was diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome. The Veteran reported pain upon weight-bearing and that he was unable to run, stand, or walk for a long period of time.

The November 2023 VA examiner did not find instability, subluxation, or effusion. The Veteran's ROM, although not normal, did not contribute to a functional loss. Active ROM measurements were flexion and extension endpoint of 135 degrees and 0 degrees respectively. There was evidence of pain in weight-bearing, active motion, and passive motion, but it did not result in or cause functional loss.

There was no evidence of crepitus or objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue. There was no additional functional loss of function or ROM after three repetitions. After repeated use over time, there was pain that caused functional loss and estimated ROM was flexion endpoint at 135 degrees and extension endpoint at 5 degrees. The Veteran reported no flare-ups and the examiner found no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, recurrent subluxation, persistent instability, or a meniscal condition. The Veteran reported no surgeries for the left knee or the use of assistive devices. Left knee X-rays were negative. The examiner did not find that the Veteran's left knee condition impacted his ability to perform occupational tasks.

The Board finds that the evidence of record does not warrant a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's left knee condition.

As discussed above, ROM testing was performed and the Veteran, at worst, has an estimated 135 degrees of left knee flexion and 5 degrees left knee extension after repeated use over time. The Veteran was asked about pain, flare-ups, and functional limitations, and relevant testing was performed, to include testing for pain and testing to reveal any additional functional limitations in certain circumstances, such as after repetitive use. When given the opportunity to describe functional limitation related to the disability, the Veteran's lay statements do not show the requisite limitation of motion necessary for a higher or separate rating. Thus, the November 2023 VA examiner's findings reflect the Veteran's estimated ROM.

Pain was noted during ROM testing, but functional loss due to pain is rated at the same level where functional loss is impeded. Stated another way, ROM may be possible beyond the point when pain sets in, but for rating the disability, only to the extent pain limits motion is considered. Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 43 (2011). As clinical examination revealed pain on motion, the rating in fact compensates the Veteran for his functional loss due to his left knee pain. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59; see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 33, 43 (2011). Given the above, even when considering the knee pain's impact on physical activities, a higher or separate compensable rating is not warranted based on limitation of motion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260, 5261.

Additionally, a rating under DC 5003 is also not warranted. The X-ray findings in the November 2023 VA examination report were negative and there has been no medical or lay evidence of incapacitating episodes. 

Under DC 5257, a rating for recurrent subluxation or instability is also not warranted because the evidence is against a finding of persistent instability. The November 2023 VA examination report did not reveal any instability, which is strong evidence against a finding of persistent instability. The evidence also does not show that the Veteran has recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. 

A separate rating under DC 5258 is also not warranted because it requires dislocated semilunar cartilage and the November 2023 VA examination report does not reflect that the Veteran has a semilunar impairment. Thus, a higher or separate rating under DC 5258 is denied.

Based on the evidence above, the claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for a left knee disability is denied. The evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim and benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
