Entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy, left upper extremity, upper radicular nerve (LUE radiculopathy) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 1991 to November 1991, with additional service in the Navy Reserves until February 1999.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an April 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

The Veteran timely submitted his VA Form 10182 in April 2024, and now appeals the April 2024 rating decision.  In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  See April 2024 VA Form 10182.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the neck, entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the back, and entitlement to service connection for LUE radiculopathy, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Finally, the Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), in which the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2).  However, given that this decision solely consists of remanding the Veteran's claims on appeal, the Veteran is not prejudiced by the Board issuing this decision without delay.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).

1. Entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine (neck) is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine (back) is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy, left upper extremity, upper radicular nerve (LUE radiculopathy) is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that he injured his neck and back in 1991 after passing out while on active duty during bootcamp graduation.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-4138; see also April 2024 VA Form 10182.  He also contends that he injured his neck wearing heavy gear and while lifting and moving heavy equipment and patients during service.  Id.

Here, the claims must be remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. 

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), remands are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  In the present appeal, a pre-decisional duty to assist error has occurred because no adequate medical opinion has been obtained.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In the context of Reserve service, active military service is defined to include any period of ACDUTRA in which the individual was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, and any period of INACDUTRA during which the individual was disabled by an injury that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty.  38 U.S.C. § 101(24).

Moreover, certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, are presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Regarding a claim based solely on a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA, however, there must be some evidence that the condition was incurred or aggravated during the relevant period of service.  Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 45 (2010).

Lay statements may support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence or symptoms of a disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1153 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  However, in the present appeal, the Board notes that the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was hospital corpsman.  See DD-214.  The Veteran also worked as a paramedic following service.  See Private Treatment Records.  Given that the Veteran has medical training, he is competent to address some medical questions.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.  However, the extent of the Veteran's medical training is unclear. 

In the present appeal, no VA examiner or treating physician has opined that the Veteran's neck and back pain during and immediately following active service were due to degenerative arthritis.  That said, due to his medical training, the Veteran is competent to report that his pain was a manifestation of degenerative arthritis.  However, nothing in the record indicates that the Veteran's degenerative arthritis manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of the Veteran's separation from service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.  

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran service treatment records (STRs) contain no complaints or treatments for neck or back injuries.  Likewise, his STRs from his time in the Reserves do not show neck or back pain.  See STRs.

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted lay statements regarding each of the disabilities on appeal, explaining that his symptoms began following a syncope episode during bootcamp graduation that resulted in him falling backwards onto concrete.  The Veteran stated that he was treated by a medic but was not sent to sick call during that episode.  He also contended that his disabilities were due to wearing heavy gear, lifting, and moving heavy equipment, and lifting and moving patients in service.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-4138 (lumbar spine, cervical spine, and LUE radiculopathy).

The Veteran's diagnosis of degenerative arthritis of the neck and back was confirmed in a diagnostic record dated November 2023.  See January 2024 Treatment Record.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination regarding his thoracolumbar spine in February 2024, wherein he was again diagnosed with degenerative arthritis.  He reported that his disability onset in 1991 when he passed out during active duty.  He stated his symptoms of upper back pain began following that incident, and that he continued to have pain in the years since the incident.  See February 2024 VA Examination (Thoracolumbar Spine).

The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination regarding peripheral nerves conditions in February 2024, during which he was diagnosed with upper extremity radiculopathy.  He again reported that his radiculopathy onset in 1991 and that his symptoms have increased in severity since their onset.  See February 2024 VA Examination (Peripheral Nerves).

Additionally, the Veteran was afforded a neck (cervical spine) VA examination in February 2024.  The Veteran's diagnosis of degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine was confirmed.  He reported that this disability began in 1991 after a fall during active duty.  He also reported that his symptoms worsened over the years.  See February 2024 VA Examination (Cervical Spine).

Following those examinations, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's back pain, neck pain, and LUE radiculopathy were less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury.  As rationale, they stated that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) were silent for LUE radiculopathy, back pain, or neck pain.  See March 2024 VA Medical Opinion.  

Where VA obtains an opinion, it must be adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (holding that as part of the duty to assist claimants, VA must provide a medical examination or obtain a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to decide the claim). 

Here, a pre-decisional duty to assist error has occurred because no adequate medical opinion has been obtained regarding any of the disabilities on appeal.  Stated differently, no adequate medical opinions exist in the record.

For a medical opinion to be adequate, it must be: (1) based upon sufficient facts or data; (2) the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) the result of principles and methods reliably applied to the facts.  See Nieves-Rodriquez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008) (holding that a medical opinion must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two). 

Specifically, in the March 2024 VA medical opinion, the VA examiner relied on the absence of contemporaneous evidence as rationale for their opinion.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336, n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (stating that an examiner's opinion failed to consider whether lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of the Veteran's disability such that his claim could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence); see also Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011) (stating that "[w]hen assessing a claim, the Board may not consider the absence of evidence as substantive negative evidence.").  That is, the VA examiner's sole rationale for their medical opinion was that the Veteran's STRs were silent for LUE radiculopathy, back pain, or neck pain.  They also did not address the Veteran's report of his injury due to passing out in service and his report that his pain began following that injury.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007) (finding that an examiner impermissibly ignored the appellant's lay assertions that he had sustained a back injury in service).

While the Veteran stated that his symptoms began after passing out on active duty or, alternatively, were due to his MOS duties and he has medical training and knowledge, he provided no adequate nexus opinion.  See Nieves-Rodriquez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. at 302.

Accordingly, the issues of entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine, degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine, and LUE radiculopathy are remanded to correct the foregoing duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an adequate opinion from a VA medical professional with appropriate expertise to determine the onset and etiology of the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine, degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine, and left upper extremity radiculopathy. The entire claims file-including this BVA Remand Decision-must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner.  If the VA examiner determines that an additional examination of the Veteran is necessary to provide an opinion, such examination should be scheduled; however, the Veteran should not be required to report for another examination if it is not found to be necessary.  The examiner is asked to provide an opinion addressing the following:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine, degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine, and left upper extremity radiculopathy onset during active service or is otherwise causally or etiologically related to an in-service disease, event, or injury (i.e., direct service connection)?

2. The examiner is asked to address the Veteran's lay statements regarding an in-service injury after a syncope episode in 1991.  The examiner is also asked to address the Veteran's lay statements that he injured his neck wearing heavy gear and while lifting and moving heavy equipment and patients during service.

3. In their rationale, the examiner is asked to provide: 

(a.) A clear and detailed rationale for the opinion, including a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved. 

(b.) If the examiner relies on medical treatises, the examiner should identify and discuss the treatises. 

(c.) If the examiner feels that the requested opinion cannot be rendered without resorting to speculation, the examiner must explain whether the need to speculate is caused by a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (i.e., no one could respond given medical science and the known facts) or by a deficiency in the record or the examiner (i.e., additional facts are required, or the examiner does not have the necessary knowledge or training).
