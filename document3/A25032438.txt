REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from July 2017 to July 2021.  

For the Veteran's claim for service connection for a left knee disability, the rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2023 rating decision with respect to the claims, in pertinent part, for entitlement to service connection for bilateral flatfoot and fallen arches, a right knee disability, right shoulder strain, and unspecified anxiety disorder; and entitlement to higher evaluations for hypertension, inguinal hernia, and surgical scar of the inguinal crease.  In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the initial rating decision. 

In the May 14, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) initial rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability and an acquired psychiatric disorder, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board recognizes that the Veteran, as a layperson, is not competent to distinguish between competing diagnoses, and so a claim of service connection for one is considered a claim for all.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  As such, while the Veteran's initial claims were for service connection for bilateral flatfoot and fallen arches and anxiety, the Board has expanded the claim to one for service connection for a bilateral foot disability and an acquired psychiatric disorder generally.  Id.

In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. chapter 17 for unspecified anxiety disorder, an issue that had been on appeal.  As this issue has been resolved by a full grant of benefits, the Board finds that the issue is no longer part of the current appeal.     

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Generally, service connection requires: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In determining whether service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit-of-the-doubt when the competing evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal."  That is, exact equipoise is not required to trigger the favorable benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral foot disability

The Veteran asserts that his bilateral foot disability, claimed as bilateral fallen arches and flatfoot, developed during his active duty service.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that his bilateral foot problems were caused by him wearing combat boots, running, performing drills and field work, falling down, jumping, and carrying heavy packs.  See January 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  During a November 2023 HLR Informal Conference, the Veteran indicated that he had been seen for his flatfoot and fallen arches a couple of different times during service.  

The question before the Board is whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis for a bilateral foot disability.  Based on a careful review of all the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence weighs against finding service connection for a bilateral foot disability is warranted.

According to the Veteran's April 2017 enlistment examination, the examining physician noted that the Veteran entered active duty service with moderate, asymptomatic pes cavus.  Otherwise, the clinical evaluation of the Veteran's feet was normal.  On the associated report of medical history, the Veteran denied having any foot trouble.  During service, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not document any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for any foot problems.  (Parenthetically, the STRs do document treatment for rashes that were located on his feet; however, no specific foot condition was identified.).  At a February 2021 separation examination, the Veteran had normal feet clinical evaluation results, and on his associated report of medical history, he affirmatively denied having foot trouble.  

In April 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA General Medical Separation Health Assessment.  The April 2021 VA examiner noted that there was no history of problems with the Veteran's feet.  Upon objective evaluation, the April 2021 VA examiner found that the Veteran's feet were normal.  No foot condition, including pes planus, was diagnosed.  

Regarding the Veteran's claim for a bilateral foot disability, no underlying disability has been clinically diagnosed during the appeal period or proximate thereto.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  Notably, the clinical evidence shows that the Veteran's reported symptoms of fallen arches and flatfoot were not identified.  On that basis, the Board finds that the April 2021 VA examination report provides the most persuasive evidence, as it was conducted by a medical professional and was based on objective findings.  Thus, the most persuasive evidence does not support a finding of a current diagnosis for a bilateral foot disability.  Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for a bilateral foot disability is not warranted.

The Veteran is certainly competent to report his history of bilateral foot symptoms and any treatment that he may have undergone.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  However, the Veteran has not presented any competent and credible evidence of a current diagnosis for a bilateral foot disability, and the available evidence does not support that the Veteran has any persistent symptomatology that would suggest that he has an underlying chronic disability.  Accordingly, the Veteran's assertions that he has a current diagnosis for a bilateral foot disability have little probative value.  

In summary, the evidence is neither evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's claim for service connection for a bilateral foot disability is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against service connection for a bilateral foot disability.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Accordingly, the service connection claim for a bilateral foot disability is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability

3. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability

The Veteran asserts that his bilateral knee disability developed during active duty service.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that his bilateral foot problems were caused by running, jumping, falling down, crawling, and carrying heavy packs and equipment.  See January 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  During a November 2023 HLR Informal Conference, the Veteran indicated that he had been seen for his right knee condition during service.

The question before the Board is whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis for a bilateral knee disability.  Based on a careful review of all the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence weighs against finding service connection for a bilateral knee disability is warranted.

The Veteran's STRs document that he entered active duty service with normal lower extremities clinical evaluation results.  See April 2017 enlistment examination.  During service, the Veteran's STRs do not document any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for any knee problems.  At a February 2021 separation examination, the Veteran had normal lower extremities clinical evaluation results, and on his associated report of medical history, he affirmatively denied having any knee trouble, swollen or painful joints, or bone, joint, or other deformity.  

At an April 2021 VA General Medical Separation Health Assessment, the VA examiner noted that there was no history of problems with the Veteran's lower extremities.  Upon objective evaluation, the April 2021 VA examiner found that the Veteran's lower extremities were normal.  No knee condition was diagnosed.  

Regarding the Veteran's claim for a bilateral knee disability, no underlying disability has been clinically diagnosed during the appeal period or proximate thereto.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  Notably, the clinical evidence shows that the Veteran has not identified any current bilateral knee problems.  On that basis, the Board finds that the April 2021 VA examination report provides the most persuasive evidence, as it was conducted by a medical professional and was based on objective findings.  Thus, the most persuasive evidence does not support a finding of a current diagnosis for bilateral knee disability.  Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for a bilateral knee disability is not warranted.

The Veteran is certainly competent to report his history of bilateral knee symptoms and any treatment that he may have undergone.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

Accordingly, the Veteran's assertions that he has a current diagnosis for a bilateral knee disability have little probative value.  

In summary, the evidence is neither evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's claim for service connection for a bilateral knee disability is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against service connection for a bilateral knee disability.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Accordingly, the service connection claim for a bilateral knee disability is denied.

Increased Evaluation

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  

The veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).  Where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-510 (2007).  

1. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation from January 4, 2023 to the present for hypertension

The Veteran asserts that his hypertension is worse than his current evaluation reflects.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that his hypertension is causing him heart issues.  See November 2023 HLR Informal Conference.  

From January 4, 2023 to the present, the Veteran's hypertension has been currently evaluated as noncompensable, effective July 18, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

The Board notes that VA has amended the rating criteria for cardiovascular system disabilities effective from November 14, 2021.  These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after November 14, 2021.  Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied.  The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

Diagnostic Code 7101 was not changed by the November 14, 2021 amendments.  Under Diagnostic Code 7101, a minimum 10 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure (the lower number in a blood pressure reading) predominantly 100mm or more, or the systolic pressure (the higher number) is predominantly 160mm or more, or; a minimum 10 percent rating is assigned for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100mm or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 110mm or more or when systolic pressure is predominantly 200mm or more.  A 40 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominately 120mm or more.  A maximum 60 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 130mm or more.  Note 1 provides that hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.  For purposes of this section, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm. or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm.  Note 2 directs to evaluate hypertension due to aortic insufficiency or hyperthyroidism, which is usually the isolated systolic type, as part of the condition causing it rather than by a separate evaluation.  Note 3 directs to evaluate hypertension separately from hypertensive heart disease and other types of heart disease.

In every instance, as in this case, where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

In a recent U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) decision, Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021), the Court held that under Diagnostic Code 7101, the 10 percent rating criteria language, "a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control," refers to blood pressure readings taken before a veteran began medication to control hypertension, and therefore may require analyzing blood pressure readings prior to the period on appeal.

According to the Veteran's STRs, he started receiving medication to treat his hypertension in February 2021.  Prior to the Veteran taking medication to control his hypertension, STRs from April 2017 to September 2020 include blood pressure (BP) readings, which were recorded as follows: 130/69; 120/66; 132/80; 123/62; 126/76; 130/82; 112/82; 122/61 (supine); 139/67 (seated); 146/71 (standing); 124/67(supine); 137/73 (seated); 147/89 (standing); 112/72; 139/67; 120/75; 118/73; 133/60; 130/70; 124/70; 132/66; 121/54; 118/82; 121/58; 132/84; 130/81; 137/64; 119/71; 134/63; 126/73; 132/80; 135/62; 121/53; 125/85; 127/74; 125/63; 128/71; 142/82; 126/83; and 133/67.  An October 2020 STR documents that the provider noted that the Veteran had a history of elevated BP on chart review.  A further evaluation and monitoring was suggested.  At a November 2020 clinic visit, the Veteran presented for a hypertension evaluation noting that he had elevated BP within the last year.  The provider noted that the Veteran had an elevated blood pressure reading without a diagnosis of hypertension.  In December 2020, the Veteran had a three-day BP check.  The Veteran's BP was recorded on day one as follows: right arm was 128/80 and 128/82 and left arm was 130/82 and 126/78 in the morning and afternoon, respectively.  On day two, the Veteran's BP was recorded as 138/82 in the morning and 128/80 in the afternoon.  On day three, the Veteran's BP was recorded as 140/86 in the morning and 132/80 in the afternoon.  The provider found that the Veteran's BP log did demonstrate evidence of stage I hypertension consistent with previous documentation back to at least 2017 in the electronic medical record.  In February 2021, the Veteran's BP was recorded as 143/77, and he was prescribed medication.  

At an April 2021 VA General Medical Separation Health Assessment, the Veteran's BP readings were recorded as follows: 140/88; 142/84; and 138/80.  The April 2021 VA examiner found that the Veteran had a normal heart examination. 

At a January 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported having current symptoms of occasional headaches, chest tightness, and breathlessness.  The January 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's treatment plan included taking continuous medication for hypertension.  The January 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic BP elevation to predominately 100 or more.  During an objective evaluation, the Veteran's current BP readings were recorded as follows: 131/87; 119/69; and 124/55.  The January 2023 VA examiner found that there was no change in the Veteran's diagnosis of hypertension.  The January 2023 VA examiner determined that the Veteran's hypertension did not impact his ability to work.

Based on a careful review of all the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that from January 4, 2023 to the present, the most persuasive evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's hypertension does not warrant a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7101.  In other words, the Veteran's hypertension does not more closely approximate diastolic pressure predominantly 100mm or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160mm or more; nor is the Veteran an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100mm or more who requires continuous medication for control.  Based on the holding in Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021), the Board finds that the evidence shows that when the Veteran was not taking medication to control his hypertension until February 2021, his diastolic pressure never reached 100mm or more, and his highest diastolic pressure reading was recorded at 89mm in October 2018.  Moreover, after being on continuous medication for hypertension, the Veteran's diastolic BP reached no higher than 87mm diastolic, which occurred during his January 2023 VA examination.  Finally, the clinical findings at the January 2023 VA examination showed that the Veteran's systolic blood pressure reach no higher than 131mm.  Accordingly, the Board finds that from January 4, 2023 to the present, there is no legal basis upon which to award a compensable evaluation for hypertension under Diagnostic Code 7101.  Therefore, from January 4, 2023 to the present, the Veteran's hypertension remains noncompensable.

In summary, the evidence is neither evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's claim for a compensable evaluation from January 4, 2023 to the present for hypertension is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable evaluation for hypertension.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Accordingly, the compensable evaluation claim from January 4, 2023 to the present for hypertension is denied.

2. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation from January 4, 2023 to the present for inguinal hernia status post repair

The Veteran asserts that his inguinal hernia status post repair is worse than his current evaluation reflects.  Specifically, the Veteran reports that since the hernia surgery, he has had continuous nerve pain.  See November 2023 HLR Informal Conference.  

From January 4, 2023 to the present, the Veteran's inguinal hernia status post repair has been currently evaluated as noncompensable, effective July 18, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7338.  

The Board notes that VA has amended the rating criteria for digestive system disabilities effective from May 19, 2024.  These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after May 19, 2024.  Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied.  The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

Prior to May 19, 2024, Diagnostic Code 7338 states that a noncompensable rating is assigned for a small, reducible inguinal hernia or without true hernia protrusion.  A noncompensable rating is assigned for inguinal hernia that was not operated on, but remediable.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for postoperative, recurrent, readily reducible inguinal hernia and well supported by truss or belt.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for small, postoperative, recurrent inguinal hernia, or unoperated, irremediable inguinal hernia, not well supported by truss, or not readily reducible.  A maximum 60 percent rating is assigned for large, postoperative, recurrent inguinal hernia, not well supported under ordinary conditions and not readily reducible, when considered inoperable.  A Note states to add 10 percent for bilateral involvement, provided the second hernia is compensable.  This means that the more severe disabling hernia is to be evaluated, and 10 percent, only, added for the second hernia, if the latter is of compensable degree.  

Effective May 19, 2024, Diagnostic Code 7338 provides the rating criteria for hernia, including femoral, inguinal, umbilical, ventral, incisional, and other (but not including hiatal).  A noncompensable rating is assigned for asymptomatic hernia; present and repairable, or repaired.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with hernia size smaller than 3 centimeters (cm.).  A 20 percent rating is assigned for irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with both of the following present for 12 months or more: 1. Size equal to 3 cm or greater but less than 15 cm in one dimension; and 2. Pain when performing one of the following activities: (1) bending over, (2) activities of daily living (ADLs), (3) walking, and (4) climbing stairs.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with both of the following present for 12 months or more: 1. Size equal to 3 cm or greater but less than 15 cm in one dimension; and 2. Pain when performing at least two of the following activities: (1) bending over, (2) activities of daily living (ADLs), (3) walking, and (4) climbing stairs.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with both of the following present for 12 months or more: 1. Size equal to 15 cm or greater in one dimension; and 2. Pain when performing two of the following activities: (1) bending over, (2) activities of daily living (ADLs), (3) walking, and (4) climbing stairs.  A 100 percent rating is assigned for irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with both of the following present for 12 months or more: 1. Size equal to 15 cm or greater in one dimension; and 2. Pain when performing at least three of the following activities: (1) bending over, (2) activities of daily living (ADLs), (3) walking, and (4) climbing stairs.  Note (1) states with two compensable inguinal hernias, evaluate the more severely disabling hernia first, and then add 10 percent to that rating to account for the second compensable hernia.  Do not add 10 percent to that rating if the more severely disabling hernia is rated at 100 percent.  Note (2) states any one of the following activities of daily living are sufficient for evaluation: bathing, dressing, hygiene, and/or transfers.  

At a January 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported having some mild tenderness around the right groin.  He treated his symptoms with stretching and rest.  The January 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran had undergone an inguinal hernia repair on the right side in April 2020.  During an objective evaluation, the January 2023 VA examiner found no hernia detected on the right or left side.  The January 2023 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with inguinal hernia status post surgical repair.  The January 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran's inguinal hernia status post surgical repair did not impact his ability to work.  

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's assertions that he has had continuous nerve pain since his hernia surgery and had mild tenderness around his right groin.  However, based on a careful review of all the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that from January 4, 2023 to the present, the Veteran's inguinal hernia status post repair does not warrant a 10 percent evaluation under either the old or amended May 19, 2024 Diagnostic Code 7338.  In other words, the Veteran does not have a postoperative, recurrent, readily reducible inguinal hernia that is well supported by truss or belt; nor does he have an irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with hernia size smaller than 3 cm.  Rather, the clinical findings at the January 2023 VA examination show that there was no hernia detected on the right or left side.  Accordingly, the Board finds that from January 4, 2023 to the present, there is no legal basis upon which to award a compensable evaluation for inguinal hernia status post repair under either the old or amended Diagnostic Code 7338.  Therefore, from January 4, 2023 to the present, the Veteran's inguinal hernia status post repair remains noncompensable.

In summary, the evidence is neither evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's claim for a compensable evaluation from January 4, 2023 to the present for inguinal hernia status post repair is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable evaluation for inguinal hernia status post repair.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Accordingly, the compensable evaluation claim from January 4, 2023 to the present for inguinal hernia status post repair is denied.

3. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation from January 4, 2023 to the present for surgical scar of the inguinal crease

The Veteran asserts that his surgical scar of the inguinal crease is worse than his current evaluation reflects.  Specifically, the Veteran reports that his scar did not heal very well as it was indented and not flat.  See November 2023 HLR Informal Conference.  

The Veteran's surgical scar of the inguinal crease has been currently evaluated as noncompensable, effective July 18, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

The Board notes that VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018.  These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after August 13, 2018.  Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied.  The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

Diagnostic Code 7800 was not changed by the August 13, 2018, amendments.  However, Diagnostic Code 7800 pertains to scars or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck and is not applicable in this case.  

Effective August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Note (1) to Diagnostic Code 7802 provides that for the purposes of Diagnostic Codes 7801 and 7802, the six (6) zones of the body are defined as each extremity, anterior trunk, and posterior trunk.  The midaxillary line divides the anterior trunk from the posterior trunk.  Note (2) to Diagnostic Code 7802 provides that a separate evaluation may be assigned for each affected zone of the body under this diagnostic code if there are multiple scars, or a single scar, affecting multiple zones of the body.  Combine the separate evaluations under § 4.25.  Alternatively, if a higher evaluation would result from adding the areas affected from multiple zones of the body, a single evaluation may also be assigned under this diagnostic code.  Diagnostic Code 7802 was otherwise unchanged by the August 13, 2018 amendments.

Diagnostic Code 7804 was not changed by the August 13, 2018 amendments.  Under Diagnostic Code 7804, one or two scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 10 percent rating. Three or four scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 20 percent rating.  Five or more scars that are unstable or painful warrants a 30 percent rating.  An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118., Diagnostic Code 7804, Note 1.  If one or more scars are both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.  Id. at Note 2.  Scars evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under this diagnostic code, when applicable.  Id. at Note 3.

Diagnostic Code 7805 was not changed by the August 13, 2018 amendments.  Diagnostic Code 7805 instructs that any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 are to be evaluated under an appropriate diagnostic code.

At a January 2023 VA examination, the VA examiner found that the Veteran had a well healed and maintained scar.  During an objective evaluation, the January 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran had one scar located on the right side of his groin and measured 2.5 by 0.2 cm.  The January 2023 VA examiner found that the scar had no underlying tissue damage and had an approximate total area of 0.5 sq. cm.  The Veteran had no painful or unstable scars, with frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  The scar did not result in limitation of function.  The January 2023 VA examiner found that there was no change in the Veteran's diagnosis for surgical scar of the inguinal crease.  The January 2023 VA examiner determined that the Veteran's surgical scar of the inguinal crease did not impact his ability to work.  

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's assertions that his surgical scar was not well healed as it was indented and flat.  However, based on a careful review of all the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that from January 4, 2023 to the present, the Veteran's surgical scar of the inguinal crease does not warrant a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802.  In other words, the Veteran's surgical scar of the inguinal crease did not cover an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  Rather, the clinical findings at the January 2023 VA examination show that the Veteran's surgical scar of the inguinal crease had an approximate total area of only 0.5 sq. cm.  The Board also considered whether there were other applicable diagnostic codes to provide a compensable evaluation.  However, the Veteran's surgical scar of the inguinal crease was not painful or unstable; thus Diagnostic Code 7804 is inapplicable here.  There were also no disabling effects not already contemplated by the other diagnostic codes for scars.  Therefore, the Board finds that from January 4, 2023 to the present, there is no basis upon which to award a compensable evaluation for surgical scar of the inguinal crease under Diagnostic Codes 7802 or 7804.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that from January 4, 2023 to the present, the Veteran's surgical scar of the inguinal crease remains noncompensable.

In summary, the evidence is neither evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's claim for a compensable evaluation from January 4, 2023 to the present for surgical scar of the inguinal crease is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable evaluation for surgical scar of the inguinal crease.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Accordingly, the compensable evaluation claim from January 4, 2023 to the present for surgical scar of the inguinal crease is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the May 2023 decision on appeal.  The Veteran asserts that his current right shoulder disability was caused by a gun kickback to the right shoulder, carrying heavy machinery, packs, and equipment, falling down, physical training, performing drills, jumping, and crawling.  See January 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  At a January 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral shoulder strain.  The January 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right shoulder strain was less likely than not incurred in or caused by active duty service.  In providing a rationale, the January 2023 VA examiner found that after reviewing the Veteran's medical records, there were no medical records showing a diagnosis or treatment for right shoulder strain during service.  Thus, a nexus could not be established.  The duty to assist requires an examiner to address the veteran's lay statements to provide the Board with an adequate medical opinion because medical opinions can inform credibility findings.  Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249 (2020).  Because the January 2023 VA examiner did not explain why it did not discuss the Veteran's lay statements, the Board cannot rely on the opinion to decide the claim.  See Barr. v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  Accordingly, a remand is required to obtain a supplemental VA opinion for the Veteran's right shoulder disability and to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Board emphasizes that it is not determining whether or not the Veteran's statements that his right shoulder problems were caused by his active duty service are credible at this time, as the additional development set forth in the directives below could impact that determination.  Although the Board is requesting a medical opinion regarding his lay contentions, this is for thoroughness and not based on a finding that these contentions are credible.

2. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include unspecified anxiety disorder, is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the May 2023 decision on appeal.  At a February 2023 VA examination, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with unspecified anxiety disorder.  In providing an unfavorable nexus opinion, the February 2023 VA examiner relied, in part, on the finding that there was no record of the Veteran's stress during service and no record of a formal stress related diagnosis.  However, an April 2020 STR reflects that the Veteran reported using breathing exercises and meditation to cope with anxiety and stress.  Thus, the Board finds that the February 2023 VA opinion is based on an inaccurate factual premise.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has little, if any, probative value).  Accordingly, a remand is required to obtain a supplemental VA opinion and to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  

The Board emphasizes that it is not determining whether or not the Veteran's statements that his psychiatric disorder was caused by his active duty service are credible at this time, as the additional development set forth in the directives below could impact that determination.  Although the Board is requesting a medical opinion regarding his lay contentions, this is for thoroughness and not based on a finding that these contentions are credible.

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Arrange for an addendum opinion from an appropriately qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right shoulder disability.  The examiner should respond to the following: 

Opine whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed right shoulder disability had its onset during active duty service or was otherwise etiologically related to service. 

In providing an opinion, the examiner should consider the Veteran's complete and relevant medical history.  

The examiner must address the Veteran's lay reports describing the onset and continuity of his right shoulder symptoms.  The Veteran asserts that his current right shoulder disability was caused by a gun kickback to the right shoulder, carrying heavy machinery, packs, and equipment, falling down, physical training, performing drills, jumping, and crawling.  See January 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  

The examiner must address all of the Veteran's right shoulder diagnoses which were provided during the pendency of the appeal, to include right shoulder strain, even if any current right shoulder disability has resolved.  

The examiner must not rely solely on the lack of medical documentation as the basis for a negative opinion.  

A complete rationale with discussion of medical literature for any opinion expressed must be provided.  If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, discuss why this is the case.

2. Arrange for an addendum from an appropriately qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder.  The examiner should respond to the following:

Opine whether the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder had its onset during active duty service or was otherwise etiologically related to service.  

In providing the above opinion, the examiner should consider the Veteran's complete and relevant medical history.  

The examiner must address the Veteran's lay reports describing the onset and continuity of his psychiatric symptoms, including reports made during an April 2020 clinic visit during service that he used breathing exercises and meditation to cope with anxiety and stress.  

The examiner must address all of the Veteran's psychiatric diagnoses which were provided during the pendency of the appeal, to include unspecified anxiety disorder, even if any current psychiatric disorder has resolved.
