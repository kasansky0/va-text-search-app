ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include specified trauma related disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and major depressive disorder, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the Veteran has an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include specified trauma related disorder and PTSD, that is at least as likely as not related to his military service, and a major depressive disorder that was at least as likely as not caused by his service-connected ampullary adenocarcinoma.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include specified trauma related disorder, PTSD, and a major depressive disorder, have been satisfied.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f), 3.310, 4.125(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1986 to February 1990, and from February 1991 to March 1991. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that denied service connection for a "specified trauma related disorder."  Given the nature of the claim and the various diagnoses reflected within the medical record, the Board has broadened and recharacterized the claims as one for any acquired psychiatric disorder.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

In June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge on December 5, 2024.  A transcript of the hearing is of record.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

SERVICE CONNECTION - ACQUIRED PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER

Service connection generally will be awarded when a veteran has a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a link ("nexus") between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) require that a diagnosis of a mental disorder conform to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).

Service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the condition; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed inservice stressor occurred; and, (3) a link established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance-which includes but is not limited to equipoise-the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an 

?

approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply.  Id. at 781-82.

At the outset, the Board notes that the record contains conflicting information regarding the Veteran's actual psychiatric diagnosis, with VA treatment records noting a diagnosis of a specified trauma related disorder and a private opinion noting diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder.  In the Veteran's December 2019 claim, however, he requested service connection simply for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  

Regardless of which diagnosis applies to the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is warranted.

The Veteran has asserted that his psychiatric symptoms began in-service following the death of his brother and subsequent treatment by his superiors.  See, e.g., May 2021 Correspondence and December 2024 Hearing Testimony.  The RO denied the claim in the decision on appeal based on an absence of complaints or treatment in the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs), as well as an absence of continuity of symptoms from service to the present.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's STRs, as well as his personnel records, do not actually reflect any in-service evidence of psychiatric treatment or concerns.  However, the Board notes that the Veteran's VA treatment records do note a history of anxiety dating prior to his earliest VA records, with Lexapro having been prescribed by an outside provider.  As noted above, more recent VA treatment records at the time of the decision on appeal contain a March 2021 psychology consultation where the Veteran was diagnosed with a specified trauma-related disorder.  During this consultation, the Veteran reported a history of nightmares, physically acting out during sleep, and difficulty with anger that he attributed to his brother's death stateside that occurred while the Veteran was deployed overseas and how he was treated afterward by his Marine Corps superiors when he requested assistance.

The Board finds that the Veteran's statements as to the treatment by his superiors during service, as well as to the in-service onset and continuity of his psychiatric symptoms since service, to be both competent and credible.  However, no VA examination was provided to the Veteran prior to the decision on appeal since, as noted above, the Veteran's service treatment and personnel records are absent any evidence in-service psychiatric concerns.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i); see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006).

However, within the 90-day evidentiary window following his hearing before the undersigned, the Veteran submitted a mental health assessment by a private psychologist, Dr. D.N.  Following interview and examination of the Veteran, Dr. D.N. diagnosed the Veteran with both PTSD and major depressive disorder "based on DSM-5 criteria," and opined that it was more likely than not that his PTSD is "related to his brother's death while the Veteran was deployed and the insensitive way his platoon sergeant handled his direct request for emotional assistance from the military.  As to the major depressive disorder, Dr. D.N. opined that it was more likely than not that this diagnosis was secondary to ampullary cancer treatment.  The Board notes that the Veteran is now service-connected for ampullary adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the liver.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.   The remaining reviewable evidence is absent any medical opinion or clear evidence in significant conflict with Dr. D.N.'s determinations.  

As such, based on Dr. D.N.'s opinion, as well as the Veteran's competent and credible statements regarding the onset of his symptoms, the Board will resolve all doubt in his favor.  Therefore, service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including specified trauma related disorder and PTSD, is granted on a direct basis.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f), 4.125(a).  Further, service connection for a major depressive disorder as secondary

to service-connected ampullary adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the liver is granted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.310.  

The Board thanks the Veteran for his service.
