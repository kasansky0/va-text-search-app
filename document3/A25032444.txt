ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for neck condition is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for migraine/headaches is denied. 

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral dry eye syndrome is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for flatfoot bilateral is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The March 28, 2024, VA Form 10182 seeking service connection for a bilateral eye disability was an impermissible concurrent election and was docketed at the Board in error.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that a headache disability began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

3. The Veteran has had no visual impairment attributable to his service-connected dry eyes, and no disorder of the lacrimal apparatus.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Under the AMA, the Board is not permitted to adjudicate the same issue under two appeal streams; the issue of entitlement to service connection for a neck disability has already been adjudicated in a separate stream and therefore must be dismissed as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 19.52, 20.104.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a migraine/headache disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for dry eye syndrome have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.79, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 6099-6025.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 2001 to April 2005.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from March 2023, May 2023, August 2023, and February 2024 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In March 2024 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement, requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge. Therefore, the Board will consider only the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that VA treatment records and an April 2024 VA examination were added to the claims file after the evidentiary window closed. Therefore, the Board may not consider them in the adjudication of this matter. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304. Service connection may also be granted for a disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The standard of proof to be applied in decisions on claims for VA benefits is set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). Under that provision, VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. Id.; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). "It is in recognition of our debt to our veterans that society has [determined that,] [b]y tradition and by statute, the benefit of the doubt belongs to the veteran." Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries in civil occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations should be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss every piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or on his behalf. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claims and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claims. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).

When determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign, the Board's primary consideration is the Veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact the Veteran's occupational and social impairment. See Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The use of the term "such as" in the rating criteria demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). Nevertheless, as all ratings in the general rating formula are also associated with objectively observable symptomatology and the plain language of the regulation makes it clear that the Veteran's impairment must be "due to" those symptoms, a veteran may only qualify for a given disability by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration. See Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 118.

4. Service connection for neck condition 

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for a neck condition must be dismissed because it results from a prohibited concurrent election under the modernized review system.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The AMA automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

In February 2024 the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application as to the February 2024 rating decision. Then in March 2024 the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement also seeking review of the February 2024 rating decision.

When a claim is denied under the AMA, a claimant may either elect to submit a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or submit an appeal to the Board. A claimant cannot elect multiple review options simultaneously for the same claim. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501. Such concurrent election is specifically prohibited by 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), which states, "[A] claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option."

Here, the appeal stemming from the March 2024 VA Form 10182, with respect to entitlement to service connection for a neck condition was erroneously docketed by the Board. The February 2024 VA Form 20-0995 was pending and had not been resolved before the March 2024 VA Form 10182 was received. As the present appeal for the service connection claim for a neck condition is a concurrent election prohibited under controlling law and regulation, the appeal as to this claim must be dismissed.

5. Service connection for migraine/headaches 

The Veteran seeks service connection for migraine/headaches. 

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) include a February 2002 record noting the Veteran complained of recurrent headaches after not drinking water regularly. Notably in the August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) the Veteran asserted that his headache condition began after falling from a catwalk while aboard the USS George Washington. A February 2005 STR notes the Veteran complained of a shoulder injury after falling on a flight deck. However, the record is silent for complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a head injury or headache condition.

The Veteran's post service treatment records are silent for complaint, treatment, or diagnosis of a headache or migraine condition. 

The Board notes the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for a headache condition.

Although the Veteran has a notation of headaches during servicer, there is no evidence that he developed a chronic headache condition during service. Rather, the in-service notation for a headache is in relation to dehydration. There are no complaints of migraines, stand-alone complaints of headaches, or notations regarding headaches in conjunction with other illnesses. Further, the Veteran asserted his headache condition began after falling while aboard a ship. However, the STR related to injuries from falling only note complaint of a shoulder injury.

An incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury during service is the second required element of service connection. See Shedden, supra, 381 F.3d at 1163. Moreover, evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies is the second required element for VA to afford an appellant an examination. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (Vet. App. 2006). In this case, the single notation of a headache during an episode of being treated for dehydration does not, by itself, establish an in-service incurrence of a chronic headache disability. When coupled with the lack of complaint of headaches after the Veteran's reported in-service injury, and in the post service VA treatment records, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the second element of service connection is satisfied.

Further, there is no evidence of record to support the appellant's contention that the single instance of a headache in service is related to a current headache disability.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so regarding whether service connection for a headache disability is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the appellant's headaches are related to service. The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

6. Increased rating for bilateral dry eye syndrome 

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for his bilateral dry eye condition. 

The Veteran's dry eye syndrome is currently evaluated at 0 percent under diagnostic code 6099-6025. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the specific basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown as a hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Here, the Veteran's bilateral dry eye syndrome is currently rated as analogous to a disease of the eye (Diagnostic Code 6099) under the criteria for disorders of the lacrimal apparatus (Diagnostic Code 6025). 38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

The criteria under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate based on either visual impairment due to the particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79. Where documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition in the past 12 months, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted. Where documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 3 but less than 5 treatment visits for an eye condition in the past 12 months, during the past 12 months, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted. Where documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 5 but less than 7 treatment visits for an eye condition in the past 12 months, during the past 12 months, a 40 percent disability rating is warranted. Where documented incapacitating episodes requiring 7 or more treatment visits for an eye condition in the past 12 months, during the past 12 months, a 60 percent disability rating is warranted.

Note (1) provides that, for the purposes of evaluation under 38 CFR 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes.

Note (2) provides that examples of treatment may include but are not limited to: Systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions.

Under Diagnostic Code 6025, a 10 percent rating is warranted for unilateral involvement and a 20 percent rating is warranted for bilateral involvement of a lacrimal apparatus.

The evaluation of visual impairment is based on impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function. 38 C.F.R. § 4.75(a). Examinations of visual impairment must be conducted by a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist, and the examiner must identify the disease, injury, or other pathologic process for any visual impairment found. 38 C.F.R. § 4.75(b). Evaluation of visual acuity is based on corrected distance vision with central fixation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.76(b)(1). The measurements for each eye are applied to the table for Impairment of Central Visual Acuity.

Visual impairment may also be rated based on impairment of visual field (Diagnostic Code 6080) and impairment of muscle function (Diagnostic Code 6090). Additional ratings may also be warranted for incapacitating episodes.

Here, an April 2023 VA eye conditions DBQ noted the Veteran reported he experienced dryness and irritation in both eyes. The Veteran's corrected vision was noted as greater than 20/20 or better in each eye with no visual field contraction or loss detected in either eye. The examination showed no lacrimal apparatus disorder and no decrease in visual acuity or other visual impairment. The examiner noted there were no incapacitating episodes due to any eye disability and none of the Veteran's eye conditions impacted his ability to work.

After careful review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable rating for bilateral dry eye syndrome is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 6099-6025. Although the Veteran's disability involves the lacrimal apparatus and is rated analogously under Diagnostic Code 6025, the evidence does not show a disorder of the lacrimal apparatus, such as epiphora and dacryocystitis, which would allow for a higher rating under Diagnostic Code 6025. Moreover, the Veteran's disability has not resulted in decreased visual acuity or other visual impairment, has not caused incapacitating episodes, and has not impacted his ability to work.

In conclusion, on balance, the evidence weighs persistently against the Veteran on this issue, and thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for flatfoot bilateral 

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral flat foot. 

The Veteran's May 2001 entrance report of medical examination included an annotation of asymptomatic mild pes planus in both feet.

As the Veteran's asymptomatic bilateral asymptomatic pes planus was noted on examination when the Veteran was accepted and enrolled into active service, and he contends aggravation in service, the Board must determine whether the presumption of aggravation is applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304(b), 3.306.

Unfortunately, the Board finds a duty to assist error, as the record was not properly developed. There is no competent medical evidence on the etiology of the Veteran's bilateral foot conditions, or on whether any in-service aggravation of the Veteran's asymptomatic pes planus noted at entry was due to service or due to the natural progression of the disease.

Therefore, while the Board regrets the additional delay, this matter must be remanded to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's bilateral pes planus. If, after review of the claims file, the examiner determines that another VA examination is necessary, such must be scheduled, and the Veteran notified.

Thereafter, the examiner is asked to address the following:

Whether any aggravation or permanent increase in the severity of the bilateral pes planus was clearly and unmistakably (obvious or undebatable) due to the natural progress of the disease and not to an in-service injury, event, or disease?

A rationale must be provided for all opinions expressed. If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resort to speculation they should explain why.
