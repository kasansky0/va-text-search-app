The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, prior to the promulgation of a Board decision, the Veteran withdrew the appeal of service connection for a low back disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1990 to July 1997.

The case is on appeal from a June 2020 rating decision, which found new and relevant evidence was received and readjudicated the claim on the merits.

In the November 2020 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.

In March 2025, the Veteran's attorney withdrew the hearing request.

Service connection for a low back disability.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  An appeal may be withdrawn by the Veteran or representative before the Board promulgates a decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In March 2025, the Veteran's representative submitted a statement.  In doing so, the representative stated, "Please accept this letter as formal notification that the [Veteran] wishes to withdraw the following issue(s): 1. Degenerative Arthritis of the Spine with Intervertebral Disc Syndrome claimed as back condition as secondary to Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome, Right Knee."

The Board finds that the Veteran's withdrawal of the issue on appeal is "explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant."  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011); see also Acree v O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  This was an express written statement made by an attorney representative.

Therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration with regard to this docketed AMA appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
