DOCKET NO. 240603-445243
DATE: April 8, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 3, 2022, for the award of special monthly compensation based on the need for aid and attendance is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty with the U.S. Navy from September 2003 to April 2011.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the effective date assigned for special monthly compensation (SMC) awarded in a December 2022 Rating Decision.  In May 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that the Veteran did not specify a factual error to support a finding of clear and unmistakable error.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to a higher rate of SMC and an earlier effective date for the award of SMC, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

On the Veteran's August 2023 Supplemental Claim, he requested a higher rate of SMC.  The AOJ did not adjudicate the issue.  The claim was repeated in the June 2024 10182.  Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate the issue of entitlement to a higher rate of SMC.  The Veteran may resubmit the claim to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending.

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of SMC based on aid and attendance is remanded.

By way of background, the Veteran was awarded SMC due to the need for aid and attendance, effective March 3, 2022, in a December 2022 Rating Decision.  In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim seeking an earlier effective date for the award of SMC (and a higher rate of SMC.)  In the May 2024 Rating Decision on appeal, the RO found that there was not clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the effective date assigned for the award of SMC, but did not adjudicate whether an earlier effective date or higher rate of SMC was warranted on the merits.

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that a motion seeking revision on the basis of CUE is a completely separate claim from entitlement to an earlier effective.  See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006).  In addition, the Court has held that effective date and CUE issues are not inextricably intertwined, because while the effective date element flows directly from the award of service connection, a CUE motion may be brought at any time and is premised upon an error in a prior final decision.  See Phillips v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 25 (1997).

Here, the Veteran has never alleged that there was CUE in the December 2022 Rating Decision that awarded SMC based on the need for aid and attendance, effective March 3, 2022.  Instead, the RO appeal appears to have sua sponte raised the issue of whether there was CUE in the effective date assigned for the award of SMC.  This adjudication of whether there was CUE in the December 2022 Rating Decision was improper, as the Veteran did not allege CUE in his August 2023 Supplemental Claim, CUE issues are not inextricably intertwined with the effective date issue the Veteran raised in his Supplemental Claim, and the December 2022 Rating Decision was not final.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a); see also Phillips, 10 Vet. App. 25.  

For these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's August 2023 Supplemental Claim seeking an effective date prior to March 3, 2022, for the award of SMC, has not been adjudicated in the first instance by the RO, as the May 2024 Rating Decision on appeal only and improperly adjudicated the issue of whether there was CUE in the effective date assigned for the award of SMC in the non-final December 2022 Rating Decision.  See generally Young v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 51 (2019) (citing Gomez v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 39, 43 n.1 (2015) (observing that it would be "illogical" for a claimant to "forfeit the right to direct review of a [VA] decision in exchange for review under the much higher scrutiny of a CUE motion").  VA is required by both statute and regulation to adjudicate the issues claimed, and the Board may not adjudicate claims in the first instance.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3.103, 20.103, 20.104.  Therefore, remand is warranted so that the RO can correct its error in satisfying this regulatory duty to properly adjudicate the August 2023 Supplemental Claim in the first instance.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).
