ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The appellant did not timely file a VA Form 10182 and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182 for the claim seeking entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appellant's VA Form 10182 was not timely received and the criteria for an extension for the filing of a VA Form 10182 are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty from July 1997 to July 2001 and from November 2001 to August 2002.

This matter come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Regional Office (RO). 

Procedurally and in pertinent part, the March 2023 rating decision denied service connection for a prostate cancer disability. The notice indicated that should the appellant disagree with the determination, they had one year to file a notice of disagreement.

In September 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, disagreeing with that determination. That appeal is currently docketed under docket number 230918-377222. 

Then, in March 2024, the Veteran submitted an additional VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, with the March 2023 rating decision, essentially appealing the same issue twice. That notice of disagreement originated the present appeal, docketed as 240328-427204.

In a February 2025 correspondence, VA informed the Veteran that his March 2024 was untimely, and that ultimately the issue would be addressed in a separate appeal. The Veteran was given 60 days to respond, but VA has received no correspondence since the notification was sent to the Veteran.

VA regulations unequivocally provide that, except in limited circumstances (which do not apply here), a notice of disagreement (NOD, VA Form 10182) must be submitted to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within one year of the decision being appealed. A NOD must identify the specific decision and issue(s) therein with which the claimant disagrees. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue(s) therein 38 C.F.R. § 20.202, 20.203. Additionally, VA regulations provide clear recourse in circumstances when a filing extension is required at 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c), which allows for an extension to be granted "for good cause" if the request is offered in writing and submitted to the Board.

Unfortunately, the March 28, 2024, VA Form 10182 is untimely, as it was submitted more than a year after the March 22, 2023, rating decision on appeal. The appellant also did not allege good cause for an extension for the untimely VA Form 10182. Additionally, the Veteran is entitled to only one review on appeal under 38 U.S.C. § 7104. 

Regulations are "binding on all who seek to come within their sphere," regardless of whether an appellant has knowledge of such regulations. See Jernigan v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 220 (2012).

If the appellant so wishes, they may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify new and relevant evidence so that it can be considered by the AOJ and a decision issued. After the AOJ's determination, the appellant may file a VA Form 10182 within one year of the determination. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

In summary, the Board finds that the March 2024 attempted appeal of the March 2023 denial of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, is untimely. The law is dispositive in this instance and the Board is bound by the laws and regulations governing VA benefits. The Board may only grant entitlement to VA benefits authorized by law and does not have authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c). Additionally, as the Veteran's claim is being adjudicated under a different docket number, the Veteran is not prejudiced by the present dismissal.

Absent good cause having been presented, the appellant's March 2021 VA Form 10182 is considered untimely, and the attempted appeal of this issue under the AMA system for that particular Notice of Disagreement must be dismissed.
