FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On July 19, 2022 the Veteran submitted an "Intent to File" followed by a fully developed claim in March 2023; there was no earlier claim for service connection for left foot hammer toe or "Intent to File" prior to July 19, 2022.

2. On July 19, 2022 the Veteran submitted an "Intent to File" followed by a fully developed claim in March 2023; there was no earlier claim for service connection for right foot hammer toe or "Intent to File" prior to July 19, 2022.

3. The Veteran's left foot hammer toe disability is not manifested by hammer toe of all toes on the left foot.

4. The Veteran's right foot hammer toe disability is not manifested by hammer toe of all toes on the right foot.

5. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes a finding that the Veteran's anxiety condition is unrelated to his active-duty service. The evidence is not in approximate balance.

6. The Veteran's left knee arthritis was not shown as chronic in service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; and the disability is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

7. The Veteran's right knee arthritis was not shown as chronic in service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; and the disability is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1978 to July 1982. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

A brief review of the procedural history of this claim is warranted for clarity. 

In response to the Veteran's March 2023 claim, the April 2023 decision granted service connection for bilateral hammer toes and assigned a non-compensable rating. Service connection for anxiety and bilateral knee arthritis was denied.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of only entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee disabilities most recently addressed in an April 2023 rating decision. In October 2023 the AOJ issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested an additional review of the April 2023 AOJ decision's denial of entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee arthritis. In December 2023, the AOJ issued a HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 decision as this was the decision identified by the Veteran.

The Veteran filed an additional Supplemental Claim in February 2024 which again sought review of the April 2023 decision's denial of entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee arthritis. A February 2024 decision found new and relevant evidence had been received but denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a HLR request for the February 2024 decision regarding his bilateral knee arthritis and the April 2023 decision regarding service connection for his bilateral knees and anxiety. The Veteran also sought HLR of the April 2023 decision's denial to award a compensable rating for his bilateral hammer toes condition. However, the April 2023 decision denying service connection for a bilateral knee disability was already subject to a December 2023 HLR which was denied in December 2023. As the Veteran already requested a HLR of these issues, an additional HLR of the April 2023 decision is not permitted. The only decision available for HLR regarding the denial of service connection for the knees is the February 2024 supplemental claim rating decision.  

The April 2024 HLR decision stated evidence regarding all five issues was limited to the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 decision. However, the decision then stated, for his left and right knee, evidence since the February 2024 AOJ decision was considered. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee arthritis and anxiety, as well as entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral hammer toe, were all denied on the merits. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. The Veteran sought review of entitlement to a compensable rating for his bilateral hammer toes and service connection for bilateral knee arthritis and anxiety in the April 2024 Notice of Disagreement. In doing so, the Veteran identified three rating decisions for review. He first identified that initial April 2023 decision, the February 2024 supplemental claim decision regarding bilateral knee arthritis, and April 2024 HLR decision. Essentially, the Veteran is requesting review of the exact same issues that were decided in three separate decisions. 

Regarding the Veteran's bilateral knees, the Board will accept the April 2024 AOJ decision as the decision on appeal. The March 2024 HLR requested review of the February 2024 supplemental claim decision that denied service connection for bilateral knee arthritis. The Board acknowledges the April 2024 notice of disagreement is timely to all the AOJ decisions identified by the Veteran therein. However, in accepting the April 2024 decision as the one on appeal, the evidentiary window for the knees is expanded through the issuance of the February 2024 supplemental claim decision notice. This provides the largest timeframe for which evidence related to the knees may be reviewed. Thus, for evidence regarding the Veteran's bilateral knee arthritis, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Regarding the Veteran's claim for an initial compensable rating for bilateral hammer toes and service connection for anxiety, no supplemental claims were submitted. Rather, the Veteran submitted a HLR in March 2024 seeking review of the initial April 2023 decision. The April 2024 decision considered the evidence of record as the time of the April 2023 decision in denying a compensable rating for his hammer toes and service connection for anxiety. Regardless of which decision is on appeal before the Board for these three issues, the April 2023 or April 2024 decision, the evidentiary window for consideration remains the same. The Board accepts the April 2024 AOJ decision that denied an initial compensable rating for bilateral hammer toes and service connection for anxiety as the decision on appeal currently before the Board. Thus, for evidence regarding the Veteran's hammer toes and anxiety, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran also attempted to appeal the effective date for all issues in the April 2024 notice of disagreement. The Veteran's bilateral hammer toes are currently the only disability on appeal for which an effective date has been assigned. Therefore, the Board can only address the issue of entitlement ot an earlier effective date of service connection for bilateral hammer toes.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran have not raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist. See Scott v McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board...to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to duty to assist argument).

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 19, 2022 for the award of service connection for left foot hammer toe.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 19, 2022 for the award of service connection for right foot hammer toe.

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to July 19, 2022 for the award of service connection for his bilateral hammer toes condition. The Veteran has not identified an alternative date for consideration or provided any argument as to why an earlier effective date is warranted. 

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.157. The amended regulations apply to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015, as is the case here, but require the actual filing of the correct form designated by the Secretary of VA.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be on the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.400(b)(2). However, an effective date can be assigned on the date an Intent to File is received by VA if a claim is filed within one year of the Intent to File.

In this case, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File on July 19, 2022, followed by a March 22, 2023 fully developed claim seeking service connection for bilateral hammer toe. As his claim was received within one year of his Intent to File, his date of claim is July 19, 2022. The April 2023 decision awarded service connection and assigned a noncompensable rating effective July 19, 2022. 

The record does not show that any claim form or documentation was received from the Veteran prior to July 19, 2022 that can be interpreted as a claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hammer toes. Thus, the Board concludes that the record does not show the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for bilateral hammer toes prior to July 19, 2022.

The Veteran has not explained why he believes he is entitled to an earlier effective date. As discussed above, the statutes and regulations relevant to establishing effective dates for the grant of service connection dictate that the effective date will generally be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a), (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b). In this case, the Intent to File was received on July 19, 2022. Even if entitlement arose earlier, the date of claim would be the later of the two dates. There simply is no basis in the relevant law to grant an effective date earlier than the effective date already established. The Board is without authority to grant benefits out of equity. Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994). No equities, no matter how compelling, can create a right to payment out of the United States Treasury that has not been provided for by Congress. Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992).

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to an effective date prior to July 19, 2022 for the grant of service connection for bilateral hammer toes is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding there was any claim prior to July 19, 2022 that would warrant an earlier effective date. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application when the evidence is persuasively for or against the claim). The claim is denied.

Increased Rating

A disability rating is determined by applying VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate DCs. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

If there is a question as to which evaluation to apply to the Veteran's disability, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

To evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's disability. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). Staged ratings are appropriate when the evidence establishes that the claimed disability manifested symptoms that would warrant different ratings for distinct time periods during the course of the appeal. Id. at 126-27; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left foot hammer toe. 

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right foot hammer toe.

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for his left and right foot hammer toes. 

The Veteran's service-connected bilateral hammer toes are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5282, for hammer toe. Under DC 5282, a noncompensable rating is warranted for hammer toe of a single toe. A maximum 10 percent rating is warranted for hammer toe of all toes, unilateral, without claw foot. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5282.

The Veteran's VA treatment records show reports of foot pain. However, there are no findings of hammer toe for all five toes on either foot. 

He underwent a VA examination in April 2023 for his bilateral feet. He was diagnosed with pes planus and hammer toes in third and fourth toes of the right foot and in the great, second, third, and fourth toes of the left foot. The Veteran is already service connected for pes planus and that issue is not currently before the Board. The Veteran reported current throbbing and shooting pain in his feet. While the Veteran endorsed flare ups in his feet generally, no specific assertions were made regarding his hammer toes. The Veteran's functional loss included bilateral deformity, disturbance in locomotion, less movement than normal, pain, and lack of endurance. This prevents the Veteran from walking or standing for long distance or times. However, this examination was for the Veteran's foot and did not assert any functional loss specific to the Veteran's toes. 

In this case, the persuasive weight of the evidence weighs against finding the Veteran has hammer toes in all toes of the left or right foot. At most, his right foot has 2 hammer toes while his left has 4. Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011). In this case, the Veteran has not made any assertions regarding pain specific to his toes rather than his whole foot or any functional loss as a result of toe pain. Therefore, even considering § 4.59, entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left and right foot hammer toes under DC 5282 is not warranted. 

In finding so, the Board acknowledges the Veteran endorsed foot pain and pain under his right 5th toe. In this case, the Veteran's general foot pain and resulting functional loss is already compensated under his 20 percent rating for pes planus under DC 5276. While VA's rating schedule recognizes that a single disability may result from more than one distinct injury or disease, rating the same disability or its manifestation(s) under different DCs - a practice known as pyramiding - is prohibited. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. The critical element in permitting the assignment of several evaluations under various DCs is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disorders is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disorder. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994). In this case, the Veteran has not reported pain specific to his service-connected hammer toes on either foot. He only reported general foot pain which is already contemplated by his separately service-connected pes planus rating. Additionally, while pain was reported over his 5th right toe, this has not been identified as a hammer toe for which service connection was granted. Therefore, further consideration of the Veteran's 5th right toe is not warranted. Thus, entitlement to an initial compensable rating for pain under DC 5282 would result in the Veteran being compensated twice for the same foot pain and is not warranted.

The Board has considered the other DCs pertaining to the foot. Here, the Veteran's right and left foot hammertoes disability is specifically listed under the rating schedule, and therefore, cannot be rated under a different DC. There are no additional foot conditions or symptoms not currently service connected and contemplated. Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 336-337 (2015).

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left and right foot hammer toes is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding the Veteran has hammer toe in all toes of either foot. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claim is denied.

Service Connection

In seeking VA disability compensation, a Veteran generally seeks to establish that a current disability results from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131. "Service connection" basically means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381, F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for anxiety.

The Veteran seeks service connection for anxiety. 

The April 2024 decision made a favorable finding that the Veteran had a current anxiety disability as diagnosed in a December 2018 VA treatment record. This is a favorable finding to which the Board is bound. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). As a result, the first element of service connection has been met.

In the Veteran's March 2023 fully developed claim the Veteran grouped anxiety, a back condition, and a back surgery together without further explanation. The Veteran also stated, "I had back surgery lifting heavy equipment and being around tank they made very [loud] sound [especially] when they were shooting rounds. anxiety." He also reported being on a ship for 7 months with the navy, going to Okinawa Japan for 1 year, being in the 1st tank battalion, exposure to chemical and food contamination, setting up radio communication for tanks, and hearing loud noises from tanks. It is unclear whether the Veteran is describing circumstances of service relating to his anxiety or to his back claim. 

The Veteran has separately claimed entitlement to service connection for a back injury which was denied in a July 2023 AOJ decision. The Veteran appealed and entitlement to service connection for a back disability was denied by the Board in March 2025. Therefore, the issue of service connection for a back disability is not part of this appeal. The Veteran may still submit a supplemental claim in response or appeal the issue to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claim, if he wishes to pursue a claim for the back.

The Veteran has not clearly articulated a theory of service connection for anxiety; nevertheless, the Board will analyze whether the evidence establishes a relevant in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Veteran appears to describe exposure to loud tank fire, chemical and food contamination, onboard service on a ship for 7 months, serving in Japan for 1 year, and setting up radio communications. 

Regarding the Veteran's onboard service, his time in Japan, chemical and food contamination, and setting up radio communications, the Veteran has not reported any specific instances, experiences, or injuries from which he believes his anxiety stems. The Veteran is competent to report on the observable aspects of his service to include duty locations. He is also credible in that his assertions are consistent with the other evidence of record. However, without any additional information, these vague contentions are insufficient to establish an in-service injury, event, or disease to which anxiety may be related.

Specific to his assertions regarding chemical and food contamination, the Veteran is competent to report on the observable aspects of his service. However, he is not competent to identify food contaminations and chemical exposures as the evidence of record does not show he has the required experience or training to make such a finding. Additionally, under 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b), an examination for toxic exposure risk activity related claims is not warranted for mental disorders listed in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, to include a generalized anxiety disorder. Without any additional information, these vague contentions regarding exposures are insufficient to establish an in-service injury, event, or disease to which anxiety may be related.

Regarding anxiety due to tank noise, the Veteran is competent to report on the observable aspects of his active service, including loud noise from tanks firing. The Board finds no reason to doubt his assertions of such exposure in this instance. However, the Veteran has given no description of how his current anxiety is related to tank fire in service, and has not described any in-service mental health symptoms. To the extent that tank fire is the claimed in-service injury, the Board finds that there is no competent or credible evidence relating the Veteran's current anxiety to that noise.

On the contrary, the medical evidence of record indicates the Veteran's anxiety stems from family concerns. Specifically, the Veteran's VA treatment records beginning in June 2017 note anxiety due to a family member's medical conditions and reluctance to attend school. This stressor was continually referred to through February 2023. In March 2023 he continued to report family related stressors with the addition of employment related stress. VA mental health treatment records show no assertions that the Veteran's anxiety was related to his service. 

While the Veteran is competent to assert the observable symptoms of his anxiety, he is not medically competent to link his condition to his active service, to include reports of tank fire. An opinion of that nature requires medical expertise that is outside the realm of common knowledge of a layperson, and the Veteran does not have relevant medical training, experience, or education to provide a competent medical opinion on nexus between his current anxiety disability and loud tank fire. Kahana, 24 Vet. App. 428; Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372. Therefore, his lay statements are provided no probative weight in this matter. 

The competent and credible evidence of record weighs against finding the Veteran's anxiety is a result of any service-connected disability or tank fire in service. In making such a finding, the Board acknowledges no VA examination was provided. Consistent with the VA's duty to assist, under McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006), a VA medical examination must be provided when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4)(i). While the Veteran has a current disability and his exposure to tank fire has been conceded, the evidence of record does not provide any indication his anxiety is a result of such exposure. Rather, his VA providers consistently attribute his anxiety to current familial and employment-related stressors. 

A conclusory lay statement of causation is not sufficient to trigger the duty to assist in providing an examination. Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (rejecting appellant's argument that his "conclusory generalized statement that his service illness caused his present medical problems was enough to entitle him to a medical examination under the standard of [38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2)(B)]."). In this case, the Veteran has not provided any supporting medical evidence, or a clearly articulated theory of service connection. He has not specifically explained how his anxiety is related to noise in service, or provided a description of onset directly after his reported in-service stressor or provided any further indication, other than his own belief, that his anxiety may be related to his active-duty service. Therefore, the AOJ's decision not to provide a VA examination was not a duty to assist error. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to service connection for anxiety is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding the Veteran's anxiety is secondary to a service-connected disability or related to tank fire exposure in service. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability. 

The Veteran asserts his current bilateral knee arthritis is a result of lifting heavy equipment in service. 

Initially, the April 2024 rating decision found the Veteran had a current left and right knee diagnosis of degenerative osteoarthropathy. This is a favorable finding by the AOJ by which the Board is bound. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). As a result, the first element of service connection has been met.

In the Veteran's March 2023 claim, he listed several conditions to include knee pain. The Veteran did not make any specific assertions regarding his knee. Under all of his claimed conditions the Veteran asserted he lifted heavy radio equipment in the field during "many field exercises." He also set up radio communications. The Veteran is competent to report on the observable aspects of his service to include lifting heavy equipment. The Board finds no reason to doubt his credibility in this matter. Therefore, the second element of service connection has been met. 

The Veteran does not assert that his bilateral knee arthritis began in service with persistent symptoms since that time. The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for complaints of or treatment for bilateral knee symptoms. His May 1982 separation examination noted normal lower extremities. 

The Veteran's VA treatment records show the Veteran reported a 4-to-5-month history of knee pain in December 2012. He continued to report knee pain and issues with buckling. A November 2021 VA medicine and rehabilitation clinic evaluation record diagnosed him with degenerative osteoarthritis in both knees. The Veteran denied any major traumas, falls, or accidents across his lifetime but did endorse falling twice in the past 6 months due to his legs giving out. 

In this case, the Veteran reported a 4-to-5-month history of knee pain for the first time in December 2012. This places the onset of his knee pain approximately 30 years after his separation from service. The only lay evidence submitted by the Veteran indicated he believed his general pain was a result of lifting heavy equipment. 

While the Veteran is competent to assert the observable symptoms of his bilateral knee arthritis, he is not medically competent to link his condition to his active service, to include reports of lifting heavy equipment. An opinion of that nature requires medical expertise that is outside the realm of common knowledge of a layperson, and the Veteran does not have relevant medical training, experience, or education to provide a nexus opinion in this matter. Kahana, 24 Vet. App. 428; Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372.

The competent and credible evidence of record does not establish left or right knee arthritis during service or within one year of service. While there is no doubt the Veteran has a current knee disability, the evidence does not support finding that it was due to an injury, disease, or event in service. Thus, service connection is not warranted on a direct basis, presumptive basis, or on the basis of continuity of symptomatology.

The Board acknowledges no VA examination was obtained. However, while the Veteran has a current bilateral knee disability and asserted heavy lifting in service, there is no indication from the record these two findings may be related. Therefore, the duty to assist in obtaining a VA opinion is not triggered and remand for additional development is not warranted. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79; Waters, 601 F.3d 1274. 

Finally, in February 2024, the Veteran submitted what appears to be a word document with portions of medical articles regarding arthritis on it. Medical treatise evidence can, in some circumstances, constitute competent medical evidence, especially when combined with an opinion of a medical professional. See Sacks v. West, 11 Vet. App. 314, 317 (1998); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(1). However, as is the case here, generic information in a medical journal or treatise is normally too general and inconclusive to constitute the sole basis for establishing a medical nexus to a disease or injury. Mattern v. West, 12 Vet. App. 222, 227 (1999); see also Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 514 (1998) (treatise evidence must "not simply provide speculative generic statements not relevant to the Veteran's claim."). In this case, the submitted articles are general in nature and are not specific to this Veteran and the development of his bilateral knee disabilities. The Veteran has not provided an evaluation of these snippets of articles by a medical professional competent to relate them back to the Veteran's bilateral knee disabilities. As a result, the medical treatise evidence submitted by the Veteran is afforded no probative weight.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee arthritis is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding manifestations sufficient to identify a chronic left or right knee disability during active-duty service, or within one year thereafter, or a nexus between a current disability and his active-duty service. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claim is denied.
