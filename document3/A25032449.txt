DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to an increased rating for left ear hearing loss is dismissed.

3. Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 20 percent for cervical strain is denied.

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The April 2024 VA Form 10182 as it related to the appeal seeking service connection for sleep apnea was an impermissible concurrent election and the matter was docketed in error.

2. The April 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement was not received within one year of notification of the March 2023 rating decision and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182.

3. The Veteran's symptomatology does not manifest in forward flexion of the cervical spine of 15 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.  38?U.S.C. §§?5104C, 7105, 7108; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2400, 3.2500, 19.2, 20.201, 20.202.

2. The appeal seeking an increased rating for left ear hearing loss is dismissed as untimely.  38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 19.25, 20.203.

3. The criteria for an increased rating for cervical strain in excess of 20 percent have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5237.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1982 to August 2002.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), from November 2023 (sleep apnea), March 2023 (left ear hearing loss), and August 2023 (cervical strain and GERD) rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023, March 2023, and August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of an increased rating for GERD, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Under the AMA, if a duty to assist error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal, the appeal must be remanded to the AOJ for correction of the error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  In this case, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error was made regarding the claim for an increased rating for GERD because the RO did not develop the record by requesting private treatment records.

1. Service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

The appeal for service connection for sleep apnea must be dismissed because it results from a prohibited concurrent election under the modernized review system. The Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep apnea was in Higher-Level Review status at the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time he submitted his VA Form 10182 to VA.

As a general matter, within one year of the date the AOJ issues a decision, a claimant may elect one of three review options, or lanes: (i) Higher-Level Review by the AOJ; (ii) Supplemental Claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1).  If a request for review under one of these three lanes is pending final adjudication, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b), 20.205.

After a claimant elects one of the three available review options, the claimant may not take another action with respect to the same claim until the Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is adjudicated; or the elected request for Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is withdrawn.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

In November 2023 the AOJ issued a rating decision denying service connection for sleep apnea.  The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review in December 2024.  In April 2024, before the higher-level review was conducted, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  At the time the Veteran submitted the VA Form 10182, the AOJ had not taken action on the Higher-Level Review request and the claim remained pending and unadjudicated.

As explained above, when a claim is denied under the AMA, a claimant may either elect to submit a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or submit an appeal to the Board.  A claimant cannot elect multiple review options simultaneously for the same claim.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501.  Such concurrent election is specifically prohibited by 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b), which states, "[A] claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option."

The Board finds that the acceptance of the April 2024 VA Form 10182 as to the claim of service connection for sleep apnea was in error.  The Veteran's December 2023 request for a higher level of review had not been resolved prior to VA receiving the VA Form 10182.  As the present appeal for service connection for sleep apnea is a concurrent election prohibited under controlling law and regulation, the appeal as to that claim must be dismissed. 

2. An increased rating for left ear hearing loss is dismissed.

An appeal of a decision by the AOJ consists of a Notice of Disagreement submitted to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.201.  A claimant must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (a).  If a Notice of Disagreement is not filed within the one-year period, the decision becomes final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160 (d)(2), 20.1103.

If the Veteran submits an untimely VA Form 10182 (for rating decisions issued under the AMA) or submits an incorrect form to appeal a given rating decision, the appeal may be dismissed due to non-jurisdictional reasons, such as a procedural defect, where the claimant did not substantially comply with proper claims processing rules.  See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (stating VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings, but a failure to follow claims processing does not affect the Board's jurisdiction): see also Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021).

In a March 2023 rating decision, the RO continued the Veteran's left ear hearing loss disability rating.  The Veteran was notified of that determination on March 17, 2023.  VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 on April 17, 2024.  Accordingly, to the extent the Veteran may have sought to appeal the AOJ's denial of an increased rating for left ear hearing loss in the March 2023 rating decision, he did not comply with the claims processing rules for the appeal.  In the March 2023 Notification Letter, the AOJ notified the Veteran that if he disagreed with the decision, he must complete and return a VA Form 10182 within one year of the date of the notification letter.  Therefore, the Veteran was adequately informed as to how and by when to appeal the March 2023 rating decision.  Therefore, the Board finds that the April 2024 VA Form 10182 was untimely as to the March 2023 rating decision.

The Board has also considered the applicability of a waiver that would permit extending the filing period but finds no such evidence.  See Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 333 (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45 (2009).  The Veteran did not file a motion for an extension and he has not provided good cause to extend the filing period, and no other waiver is applicable here.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.203, 3.109(b).

The Board has also considered whether it waived its right to enforce the filing deadline by virtue of docketing the appeal.  See Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46-47 (holding that VA waived any objections to the timeliness of the substantive appeal because VA consistently treated the case as if it had been on appeal).  Whether the Board has waived any objection to timeliness of a notice of disagreement should be based on all facts and circumstances.

In this case, following the Veteran's April 2024 VA Form 10182, the Board sent an April 2024 letter acknowledging receipt of the VA Form 10182 and placement of the appeal on the direct review docket, as was elected on the Veteran's VA Form 10182.  The Board finds, however, that sending the letter acknowledging receipt of the Veteran's VA Form 10182 and the mere administrative act of assigning an appeal docket, in and of itself, does not constitute a waiver of timeliness by the Board.  In this case, the Board took no actions that could lead the Veteran to believe that the merits of the case were being examined and developed in a substantive way.  Moreover, the Board's notice of receipt of the Veteran's purported appeal did not convey any intent to waive any procedural defect caused by the Veteran's failure to file a timely VA Form 10182.  Thus, the Board finds that mere sending of the docketing letter did not constitute a waiver of the timeliness requirements for the Veteran's VA Form 10182.

Based on the foregoing, as no good cause has been shown and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made as to the timeliness of the April 2024 VA Form 10182, the Board finds that the April 2024 VA Form 10182 was untimely.  Accordingly, the present appeal must be dismissed based on Veteran's failure to comply with the claims processing rules.

3. An increased rating in excess of 20 percent for cervical strain is denied.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary of VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

With initial ratings assigned with a grant of service connection, separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings."  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999).

Disabilities of the spine are evaluated under either the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Rating Formula), or under the formula for rating intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) based on incapacitating episodes (Diagnostic Code 5243), whichever method results in the higher evaluation when all disabilities are combined under 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.

The General Rating Formula provides a 20 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.

A 30 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the cervical spine 15 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.

A 40 percent rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a , Diagnostic Codes 5235-5243.

There are several notes set out after the applicable diagnostic criteria. First, associated objective neurologic abnormalities are to be rated separately under an appropriate Diagnostic Code. Second, for purposes of VA compensation, normal forward flexion of the cervical spine is zero to 45 degrees, extension is zero to 30 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 45 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 80 degrees. The combined range of motion refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation. The normal combined range of motion of the cervical spine is 340 degrees. Third, in exceptional cases, an examiner may state that, because of age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other factors not the result of disease or injury of the spine, the range of motion of the spine in a particular individual should be considered normal for that particular individual, even though spine motion does not conform to the normal range of motion stated in the regulation. Fourth, each specific range of motion should be rounded to the nearest 5 degrees. Finally, for VA purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the entire cervical spine, entire thoracolumbar spine, or entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficult walking because of a limited line of vision, restricted opening of the veteran's mouth and chewing, breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration, gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen, dyspnea or the existence of any dysphagia, atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation, or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a , Diagnostic Codes 5235-5243.

In evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, it is necessary to consider, along with the schedular criteria, functional loss due to flare-ups of pain, fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, and weakness.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.40, consideration must be given to functional loss due to pain and weakness causing additional disability beyond that reflected by range of motion measurements.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.45, consideration must be given to whether there is less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, deformity or atrophy of disuse.  Painful, unstable, or misaligned joints, due to healed injury, are entitled to at least the minimal compensable rating for the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  Although pain may be a cause or manifestation of functional loss, limitation of motion due to pain is not necessarily rated at the same level as functional loss where motion is impeded.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).

Under the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes, ratings are assigned based on the duration of such episodes in the period of a year (in terms of weeks).  An incapacitating episode is defined as a period of acute signs and symptoms of IVDS that requires bedrest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.  See Note 1 following the criteria for rating on such basis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Note (1) to the General Formula specifies that any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, should be separately evaluated under an appropriate diagnostic code.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

The Veteran asserts his cervical strain warrants a higher disability rating.  

The Veteran was afforded two VA examinations during the evidentiary period.  In 2022, the Veteran was noted to have two to three severe flare-ups of his cervical strain per week.  See December 2022 C&P Exam.  His neck pain caused functional loss as it interfered with the Veteran's ability to drive a vehicle.  The Veteran used topical over-the-counter creams for his pain.  Initial range of motion found forward flexion of the cervical spine limited to 30 degrees and a combined range of motion of the cervical spine of 235 degrees.  He was able to complete three repetitions with no additional loss of range of motion or function. The Veteran was not examined during a flare-up but the examiner estimated his forward flexion to be 25 degrees with a combined range of motion of the cervical spine of 195 degrees during a flareup.  The Veteran had localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or spinal contour.  He had normal strength and reflexes and did not have muscle atrophy, spasms, guarding, ankylosis, or IVDS symptoms.

In a 2023 examination, the Veteran asserted he had pain in the cervical spine for which he used an over-the-counter topical pain reliever.  See July 2023 C&P Exam.  Initial range of motion found forward flexion of the cervical spine limited to 30 degrees and a combined range of motion of the cervical spine to 200 degrees.  He was able to do three repetitions with forward flexion limited to 25 degrees and a combined range of motion of the cervical spine limited to 155 degrees.  The Veteran was not examined during a flare-up and the examiner did not estimate range of motion; however, the examiner noted the evidence (including statements from the Veteran) did not suggest significantly limited functional ability with flareups.  The Veteran did not have crepitus, localized tenderness, guarding, muscle spasms, abnormal strength, muscle atrophy, ankylosis, or IVDS symptoms.

During the period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected condition warranted a 20 percent rating.  The Veteran was documented to have forward flexion of the cervical spine at between 25 and 30 degrees with no functional loss after repetitive motion.  There was also no documentation of ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.  Additionally, the Veteran's forward flexion of the cervical spine (even during a flare-up) was not 15 degrees or less.

The Board has considered whether the Veteran's neck disability is more appropriately rated based on incapacitating episodes of IVDS and finds it is not.  There is no evidence that the Veteran has experienced incapacitating episodes of IVDS.  Whether the Veteran has IVDS is a medical question.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  It was noted on all VA examinations that he does not have IVDS and there was no medical record evidence of a diagnosis of IVDS.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 20 percent for cervical strain.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against higher ratings, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).   Accordingly, the appeal in this matter must be denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

An increased rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD is remanded.

The Veteran asserts his GERD symptomatology warrants a higher disability rating.  VA treatment records consistently note that the Veteran received all treatment for GERD symptomatology with private providers.  However, VA has not requested these records nor has VA notified the Veteran of his duty to assist in developing the evidentiary record for his claim.

The Board finds the failure to obtain these records constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist omission.  Therefore, a remand is necessary to obtain complete treatment records from the Veteran's private treating providers.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain any outstanding and ongoing private treatment records relevant to the claim on appeal.  Ask the Veteran to identify all private providers of evaluations or treatment he received for his service-connected gastroesophageal reflux disease which are not already in the record, and to submit authorizations for VA to secure complete clinical records from all private providers.

A copy of any requests sent to private treatment providers and all replies must be included in the claims file.  If any records cannot be obtained after reasonable efforts have been made, issue a formal determination that such records do not exist or that further efforts to obtain such records would be futile, which should be documented in the claims file.

2. Next, the AOJ should review all newly obtained private treatment records regarding the Veteran's service-connected GERD and readjudicate the claim for an increased rating on the merits in the first instance.
