REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the U.S. Marine Corps from September 2008 to September 2012.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 higher level review of an April 2023 supplemental rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In May 2024, the appellant submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

To the extent that in her VA Form 10182 the Veteran submitted a substantive appeal concerning entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability and vertigo, these issues will be addressed in a separate decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is remanded.

The Veteran contends that she currently experiences a back disability related a back disability she received treatment for during service.  She asserts that her back pain began during her service in Southwest Asia and is related to wear and tear due military occupational specialty (MOS) (warehouse supply).  The Veteran reported that "sometimes it hurts to walk" and that her pain "comes and goes."  See July 2019 VA Examination; June 2014 VA examination.

Turning to the evidence of record, in June 2014, the Veteran was provided a VA examination and diagnosed with lumbar strain, acute resolved.  A VA examiner opined that the Veteran's current back disability is less likely than not related to service.  He noted that the Veteran had acute back pain while in the service which was evaluated in 2009 and then in 2011 and treated with physical therapy and chiropractic care.  He also explained that the Veteran had not received any medical care for her back since 2011.  As there was no chronicity in care, there is no linkage between the Veteran's current back pain and her inservice back pain. 

Likewise, in July 2019, a VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion.  He explained that there was no indication in the record that the prior June 2014 opinion was in error. 

Unfortunately, the June 2014 and July 2019 VA opinions are not wholly adequate, as the examiner did not address the Veteran's lay statements with regard to her current symptoms or continuous symptomology.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 261 (2020) (stating that a VA examiner's failure to consider the Veteran's relevant lay statements when formulating an opinion renders that opinion inadequate); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018).  Rather, the examiner relied solely on a lack of treatment since service.  See Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 137, 140 (1992); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 40 (2007). Finally, the examiner also failed to address the Veteran's theory of entitlement that her current symptoms may be related to her MOS. 

Accordingly, these opinions are inadequate for adjudication purposes.  As this amounts to a predecisional duty to assist error, the Board finds that a remand is warranted for the AOJ to obtain a new VA medical opinion.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate medical specialist with respect to the Veteran's claim for service connection claim for a back disability.  The need for an examination is left to the discretion of the examiner. 

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records, to include previous examinations, service treatment records, lay statements, and private treatment records associated with the claims file and offer an opinion as to the following questions:

(a)	Identify any currently diagnosed back disabilities. 

In doing so, the examiner is reminded that pursuant to Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), pain causing or resulting in functional impairment can constitute a disability.

(b)	Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any diagnosed back disability is related to service, to include the Veteran's MOS.

A complete rationale should accompany any opinion provided.

The examiner is reminded that the Veteran is competent to attest to matters within her personal knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical reason to support or to doubt the statements provided by the Veteran, the examiner should fully explain that reason.

The examiner is also reminded an examination is inadequate where the examiner relies on the absence of evidence in the STRs to provide a negative opinion. 

If the examiner cannot provide the requested opinion without resorting to speculation, it must be so stated, and the examiner must provide a statement as to whether there is additional information that would enable the examiner to provide the requested opinion or whether the requested opinion is beyond the limits of medical knowledge.
