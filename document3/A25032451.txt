REMANDED

Entitlement to burial benefits is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Coast Guard from August 1967 to June 1968.  The Veteran died in April 2021.  The Appellant is identified as the Veteran's fiancée.  

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  84 Fed. Reg. 138,171 (Jan. 18, 2019).  This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA's) decision on their claim to seek review.  The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.

In December 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review) and requested review of a December 2021 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision.  In March 2023, the AOJ issued a decision which considered the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 decision.  In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

While the Board regrets additional delay in the adjudication of this claim, the Board notes that the Appellant has a pending claim in the Legacy appeal system seeking service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  Such was most recently remanded by the Board in February 2025 for additional development.  Notably, the Appellant's attorney has submitted a motion to vacate the February 2025 Board remand, stating the Appellant opted into the AMA appeal system in February 2025 by filing a VA Form 20-0996, requesting review of a December 2024 Supplemental Statement of the Case.  

Because the burial benefits claim is inextricably intertwined with the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder remaining on appeal in the Legacy appeal system, appellate consideration of entitlement to burial benefits is deferred pending resolution of the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder remaining on appeal in the Legacy appeal system.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991); see also Tyrues v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 166, 177 (2009) (en banc) (explaining that claims are inextricably intertwined where the adjudication of one claim could have a significant impact on the adjudication of another claim).
