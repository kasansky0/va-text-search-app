REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Marine Corps from July 1968 to November 1969.

This appeal falls under the provisions of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  84 Fed. Reg. 138, 169 (Jan. 18, 2019); 38 C.F.R. § 19.2.  This law creates a new framework for veterans dissatisfied with the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) decision on their claim to seek review.  This Board decision is consistent with the new AMA framework.

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held with the undersigned on February 12, 2025.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims listed above, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for CAD status post-acute, subacute or old myocardial infarction and status post coronary artery bypass graft.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to earlier effective dates for the grants of service connection for CAD and PTSD.  The applicable law and regulations concerning effective dates state that, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  There is no provision in either the statutes or the regulations that allows for an earlier effective date unless a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) was committed in a prior decision or new and material evidence, in the form of relevant military records, was received after the final decision.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5110 (i), 7111; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.156 (c).  The Board notes that under the AMA framework, it may only remand an issue to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist or notify error, if the remand will assist in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

The Board finds that the AOJ committed a predecisional duty to assist error.  The Board notes that the Veteran alleged CUE in the assignment of effective dates for his CAD and PTSD on his July 2024 Supplemental Claim.  However, the AOJ failed to address this assertion in the rating decision on appeal.  Based on this failure, the Board must remand these matters to allow the AOJ to address the Veteran's assertion of CUE in the assignment of effective dates for CAD and PTSD.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Readjudicate the Veteran's CAD and PTSD claims addressing his assertions that the February 1996 and October 2014 rating decisions were based on clear and unmistakable error.
