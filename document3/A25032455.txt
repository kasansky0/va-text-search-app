ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 14, 2022 for the award of a 40 percent rating for lumbar spondylosis, lumbosacral strain, degenerative arthritis and intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) (previously rated as mechanical low back strain) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

On February 14, 2022, VA received a 21-0819-VA/DoD Joint Disability Evaluation Board Claim, followed by a February 15, 2022 VA 21-526EZ for lumbar spondylosis; it is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability increased in severity within one year of that claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to February 14, 2022, for the award of an increased rating to 40 percent for lumbar spondylosis, lumbosacral strain, degenerative arthritis and IVDS have not been met.  38 U.S.C.§§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2005 to November 2006. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2022 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which increased the disability rating for the Veteran's lumbar spine disability from 10 percent to 40 percent, effective February 14, 2022.

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review and requested an effective date earlier than February 14, 2022 for the increase, most recently addressed in a July 2023 rating decision.

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 14, 2022 for the award of a 40 percent rating for lumbar spondylosis, lumbosacral strain, degenerative arthritis and IVDS.

Generally, the effective date of an award is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless otherwise provided.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Entitlement arises on the date the claimant meets the basic eligibility criteria.  For increased rating claims, if the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (Sept. 23, 1998).  If the increase occurred more than a year prior to the claim, the effective date shall be the date of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  Finally, if the increase occurs after the claim is filed, the effective date shall be the date the increase occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126-27 (1997).

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term date entitlement arose is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a facts found basis.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the AOJ receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers.  McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

Therefore, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of a case: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable), otherwise; (3) date of receipt of claim.  See Harper, 10 Vet. App. at 126; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Prior to March 24, 2015, the law provided that a specific claim in the form prescribed by VA must be filed for VA benefits to be paid. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.160.  The term "claim" or "application" meant a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its rules as to what constitutes a claim for benefits; such now requires that claims be made on specific claim form prescribed by the Secretary and available online or at the local Regional Office.  This provision effectively removed informal claims from VA's processes.

Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA could be considered an informal claim.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim had not been filed, an application form was to be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, the formal claim was considered to have been filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  When a claim had been filed which met the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.151, an informal request for increase or reopening was accepted as a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(2014).

In general, decisions of a VA Regional Office and the Board that are not appealed in the prescribed time period are final.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.1100, 20.1103.  Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.  CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error."  It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.  See Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).

The Board concludes that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of an effective date prior to February 14, 2022, for the assignment of a 40 percent for lumbar spine disability as it is not factually ascertainable that this disability met the criteria for a higher rating within one year prior to VA's receipt of his February 14, 2022 claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A September 24, 2007, rating decision granted service connection for mechanical low back strain at a 10 percent rating effective November 25, 2006.  A September 2007 VA letter notified the Veteran of this decision and how to appeal.

On February 14, 2022, VA received a 21-0819-VA/DoD Joint Disability Evaluation Board Claim.  On February 15, 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA 21-526EZ for lumbar spondylosis.

The December 2022 rating decision granted a 40 percent rating for lumbar spondylosis, lumbosacral strain, degenerative arthritis and IVDS, effective from February 14, 2022, the date of receipt of the 21-0819-VA/DoD Joint Disability Evaluation Board Claim.  This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with the effective date assigned for the increased rating.

Having carefully reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds no basis for the assignment of an effective date prior to February 14, 2022, for a 40 percent rating for lumbar spine disability.

First, the September 2007 rating decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.  VA letter, dated in September 2007, notified the Veteran of the rating decision and how to appeal and/or the review options.  However, VA received no appeal of the September 2007 rating decision, or new and material evidence prior to expiration of the appeal period for this decision as to lumbar spine disability.

Second, the record does not contain any pending unadjudicated claim for increase for lumbar spine disability subsequent to the September 2007 decision and prior to the February 14, 2022 claim.  Following the September 2007 decision, the Veteran's next communication to VA was the February 14, 2022 claim.  Here, the Veteran has not asserted, and the record does not reflect, that he filed an intent to file or a formal claim for increased rating for lumbar spine disability after the September 2007 rating decision and prior to the February 2022 claim for increase.

Additionally, the Board finds that the date of claim for increase for lumbar spine disability is established as February 14, 2022.  Although an effective date may be assigned during the one-year look-back preceding the date of claim for increase, the Board finds that is not factually ascertainable that lumbar spine disability met the criteria for a higher rating, or that he reported any symptoms of lumbar spine disability during that one-year period prior to February 14, 2022.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  See also, Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511, 519 (1997), (Section 5110(b)(2) is invoked only where it has been determined that the evidence warrants an increase to the next disability level; because an increase to the next disability level is required to invoke subsection (b)(2), "an increase" is most logically construed in that context to mean an increase to the next disability level.).

Indeed, it is not factually ascertainable that an increase in lumbar spine disability within one year prior to the date of claim, February 14, 2022.

The Veteran's lumbar spine disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243, pertaining to IVDS.  Regulations pertaining to Diagnostic Code 5243 were recently amended.  Effective February 7, 2021, revisions to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a added instruction to assign this diagnostic code only when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve route, which has not been diagnosed in this case.  Therefore, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability is determined by the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id. at Note 1.

Unfavorable ankylosis is defined as "a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching."  Id. at Note 5.  Additionally, fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) is "always" considered favorable ankylosis.  Id. 

The criteria for a rating based on ankylosis may be met by evidence demonstrating the functional equivalent of it such as when the Veteran's symptoms more most prevalent ("flare ups") or during prolonged or repeated use of his low back.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021). Therefore, ankylosis can be shown via functional loss akin to it.  See also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011); and DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).

Based on a review of the record, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence of record does not show it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability symptoms increased in severity to the next disability level prior to his claim for increase on February 14, 2022.

In this regard, the Veteran's VA treatment records show that on February 20, 2021, the Veteran presented to the emergency department for lower back pain.  He reported exacerbation of lower back pain with movement radiating to the hips, two months ago.  The assessment was bilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy.  March 17, 2021 lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed transitional-lumbarized S1 segment, mild lumbar spondylosis and disc degenerative disease, with no high-grade canal or foraminal narrowing.  

The Veteran argues that an effective date of May 10, 2021 is warranted because a May 10, 2021 VA treatment record showed worsening of the lumbar spine disability.  In this regard, a May 10, 2021 VA primary care note reflects the Veteran's report that his low back pain had been worsening slowly over time.  He reported that sitting for more than a short amount of time would cause numbness and tingling in his legs.  The assessment was lumbar spondylosis and disc degenerative disease, degenerative disc disease and spondylosis with moderate arthritic change noted on most recent MRI.  The physician noted that when compared with MRI dated 2014 and CT scan dated 2016 progression of neural foraminal stenosis was seen in the lumbar spine.  It was further noted that the Veteran was recently evaluated by neuropathy and decreased sensation with lower lumbar radiculopathy was found.  The physician stated that an increase was seen in vertebral disc protrusion with intervention on the thecal sac and fissuring, which led to mild canal stenosis noted at L3/4 and L4/5 on imaging from 2021 that was not present on imaging from 2014.  The physician further stated that this would indicate worsening of the Veteran's condition which would likely lead to worsening of radicular symptoms.

Based on this evidence, the Board acknowledges that there had been worsening of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability symptoms since 2014.  However, there is insufficient evidence to show the required findings of an increase to the next disability level under the applicable Diagnostic Code.  

To meet the criteria for a 40 percent rating under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, it must be shown that the Veteran's lumbar spine forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine was limited to 30 degrees or less; or it manifested by favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  The medical evidence during the one-year look back period prior to February 14, 2022 is devoid of such finding.  Any reports of worsening symptoms of lumbar spine disability prior to February 2022 are vague in terms of the degree of limitation of motion and do not provide evidence of ascertainable increase to the next disability level prior to February 2022.  

Although VA treatment records show that the Veteran experienced exacerbation of lower back pain which prompted a visit to the emergency room on February 20, 2021, the nature of his complaint pertained to his lower back pain now radiating to his hips and legs and the resulting assessment was bilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy.  Concerning this, the Board observes that the Veteran has already been granted separate ratings of 10 percent for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy, respectively, in a May 2022 rating decision.  As such, the Board considers the effective date of any neurological disability to be separate and distinct and, therefore, is not considered here.  See De Hart v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 371, 380 (2024).

The Board finds that the persuasive evidence of record does not show, and it is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability symptoms increased in severity to the next disability level prior to his intent to file on February 14, 2022.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston, 605 F.3d at 979.  

As explained in detail above, the Board finds no basis for the assignment of an effective date prior to February 14, 2022, for the assignment of a 40 percent for lumbar spine disability.  Accordingly, the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
