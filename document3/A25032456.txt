REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for colon cancer, to include as due to herbicide agent exposure, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1969 to February 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in January 2024 VA Form 10182 and elected to have a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the case, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Veteran testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in December 2024.  A transcript of the proceeding has been associated with the claims file.

Upon review, the Board finds that a remand is needed to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Veteran has claimed that developed colon cancer due to herbicide agent exposure in service.  His military personnel records show that he served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era.  Therefore, he is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents during his military service. 38 C.F.R.  3.307.  The AOJ also made favorable findings in the May 2023 rating decision that he is presumed to have such exposure and that he has been diagnosed with colon cancer.

Although colon cancer is not on the list of diseases that VA has associated with herbicide agent exposure, the regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(d), 3.309(e); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007) (holding that the availability of presumptive service connection for some conditions based on exposure to Agent Orange does not preclude direct service connection for other conditions based on exposure to Agent Orange).

A May 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's colon cancer was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies) (TERA), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran.  She noted that he underwent a colon resection in 1997 and was diagnosed with carcinoma of the colon again in 2017.  She stated that the disorder has not been linked to Agent Orange exposure.  However, the examiner did not provide any explanation or basis for that statement. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (an adequate medical opinion must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate for the Board to consider and weigh against other evidence of record).  Moreover, she did not address the Veteran's claim that his colon cancer was due to exposure to burn pits in service. See August 2022 statement; September 2022 report of general information.  Therefore, the Board finds that an additional medical opinion was needed.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ should obtain a VA medical opinion to determine the etiology of the Veteran's colon cancer.  A physical examination is only needed if one is deemed necessary by the individual providing the opinion.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file, including the Veteran's service treatment records, post-service medical records, and assertions.

The examiner should note that the Veteran is competent to attest to matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.

The examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's colon cancer is causally or etiologically related to his military service, to include exposure to herbicide agents therein (regardless of the fact that colon cancer is not presumed to be associated with herbicide exposure).

The examiner should also address the Veteran's claim that exposure to toxic smoke from burn pits or fire pits in Vietnam caused his colon cancer. See, e.g., August 2022 statement; September 2022 report of general information; January 2024 lay statements; December 2024 Board hearing transcript.

The examiner should consider the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities (TERA).

A clear rationale should be provided for all opinions.
