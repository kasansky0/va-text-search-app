ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for optic nerve drusen is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus (claimed as a pre-existing condition aggravated by active duty service) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to increased ratings for right ankle tendinosis (currently rated 10 percent disabling effective October 12, 2022) is remanded.

Entitlement to increased ratings for left ankle tendinosis (currently rated 10 percent disabling effective October 12, 2022) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Throughout the appellate period, there is no competent or credible evidence to suggest that the Veteran has ever had a diagnosis of hearing loss in either ear to constitute a disability for VA rating purposes.

2. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record is at least evenly balanced to support a finding that his optic nerve drusen is secondary to service-connected sleep apnea.

3. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his bilateral pes planus was noted as preexisting active duty service but became permanently aggravated as a result of active duty service, and said aggravation is not clearly and unmistakably limited to natural progression of the disorder.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for optic nerve drusen have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus (claimed as a pre-existing condition aggravated by active duty service) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1153, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 11, 2019 to October 11, 2022.  The claims on appeal come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a November 7, 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  This rating decision was subjected to Higher-Level Review, and the HLR rating decision was issued on March 29, 2024.  These claims are initial: the Veteran's bilateral ankles are service connected effective October 12, 2022, and he as prosecuted claims for higher ratings ever since; meanwhile, the Veteran has been continuously prosecuting the remaining claims for service connection ever since a date no later than one year after discharge.  For all claims on appeal, the appellate begins on October 12, 2022, and since the Veteran was discharged from active duty service on October 11, 2022, the Board cannot award any benefits prior to October 12, 2022.

In the June 3, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 7, 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, even if the November 7, 2023 rating decision underwent HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  The appeal is timely for being within one year of the HLR rating decision, but the NOD was also received within one year of the rating decision on appeal. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the claims for increased ratings for the bilateral ankles, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

In certain instances, the Board can interpret a claim for a rating of total disability due to individual unemployability based upon service-connected disorders (TDIU) as part and parcel of claims for increased ratings. See generally Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  Even though there are claims for increased ratings on appeal, the Board concludes that TDIU is not on appeal.  In a May 2023 VA examination pertaining to sleep apnea, the examiner determined that the sleep apnea does impact his ability to work, because "Veteran has difficulty concentrating and focusing at work due to falling asleep and feeling tired." See C&P Exam ( May 23, 2023 ), at Question No. 6.  Sleep apnea is not otherwise on appeal, but the Board can review any permissible evidence that might be relevant to the matter of a TDIU, including relevance to determine whether the claim needs to be adjudicated.  The Board interprets that conclusion being in the present tense as circumstantial evidence that he was employed as of the examination; therefore, the current employment precludes the possibility that TDIU should be on appeal.  There is accordingly no pre-decisional error in the AOJ's not developing a claim not before it.  The Veteran is free to file a Supplemental Claim for TDIU if he should ever unemployed due to service-connected disabilities (at the exclusion of non-service-connected causes) and desire to claim the benefit in the future.

The Federal Circuit has held that VA's duty to assist includes the duty to obtain VA medical records, regardless of the relevancy of those records. See Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  On November 2, 2023, the AOJ performed a diligent search for the Veteran's VA medical records, and a negative search result is of record. See VA Medical Records (rec'd Nov. 2, 2023 ).  The Board will not remand for records that likely do not exist, and the Board is determining that the AOJ discharged this portion of the duty to assist.  If the Veteran has any pertinent VA medical records, then he is free to file a Supplemental Claim at any time.

The November 7, 2023 rating decision on appeal lists the evidence that was considered.  This list includes the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, which was received on July 16, 2023; however, this list does not include any of the favorable evidence received on July 14, 2023, which accordingly includes private etiological opinions by a Dr. M.S.  For all claims on appeal except for service connection for bilateral hearing loss, the Board characterizes the AOJ's failure to consider that evidence as a pre-decisional error in violation of the duty to assist.  This pre-decisional error will prevent the Board from denying any claims, for fear of unlawfully prejudicing the Veteran.  Of these claims, the Veteran cannot be prejudiced by the remand for higher ratings for the bilateral ankles, and the grants for service connection (optic nerve drusen, and bilateral pes planus as pre-existing but aggravated) appear to be full grants of benefits available on appeal, so the Veteran cannot be prejudiced in those respects either. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (where the law, not the evidence, is dispositive, the appeal should be terminated for lack of legal merit or entitlement).

On the other hand, for service connection for bilateral hearing loss, 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(a) specifies that "An examination for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a Puretone audiometry test. Examinations will be conducted without the use of hearing aids."  Dr. M.S. medical degrees are Doctor of Medicine (MD) and Master of Public Health (MPH).  There is no evidence that the Veteran is a Doctor of Audiology (Au.D.).  Without this specific accreditation, the Board concludes that Dr. M.S. is not competent to offer any opinion about the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss; therefore, the Board will not identify any pre-decisional error in the AOJ's failure to consider Dr. M.S.'s opinions about the Veteran's hearing loss.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.304.  Service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Walker v. Shinseki, 701 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In addition, for certain chronic diseases, such as organic diseases of the nervous system, a presumption of service connection arises if the disease is manifested to a degree of 10 percent within one year following discharge from service.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).  When a chronic disease is not shown within one year after service, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support a claim for such diseases; however, such continuity of symptomatology may only support a claim for those chronic diseases listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that §§ 1110 and 1131's requirement of the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary); see also McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 323 (2007) (holding that the requirement of a current disability is met when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim).  Consequently, the evidence of record must show that the Veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

For service connection, it is not required that a hearing loss disability by the standards of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 be demonstrated during service, although a hearing loss disability by these standards must be currently present, and service connection is possible if the current hearing loss disability can be adequately linked to service.  Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Veteran's exposure to hazardous noise has been conceded, by virtue of his military occupational specialty. See Rating Decision (Apr. 1, 2023), at Page 7 of 9; see also 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  The only remaining questions are (a) whether the Veteran has a hearing loss disability for VA rating purposes at any time during the appellate period in either ear or both ears, and (b) if so, whether same is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) attributable to active duty service.

On April 25, 2022, the Veteran underwent audiometric testing.  The authorized VA examination audiogram is associated with the claims file.  The results are listed below:

			HERTZ				CNC

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	AVG	%

RIGHT	10	10	15	10	15	12.5	100

LEFT	10	10	10	5	10	8.75	100

See C&P Exam (Apr. 25, 2022).  As shown here, audiometric testing results did not demonstrate hearing loss in either ear that is recognizable for VA compensation purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The Board cannot locate any other competent or credible audiogram within the Veteran's claims file.  There is also no competent or credible evidence to suggest that the Veteran's hearing has worsened to the point that there is any reason to doubt that this examination still accurately reflects the Veteran's current hearing.

As the record does not reflect a current diagnosis of hearing loss in either ear for VA purposes, the cornerstone element of service connection has not been met, and service connection is not warranted.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  VA treatment records do not document diagnosis for bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes. The Board does not find a basis for determining that there is any hearing loss that results in functional impairment.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The Veteran has not alleged manifestations of similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person.  Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8 (2020).  

The Board acknowledges the statements of the Veteran as to the existence and etiology of his decreased hearing acuity and acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to give evidence about what he experienced during active duty service.  See, e.g., Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  However, while the Veteran is competent to report his current symptoms, as a lay person he does not have the education, training, or experience to diagnose or opine as to the etiology of the condition.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In the absence of proof of a present disability (and, if so, of a nexus between that disability and service), there can be no valid claim for service connection.  See Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, supra. Therefore, as the evidence of record shows that the Veteran does not have a hearing loss disability in either ear for VA purposes at any time during the appellate period, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted, and no further discussion of the remaining elements is necessary.  See Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309, 314 (1993) ("A determination of service connection requires a finding of the existence of a current disability and a determination of a relationship between that disability and an injury or a disease incurred in service."); see also Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006) (finding that the absence of any one element will result in denial of service connection).  

As stated above, the Board acknowledges certain statements that Dr. M.S. provided in support of the Veteran's claims.  Because Dr. M.S. is not an audiologist, the Board affords those statements no probative weight for this issue on appeal, and the Board sees no pre-decisional error in violation of any duty to assist in the AOJ's not considering Dr. M.S.'s opinions about the Veteran's hearing loss.  Assuming arguendo that Dr. M.S.'s opinions about the Veteran's hearing loss are entitled to any probative weight at all, the Board determines that the Veteran does not have a valid hearing loss disability for VA purposes at any time during the appellate period, see Boyer, supra; Brammer, supra; Watson, supra; Coburn, supra.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence of record is persuasively against the claim for bilateral hearing loss.  The appeal is hereby DENIED.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.  

2. Entitlement to service connection for optic nerve drusen is granted.

Service connection also may be established on a secondary basis for: (1) a disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury; or (2) any increase in the severity of a nonservice-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the nonservice-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.310(a)-(b); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (explaining 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b)).  

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  As relevant to this issue on appeal, the Veteran has been service-connected for sleep apnea ever since October 12, 2022, i.e.: throughout the complete appellate period. See generally Rating Decision (Codesheet) (Mar. 29, 2024).

All previous rating decisions of record characterize the Veteran's optic nerve drusen as incidental findings, but not of a diagnosis. See generally Brammer, supra; Rating Decisions (Apr. 1, 2023; Nov. 7, 2023; Mar. 29, 2024).  Nevertheless, a May 17, 2022 VA examination appears to concede this as a valid diagnosis. See C&P Exam (May 17, 2022, rec'd May 18, 2022), at Page 3 of 13, Section I, Questions Nos. 1A (selecting "Yes" to "Does the Veteran currently have an eye condition (other than congenital or developmental errors of refraction)?") and 1B ("The given diagnosis optic nerve drusen affects the both eyes [sic].").  The Board concludes that the finding of a diagnosed eye disorder (whether optic nerve drusen or otherwise) is a favorable finding of fact predating this Board adjudication, so the Board must resolve all reasonable doubt and determine that the Veteran has a diagnosed eye disorder.

The only remaining question is whether the Veteran's current eye disorder is attributable to service.  The Board notes that the record contains numerous medical opinions which must be considered and weighed. See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 69-70 (1993) (citing Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192-93 (1992)). See also Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-471 (1993) (stating that the probative value of medical evidence is based on the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician reaches; as is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the Board). When faced with conflicting medical opinions, the Board may favor one medical opinion over the other. See Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998), citing Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995). The Board will consider these opinions below.

The May 2022 examination concludes with an opinion that "Optic nerve drusen is a primary condition unrelated to military service." See C&P Exam (May 17, 2022), at Page 13 of 13, Section VIII, Question No. 1.  This is a bare and conclusory opinion with no supporting rationale. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions.").  Furthermore, if the examiner is using the term "primary condition" to mean "as opposed to a diagnosis," then the Board has resolved that point in the Veteran's favor, by assuming that he has a valid diagnosis, including but not limited to his optic nerve drusen.  This opinion is given minimal probative weight, but in the event that it is entitled to any further weight, the Board notes in passing that it appears to only be an opinion pertaining to direct service connection.

On July 14, 2023, the AOJ received the Veteran's private etiological opinions from the aforementioned Dr. M.S. See Correspondence (July 11, 2023, rec'd July 14, 2023).  With respect to the optic nerve drusen, Dr. M.S. recounted the following: 

The Veteran reports that he has undergone eye exams his whole life, and there has been no indication that Drusen was developing until after he was out of service.  This issue is being caused and aggravated due to his OSA [obstructive sleep apnea].  There are studies who [sic] have shown that OSA may be associated with the development of macular degeneration which in turn can lead to Drusen.  The Veteran reports that he was diagnosed in 2022.  

Therefore, based on the Veteran's account and relevant records, we can assume that his optic nerve drusen is more likely than not being caused and aggravated by his OSA.  No foreseen material improvement will be maintained under ordinary conditions of work and life.

See id. at Page 7 of 22, last two paragraphs of section "Service Connection for Optic Nerve Drusen."  An etiological opinion based wholly on accepting the Veteran's contentions as true would not be entitled to probative weight, see Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458 (1993) (medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value); Nieves-Rodriguez, supra; Stefl, supra, but the Board determines that there is sufficient medical documentation of an eye disability, sleep apnea is confirmed as service-connected, and the Veteran is competent to offer credible testimony about his medical history and how his poor eyesight affects his daily life.  

Ultimately, the Board determines that Dr. M.S.'s etiological opinion is entitled to moderate probative weight, but no matter how little probative weight it might be entitled to, and even if the Board were to assign more probative weight to the negative opinion than the positive opinion, the positive opinion as secondary to sleep apnea is uncontroverted.  This is because the negative opinion of record is about direct service connection, and there is no negative etiological opinion of record against the finding that sleep apnea causes the eye disorder.  For these reasons, the Board cannot escape the conclusion that the Veteran's bilateral eye disorder (claimed as optic nerve drusen) is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) secondary to sleep apnea.  The Board would be precluded from remanding for the purpose of associating negative evidence against a Veteran's claim with the claims file.  See Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).  Furthermore, when the evidence is at least evenly balanced to grant a claim in full, a remand would cause undue delay in adjudicating the claim.  See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991).  By granting the claim in full now, the Board can ensure that the Veteran is not so prejudiced.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  Service connection for a bilateral eye disorder is warranted and must be GRANTED.  The evidence of record is at least evenly balanced, so the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  This is a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal; therefore, there is no remaining reasonable doubt to resolve.

3. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus (claimed as a pre-existing condition aggravated by active duty service) is granted.

Every veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b). Therefore, where there is evidence showing that a disorder manifested or was incurred in service, and this disorder is not noted on the veteran's entrance examination report, this presumption of soundness operates to shield the veteran from any finding that the unnoted disease or injury preexisted service. See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012); Bagby v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 225, 227 (1991); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).

Such presumption is only rebutted where the evidence clearly and unmistakably shows that the veteran's disability (1) existed before acceptance and enrollment into service and (2) was not aggravated by service. See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Bagby, 1 Vet. App. at 227; VAOPGCPREC 3-2003 (July 16, 2003). The two parts of this rebuttal standard are referred to as the "preexistence prong" and the "aggravation prong." Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 234 (2012). To satisfy this second-prong requirement for rebutting the presumption of soundness, the government must show by clear and unmistakable evidence either that there was no increase in disability during service or that any increase in disability was "due to the natural progression" of the condition. Joyce v. Nicholson, 443 F.3d 845, 847 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

38 U.S.C. § 1153 provides that a preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active military, naval, or air service, where there is an increase in disability during such service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease. The occurrence of symptoms, in the absence of an increase in the underlying severity, does not constitute aggravation of the disability. Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a). Evidence of the veteran being asymptomatic on entry into service, with an exacerbation of symptoms during service, does not constitute evidence of aggravation. Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 320, 323 (1991). If the disorder becomes worse during service and then improves due to in-service treatment to the point that it was no more disabling than it was at entrance into service, the disorder has not been aggravated by service. Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529 (1996).

Congenital or developmental "defects" automatically rebut the presumption of soundness and are therefore considered to have pre-existed service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(c), 4.9. Defects are defined as "structural or inherent abnormalities or conditions which are more or less stationary in nature." VAOPGCPREC 82-90 (July 18, 1990). Service connection is generally precluded by regulation for such "defects," because they are not "diseases" or "injuries" within the meaning of applicable legislation. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(c), 4.9, 4.127; accord Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 174, 179 (2007).

VA's Office of General Counsel has distinguished between congenital or developmental defects, for which service connection is precluded by regulation, and congenital or hereditary diseases, for which service connection may be granted, if initially manifested in or aggravated by service. See VAOPGCPREC 82-90, VAOPGCPREC 67-90. The VA General Counsel draws on medical authorities and case law from other federal jurisdictions and concludes that a defect differs from a disease in that a defect is "more or less stationary in nature," while a disease is "capable of improving or deteriorating." See VAOPGCPREC 82-90 at para. 2.

As noted above, the presumption of soundness does not apply to congenital defects because such defects "are not diseases or injuries" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1111. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(c); see also Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 397 (2007); Terry, 340 F.3d at 1385-86 (holding that the presumption of soundness does not apply to congenital defects); Winn v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 510, 16 (1996) (holding that a non-disease or non-injury entity such as a congenital defect is "not the type of disease- or injury-related defect to which the presumption of soundness can apply"). However, a congenital defect can still be subject to superimposed disease or injury. VAOPGCPREC 82-90. If such superimposed disease or injury does occur, service connection may be warranted for the resulting disability. Id.

However, if it is determined during service that a veteran suffers from a congenital disease, as opposed to a defect, VA cannot simply assume that, because of its congenital nature, the disease must have pre-existed service. That is, the presumption of soundness still applies to congenital diseases that are not noted at entry. Quirin, 22 Vet. App. at 396-397. Since the presumption of soundness at entrance attaches, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the congenital disease pre-existed service. Monroe v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 513, 515 (1993). VA may not rely on a regulation as a substitute for the requirement that it rely on independent medical evidence. Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991). VA's Office of General Counsel has also confirmed that the existence of a congenital hereditary disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(c) does not always rebut the presumption of soundness, and that service connection may be granted for congenital hereditary diseases which either first manifest themselves during service or which pre-exist service and progressed at an abnormally high rate during service. See VAOPGCPREC 67-90; 55 Fed. Reg. 43,253 (1990).

In short, service connection is available for congenital diseases, but not defects, that are aggravated in service. Quirin, 22 Vet. App. at 394; Monroe v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 513, 515 (1993). In cases where the appellant seeks service connection for a congenital condition, the Board must indicate whether the condition is a disease or defect and discuss the presumption of soundness. Quirin, 22 Vet. App. at 394-397. It follows that in such cases where a congenital condition is at issue, a VA medical opinion may be needed to determine whether the condition is a disease or defect, whether the presumption of soundness has been rebutted, and if so, whether there was aggravation during service. Id. at 395.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Veteran's bilateral pes planus was noted upon entry as mild and asymptomatic. See STR - Exam - Entrance (Sept. 24, 2018, rec'd Apr. 5, 2022), at Page 11, Question No. 35.  The Board determines that there is no pre-decisional error in this finding, because this is sufficiently clear and unmistakable evidence of pre-existing bilateral pes planus.  Upon a VA examination of the feet, the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral pes planus, bilateral hallux valgus, and bilateral ankle tendinosis, with the latter two also being separately service connected. See C&P Exam (Apr. 21, 2022, rec'd June 9, 2022), at Pages 3-4 of 18, Section I; Rating Decision (Codesheet) (Mar. 29, 2024).  Finally, in the event that pes planus may result in any compensatory altered gait, the Veteran is also service connected for bilateral shin splints, bilateral knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, and right hip strain. See id.  

The only remaining questions are whether the Veteran's current bilateral pes planus has become more severe due to active duty discharge, and whether this aggravation is clearly and unmistakably limited to the natural progression of the disorder.  The Board notes that the record contains numerous medical opinions which must be considered and weighed. See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 69-70 (1993) (citing Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192-93 (1992)). See also Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-471 (1993) (stating that the probative value of medical evidence is based on the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician reaches; as is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the Board). When faced with conflicting medical opinions, the Board may favor one medical opinion over the other. See Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998), citing Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995). The Board will consider these opinions below.

In an August 2022 etiological opinion, the VA examiner determined that the Veteran's pes planus is clearly and unmistakably not more severe than the natural progression of the preexisting disability. See C&P Exam (Aug. 8, 2022, rec'd Aug. 11, 2022), at Page 3 of 5, Section V.  The examiner referenced specific service treatment records dated March 19, 2019; May 6, 2019; December 2020; and January 2021. Id.  The examiner however did not address the relevance or lack thereof of the following record, dated December 8, 2021 with the note being signed on January 13, 2022:

29 yo adult male with chronic bilateral leg pain. Had stress reaction on bone scan, followed by normal MRIs. Working diagnosis is pes planus with tibialis tendinopathy. Has tried conservative management with PT. Still with pain and flares. I believe he would be a good candidate for Sports Medicine. Please evaluate to consider injection options like PRP or prolotherapy. Evaluation and treat as indicated. Thank you.

See STR (Dec. 8, 2021, rec'd Nov. 19, 2022), at Page 74.  If the examiner's negative etiological opinion failed to consider this service treatment record, then the etiological opinion is predicated upon an incomplete picture of the progression, which is an inaccurate actual premise. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458 (1993) (medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).  The etiological opinion's probative value is accordingly diminished.

On July 14, 2023, the AOJ received the Veteran's private etiological opinions from the aforementioned Dr. M.S. See Correspondence (July 11, 2023, rec'd July 14, 2023).  In sum and substance, Dr. M.S. attributed the Veteran's increasingly severe pes planus to Army-issued boots with inadequate arch supports, and ultimately concluded that "based on the Veteran's account and relevant records, we can assume that his bilateral pes planus was more likely than not aggravated beyond normal progression by the footwear issued during service.  No foreseen material improvement will be maintained under ordinary conditions of work and life." Id. at Page 5 of 22.  An etiological opinion based wholly on accepting the Veteran's contentions as true would not be entitled to probative weight, see Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458 (1993) (medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value); Nieves-Rodriguez, supra; Stefl, supra, but the Board determines that there is sufficient medical documentation of the pes planus (as pre-existing active duty service, as progressing through active duty service, and being presently diagnosed), and the Veteran is competent to offer credible testimony about his medical history and how his painful flat feet affect his daily life.  

Ultimately, the Board determines that Dr. M.S.'s etiological opinion is entitled to moderate probative weight, but no matter how little probative weight it might be entitled to, the Board can still conclude that the Veteran's pre-existing pes planus has become more severe since active duty service, and that it is not clear and unmistakable that the aggravation is limited to natural progression of the disability.  Instead of remanding this claim to further develop it, the Board will instead simply determine that the evidence is at least evenly balanced to grant the claim as due to aggravation, so the Board must do just that instead.  The Board is prohibited from developing additional evidence for the purpose of obtaining evidence against a claimant's case. See Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305 (2003).  In other words, the Veteran's pes planus is noted on entry but also noted as becoming more severe throughout active duty service.  After resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that the Veteran's current bilateral pes planus is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) permanently worsened due to his tour of active duty service, and it is not clear and unmistakable that this worsening is limited to natural progression of the disorder.

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for bilateral pes planus, as preexisting but aggravated by active duty service, is warranted. The appeal is hereby GRANTED. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to increased ratings for right ankle tendinosis (currently rated 10 percent disabling effective October 12, 2022) is remanded.

2. Entitlement to increased ratings for left ankle tendinosis (currently rated 10 percent disabling effective October 12, 2022) is remanded.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.68, the Veteran cannot receive ratings at one body part in excess of the rating for an amputation at the elective level.  

A 60 percent rating is given for an above-the-knee amputation of the leg that does not impact the upper third (defined as one-third of the distance from the perineum to the knee joint, starting at the perineum).  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5164.  Meanwhile, a 40 percent rating is given for a leg amputation at a lower level, permitting prosthesis; or else, of the forefoot resulting in more than one half of metatarsal loss; or else, a 40 percent rating is otherwise awarded for loss of use of the foot.  Id. at DC 5165-67.  

The Veteran is service connected for a right hip disorder and bilateral knee disorders, but the Board cannot infer claims for the knees or any higher disability out of this remaining claim for increased ratings for the bilateral ankles.  As is pertinent to the Veteran's bilateral lower legs below the knees, the Veteran has a 10 percent rating for bilateral hallux valgus, a 10 percent rating for bilateral shin splints, service-connected aggravated bilateral pes planus, which has not yet been assigned an initial rating, and this 10 percent rating for a bilateral ankle disorder that remains on appeal.

If the Veteran's bilateral pes planus is assigned a 20 percent initial rating or higher, then the Veteran's legs below the knees (including the feet) would be rated 40 percent bilaterally, so the claim for higher ratings for the ankles would be dismissed as moot, for being violative of the Amputation Rule.  The ankles are inextricably intertwined with the outcome of bilateral pes planus, so adjudication must accordingly be deferred, and the only way to do so is to remand back to the AOJ.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (issues are "inextricably intertwined" when a decision on one issue would have a "significant impact" on a Veteran's claim for the second issue).  Meanwhile, the Board notes the AOJ's previous failure to consider Dr. M.S.'s positive statements of record as of July 2023.  Any attempt to adjudicate this claim now would risk being prejudicial to the Veteran's claim, in light of this pre-decisional error in violation of the duty to assist.

For these reasons, the Board cannot escape the conclusion that the claim for higher ratings for the bilateral ankle disorder must be remanded.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Assign the Veteran's initial rating and effective date for service connected bilateral pes planus, as pre-existing but aggravated by active duty service.

Readjudicate the Veteran's claim for higher ratings for the bilateral ankle disorder, currently rated 10 percent in each lower extremity effective October 12, 2022-the day after discharge.  All readjudication of the claim remaining on appeal must consider all favorable evidence of record, including but not limited to Dr. M.S.'s opinions that were associated with the claims file no later than July 2023.

The AOJ is reminded that if higher ratings are warranted for the bilateral ankles, then the Veteran's total disability picture cannot violate the Amputation Rule of 38 C.F.R. § 4.68.  Combined disabilities of the lower legs but below the knee cannot exceed 40 percent, while combined disabilities of the legs, above the knee, but still below the upper third of the thigh cannot exceed 60 percent. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5164-67.
