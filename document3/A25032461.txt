REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for a left shoulder disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 27, 1990, to March 27, 1995.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review (HLR) subsequent to the Notice of Disagreement in September 2024. The AOJ subsequently informed the Veteran that her HLR was invalid because there was already an appeal pending before the Board in a December 2024 notification. 

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for a left shoulder disability is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to an increased rating for a left shoulder disability is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the August 2024 rating decision on appeal.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) obtained an April 2024 examination report and August 2024 addendum opinion prior to the August 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, this examination report did not adequately consider all of the Veteran's symptomology associated with her left shoulder disability.

A review of the April 2024 VA examination indicates that the Veteran had suffered a left shoulder fracture shortly before the examination and was unable to be tested at the time. The examiner merely provided estimates of the Veteran's limitations. The Board finds that this is inadequate because the Veteran's most recent shoulder examination with full range of motion testing was from October 1997. VA's duty to assist a veteran includes the duty to conduct a thorough and contemporaneous examination so that the evaluation of the disability will be a fully informed one. See Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121, 124 (1991).

Under the circumstances, the Veteran should be afforded a new VA examination to determine the current severity of her left shoulder disability. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159; see also Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121, 124 (1991) (VA has a duty to provide the veteran with a thorough and contemporaneous medical examination); Weggenmann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 281 (1993) (VA has a duty to provide an examination when there is evidence that the disability has worsened since the previous examination).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of the service-connected left shoulder disability.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.  

In so doing, the examiner must test the Veteran's active motion, passive motion, and pain with weight-bearing and without weight-bearing.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

In so doing, the examiner must attempt to elicit information regarding the severity, frequency, and duration of any flare-ups, and the degree of functional loss during flare-ups.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement based on direct observation, the examiner should provide an estimate, if at all possible, of the additional impairment due to flare-ups based on the other evidence of record and the Veteran's statements.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the

record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
