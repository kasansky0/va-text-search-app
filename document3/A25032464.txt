ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is not in approximate balance but persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disorder in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), at any time during the pendency of his appeal, or recent to the filing of his claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1995 to July 1998.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed a claim for service connection for a right knee disability, citing a June 2010 rating decision as the appealed decision.  However, the June 2010 notification letter of a May 2010 rating decision is not eligible for an AMA appeal before the Board because the rating decision was issued prior to February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400.  The Veteran was required to appeal the May 2010 rating decision by following the rules of the legacy system, which included utilizing the legacy NOD form (VA Form 21-0958) and filing this form within a year of the May 2010 rating decision.  Therefore, the August 2024 AMA NOD (VA Form 10182) cannot be accepted as a valid appeal of the June 2010 rating decision which denied service connection for a right knee disability.

The Board notes that the AOJ requested the Veteran submit any relevant private treatment records or submit information with which VA can assist the Veteran in obtaining private treatment records.  The Veteran did not respond to the request nor submit the private treatment records requested.  The duty to assist is not a one-way street.  If a Veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining evidence.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991).  Thus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the duty to assist.  No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in development.  Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).

The standard set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) only permits constructive receipt of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records that not only existed prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, but also for which the claimant furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of those records. Thus, the Board's consideration of VHA records is limited to the same.  Here, the Board finds that attempts to obtain VA treatment records were consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) and the AMA framework.

38 C.F.R. § 3.103 provides that a Veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim.  The Board observes that notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing at the AOJ was not provided in this case.  In Bowen, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested hearing before the AOJ because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a hearing before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253 (2012). Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket. Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, or air service.  38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).

Service connection for PTSD requires the presence of three particular elements: (1) a current medical diagnosis of PTSD; (2) medical evidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and a claimed in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred.

With any claim for service connection, it is necessary for a current disability to be present. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

Significantly, to be considered a disability for VA purposes, a mental disorder must be diagnosed in conformance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Without a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder under the DSM-5, the requirements for service connection for a psychiatric disorder are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.125; Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F. 4th 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2022). 

The Veteran contends that he experiences PTSD related to an in-service event, injury or exposure, to include a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  See August 2023 compensation claim.  The Veteran did not submit a statement describing details of an in-service stressful incident, such as what incident occurred, or where or when the stressful event occurred.

Here, the Board finds that the evidence of record weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder in accordance with the DSM-5 at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.

The claims file does not include VA or private treatment records nor has the Veteran furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of any VA treatment records.

As noted above, service connection cannot be granted "in the absence of proof of a present disability." Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). The Board recognizes that the Veteran is competent to report his own observations regarding any behavioral changes after service. See Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010) (emphasizing that the Board "must consider lay evidence but may give it whatever weight it concludes the evidence is entitled to"). The Veteran, however, is not competent as a layperson to establish a diagnosis for PTSD or any psychiatric disorder based on his testimony and conjecture alone. Psychiatric disorders are complex and involve processes that go beyond what can be readily observed by a layperson. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F3d. 1372, 1376-77 and n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (recognizing that the competence of a layperson to offer evidence on a medical issue is limited to where doing so does not require reliance on specialized medical knowledge or expertise).

Further, the service treatment records do not contain any indication of symptoms, complaints, or treatment related to an acquired psychiatric disorder and the Veteran has not provided any details regarding an in-service stressful event which he believes led to the development of his acquired psychiatric disorder.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination in connection with this claim prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal. However, the Board finds that an examination was not required because as discussed above, the record does not contain competent lay or medical evidence of a current acquired psychiatric disability or persistent symptoms of a psychiatric disability. Therefore, as there is no competent evidence of a current disability, VA's duty to assist is not triggered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i)(A); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). 

In sum, the Veteran has not been diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disorder in accordance with the DSM-5 at any time during the pendency of the claim.  The law is clear that in claims for service connection for psychiatric disorders, a diagnosis under the DSM-5 is required to establish a current disability. Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F.4th 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2022).  Thus, the evidence is not in approximate balance but weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.  As such, service connection is denied.
