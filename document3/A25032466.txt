ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as secondary to service-connected right ankle calcaneal spur, and associated weight gain, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran has OSA that is at least as likely as not proximately related to his service-connected right ankle calcaneal spur, and associated weight gain.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for secondary service connection for OSA, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Air Force from March 1974 to August 1981.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), that as relevant here, denied service connection for OSA.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal may not be considered by the Board. 

38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. Here, the Veteran's attorney submitted a "Summary of Argument" with the July 2024, Notice of Disagreement. To the extent that the submission contains argument only referencing evidence of record, the Board may and has considered it in the following decision.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Secondary service connection for OSA

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Generally, to establish entitlement to service connection on a secondary basis, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) probative evidence establishing a link between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Here, the Veteran asserts service connection for OSA claiming the condition as secondary to his service-connected right ankle calcaneal spur, and associated weight gain. See July 2024 Notice of Disagreement and Summary of Argument.

The Veteran initially filed a claim seeking service connection for OSA in February 2023.

First addressing the matter of a current disability, the Board notes that the favorable findings noted in the September 2023 rating decision on appeal include that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability noting that VA examination dated in July 2023 confirms a diagnosis of OSA; and that the Veteran is service connected for right ankle calcaneal spur.

With respect to the diagnosed OSA and regarding secondary service connection, there is probative medical evidence of record dated in February 2023 (received by the VA, February 28, 2023), indicating a nexus between the Veteran's OSA and his service-connected right ankle calcaneal spur, with associated weight gain as an intermediate step. Specifically, a private licensed health care provider (PA-C), provided a positive nexus opinion indicating as follows: "...[that] it is at least as likely as not (a 50 % / 50 % probability) that the Veteran's ... Obstructive Sleep Apnea Condition with CPAP is secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by the weight gain and obesity from the service-connected Right Ankle Calcaneal Spur; and is at least as likely as not (a 50 % / 50 % probability) that without the veteran's weight gain and obesity his Obstructive Sleep Apnea would not have occurred."

The private medical opinion provides a detailed explanation and cites to relevant medical literature regarding musculoskeletal disability, weight gain, and OSA. The Veteran reported that his service-connected right ankle calcaneal spur results in an inability to exercise with associated weight gain and sleep disturbance. Notably, an August 2023 VA medical opinion (received September 20, 2023) regarding other service connected disability, noted that, "... residual injury to his ankle ... [and] pain associated with [] physical alignments as well as reduced [range of motion] ROM make it impossible for the veteran to engage in exercise and other physical activities such as household chores and addressing hygiene."

Notably, the February 2023 private opinion is not only informed by medical literature as referenced and discussed in detail in the opinion, but also by the private provider's familiarity with the Veteran's medical history and lay reports regarding his military service and experiences related to his service-connected conditions as detailed in the opinion. Given the medical literature discussed and explained in the opinion, the private provider's familiarity with the Veteran's military history, treatment, and lay reports, and the detailed explanation provided in the February 2023 report, the opinion is adequate. See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012). Accordingly, the Board finds the February 2023, private opinion to be of significant probative value as the private provider indicated reviewing all the Veteran's available medical records, service records, and treatment records, together with his expertise and the cited medical research explained therein. Such opinion, therefore, constitutes competent, probative evidence tending to support an award of secondary service connection for OSA on a secondary basis. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Wallin, 11 Vet. App. at 512.

While negative VA etiology opinions addressing the Veteran's OSA are part of the record, the July 2023 VA medical opinion and the August 2023 Addendum, do not adequately address the causation element of service connection, nor do either even specifically address the February 2023 private opinion of record. See Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74, 90-91 (2018) (holding that whether a service-connected condition caused or whether it aggravated a veteran's current disability are independent inquiries and an examiner's failure to treat these questions separately renders the opinion inadequate). The July 2023 examination focuses on whether the cause of the Veteran's OSA is his weight gain and makes a judgment that because other individuals with disability were able to maintain weight, the Veteran should have as well. Given the Veteran initially claimed that the OSA was related to his right ankle calcaneal spur, and associated weight gain, the July 2023 VA medical opinion and August 2023 VA Addendum do not sufficiently consider the connection between the Veteran's service-connected right ankle calcaneal spur, and weight gain as an intermediary step to his diagnosed OSA. Accordingly, the Board finds the July 2023 VA medical opinion and August 2023 VA addendum opinion, to be of minimal probative value.

Looking at the evidence as a whole and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the relevant, probative evidence of record tends to support a finding that the Veteran's current OSA is proximately due to his service-connected right ankle calcaneal spur, and associated weight gain on a causation basis. Thus, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that secondary service connection for OSA, is warranted, and the issue is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310(a); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.
