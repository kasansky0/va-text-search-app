ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of November 2, 2022, for a grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for aid and attendance and under 38 U.S.C. 1114, subsection (p) and 38 CFR 3.350(f)(3) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  A claim for an increased rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with panic attacks and insomnia disorder (previously rated as unspecified anxiety disorder) was received by VA on November 2, 2022; the Veteran continuously pursued an increased rating until the January 2024 rating decision that granted entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance and under 38 U.S.C. 1114, subsection (p) and 38 CFR 3.350(f)(3), effective March 16, 2023. 

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, he met the criteria for entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for aid and attendance from November 2, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of November 2, 2022, for a grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for aid and attendance and under 38 U.S.C. 1114, subsection (p) and 38 CFR 3.350(f)(3) has been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 3.400, 4.3.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United Stated Navy from February 2001 to August 2004.

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2024 decision that granted entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance and under 38 U.S.C. 1114, subsection (p) and 38 CFR 3.350(f)(3), effective March 16, 2023.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2024 decision.  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

The AMA Direct Review does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  As this is a Direct Review appeal under the AMA, the record closed as of the January 2024 rating decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Earlier Effective Date

The statutory and regulatory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation and DIC are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Generally, the effective date of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be on the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C.§ 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

For supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issues a notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).  Continuous pursuit of a claim or an issue can be achieved by timely and properly filing an appropriate review option, generally within one year of the rating decision.  If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, allowing the effective date to relate back to the date of receipt of the initial claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  However, supplemental claims received more than a year after notice of a decision do not maintain continuous pursuit and, accordingly, result in an effective date that will be no earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim instead of the initial claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).  

If the claim is received within 1 year after separation from service, the effective date based upon a grant of direct service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2).

Effective March 24, 2015, a change in regulation requires claims be filed on standard forms, eliminating constructive receipt of claims and informal claims. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  Instead of informal claims, the new regulation provides that a claimant may request an application for benefits, upon receipt of which, the Secretary shall notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the application form or form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  Non-standard narrative communications/submissions previously construed as informal claims will be considered a request for an application for benefits.  See Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57660, 57661 (Sept. 25, 2014) (where a claimant submits an informal claim, VA will deem it a request for an application for benefits).  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157.  See id. 

The amended regulation also allows a claimant to submit an "intent to file a claim," which operates similarly to the informal claim process.  Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b) provides that, if VA receives a complete application form within one year of the receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received.  There are three ways in which a claimant may submit an intent to file a claim: (i) by electronically initiating and saving a benefits application in a claims-submission tool with a VA web-based electronic claims application system; (ii) by submitting a written intent, signed and dated on the intent to file a claim form prescribed by the Secretary; or (iii) by orally communicating intent to designated VA personnel that is subsequently recorded in writing and documented in the claimant's records.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

1. Entitlement to an effective date of November 2, 2022, for a grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for aid and attendance and under 38 U.S.C. 1114, subsection (p) and 38 CFR 3.350(f)(3) is granted.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 16, 2023, for the grant of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance.  The Veteran contends that he continuously pursued an increased rating claim from November 2, 2022, and that he has met the criteria for SMC based on the need for aid and attendance from that date.  See Veteran's Correspondence (April 10, 2024).

As an initial matter, the Board notes that while the Veteran has other pending claims seeking entitlement to a higher level of SMC, the April 2024 VA Form 10182 certified for appeal only listed the issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 16, 2023, for the grant of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance.  Therefore, this is the only issue before the Board at this time.  

A claim for an increased rating for service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with panic attacks and insomnia disorder (previously rated as unspecified anxiety disorder) was received by VA on November 2, 2022.  A February 2023 rating decision increased the Veteran's PTSD rating to 100 percent, effective November 2, 2022.  That same month, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim, seeking entitlement to SMC.  A March 2023 rating decision granted SMC at the housebound rate, but denied SMC based on the need for aid and attendance.  That same month, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim seeking SMC based on a need for aid and attendance.  A July 2023 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim.  That same month, the Veteran submitted another supplemental claim.  A July 2023 rating decision granted SMC based on a need for aid and attendance from July 10, 2023.  In August 2023, the Veteran requested a higher-level view of the July 2023 rating decision, seeking an earlier effective date.  The RO denied entitlement to an earlier effective date in an October 2023 rating decision and that same month, the Veteran again requested a higher-level review.  A January 2024 rating decision granted entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance and under 38 U.S.C. 1114, subsection (p) and 38 CFR 3.350(f)(3), effective March 16, 2023.   

The Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim for an increased rating for his service-connected disabilities, to include entitlement to SMC, from the date of his November 2, 2022, claim.  The question is whether he met the criteria for SMC based on a need for aid and attendance prior to March 16, 2023.

SMC by reason of the need for regular aid and attendance of another person is payable if a veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, either: (1) has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, (2) has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of one hand and one foot, (3) is blind in both eyes, (4) is permanently bedridden, or (5) is with such significant disabilities/so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b).

In determining the need for regular aid and attendance of another person, several factors are for consideration.  These include: (1) the inability of the Veteran to dress or undress himself or to keep himself ordinarily clean and presentable, (2) the frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the Veteran's particular disability cannot be done without aid (this will not include the adjustment of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.), (3) the inability of the Veteran to feed himself through loss of coordination of her upper extremities or through extreme weakness, (4) the inability of the Veteran to attend to the wants of nature, (5) incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect him from hazards or dangers incident to him daily environment, and (6) the Veteran being bedridden.  Id. 

Granting SMC by reason of the need for regular aid and attendance of another person requires that at least one of the above disabling factors be met.  Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222 (1996).

As described above, it is not required that all of the disabling factors be found to exist before a favorable determination is made for regular need for aid and attendance of another person.  38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).  The particular personal functions that the Veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his condition as a whole.  Id.  It is only necessary that the evidence establish that the Veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there is a constant need.  Id. 

Because the record showed that the Veteran was still employed prior to March 2023, the RO determined he did not meet the criteria for SMC based on a need for aid and attendance.

While the Veteran was employed during the period from November 2022 to March 2023, a November 2022 VA examination found that the Veteran's PTSD is manifest by symptoms including the intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene.

In a letter received in February 2023, the Veteran's spouse, P.E., stated that the Veteran suffers from severe migraines lasting several days at a time.  These migraines are debilitating, causing vomiting, dizziness, and impaired vision.  During attacks, the Veteran requires assistance going to the bathroom, showering, dressing, brushing his teeth, preparing food, and managing his medications.  P.E. further stated that if she did not work from home, she would likely need to move the Veteran to a nursing home for daily care.  See Buddy/Lay Statement, February 2023.  

The Veteran reported in a February 2023 letter that his spouse ensures he takes the correct medications and dosages; assists him with using the restroom, showering, and dressing when he is dizzy from his migraines; and drives him to his medical appointments.  See Buddy/Lay Statement, February 2023.

A March 2023 Aid and Attendance examination noted that the Veteran needs assistance during his migraines because he is unable to walk safely due to dizziness and balance issues.  See Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance, March 2023.

Resolving reasonable doubt, the Board finds that the evidence establishes that during the period on appeal, the Veteran needed regular aid and attendance to assist him with activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene when suffering from his service-connected migraines, even if he did not require constant care.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the criteria for an effective date of November 2, 2022, for the grant of entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
