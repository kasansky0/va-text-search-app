CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

2. The claim for entitlement to basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, prior to March 19, 2021, is dismissed as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. Ch. 35; 38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299-300 (2006). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1986 to June 2006.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in January 2022 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 19, 2021, for the grant of service connection for migraine including migraine variants is dismissed.

In an October 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for migraine including migraine variants, with a 30 percent rating, effective March 19, 2021.  

In December 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the 30 percent disability rating awarded in the October 2021 decision. The Veteran did not appeal the assigned effective date for service connection.  

In January 2022, the AOJ considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2021 decision and issued the HLR decision on appeal.  The AOJ awarded a 50 percent rating, effective March 19, 2021, the effective date of service connection as the disability rating had been continuously pursued since the initial grant of service connection.   The Board notes that the Veteran did not continuously pursue an appeal of the effective date for the grant of service connection.  

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket and appealed the assigned effective date for the 50 percent rating for migraine headaches. As noted above, the January 2022 rating decision granted a 50 percent from the assigned date of service connection. Thus, the Board has interpreted the December 2022 VA Form 10182 has a request for an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection as the 50 percent rating has been assigned from the assigned date of service connection. This is the first time the Veteran has disagreed with the assigned effective date of the grant of service connection. 

The Court has held that, once there has been a relevant final decision on an issue, there cannot be a "freestanding claim" for an earlier effective date.  Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299-300 (2006). The Veteran must timely appeal the VA rating decision that assigned the effective date in question. If an untimely freestanding claim for an early effective date is filed, then the Court held in Rudd that dismissal by the Board is required due to the lack of a proper claim. The Court reasoned that to allow such an effective date claim to proceed would vitiate the rule of finality. Id. at 300. 

Accordingly, the Board has no legal authority to address the earlier effective date claim in this instance. A dismissal is appropriate from the Board, as opposed to a denial, even if the AOJ adjudicated the earlier effective date claim on the merits. Here, neither the Veteran nor his representative filed a motion to reverse or revise the earlier October 2021 rating decision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (2019). 

Thus, the Board dismisses the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 9, 2021 for the grant of service connection for migraine including migraine variants, as a matter of law. See also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994) (holding that, where the law is dispositive, the claim must be denied due to an absence of legal entitlement).

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 19, 2021, for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is dismissed. 

For the purposes of DEA benefits, basic eligibility exists if a Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, and if he has a permanent and total service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021. There are other avenues through which basic eligibility may be granted; however, they involve factors not applicable here, e.g., the death of a Veteran or if a Veteran is currently on active duty. Id. 

The Board has determined that an earlier effective date of March 19, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to a 50 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected migraines is dismissed.  Since eligibility for DEA benefits is predicated on a finding of a permanent and total disability in this case, the effective date of such eligibility is the date permanent and total disability was awarded.

Accordingly, an earlier effective date prior to March 19, 2021, for basic eligibility to DEA benefits is dismissed.
