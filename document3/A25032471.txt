ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected renal cell carcinoma is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected lower abdomen scar is denied.

Entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation based upon multiple, noncompensable, service-connected disabilities is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire period of appeal, the probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's service-connected renal cell carcinoma manifested as: recurrent symptomatic infections requiring 1-2 hospitalizations per year or suppressive drug therapy lasting six months or longer; stricture disease requiring periodic dilation every 2 to 3 months; daytime voiding interval between two and three hours or that the Veteran must awaken to void at least two times per night; a need to wear absorbent materials that require daily changing; or GFR worse than 60-89ML/min/ mL/min/1.73 m2 and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) ?30 mg/g for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.

2.  Throughout the period of appeal, the probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's lower abdominal scar was no more than 4.5 square centimeters and was not painful or unstable.

3. For the entire period of appeal, the Veteran's renal cell carcinoma and lower abdominal scar together were not of such a character as clearly to interfere with employability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected renal cell carcinoma have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7528. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for service-connected lower abdomen scar have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, DC 7802.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation based upon multiple, noncompensable, service-connected disabilities have not been met 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.324, 4.1, 4.3.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from August 1991 to February 1995.

In March 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review June 2023 and April 2023 rating decisions issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Board notes that the April 2023 rating decision granted service connection for renal cell carcinoma. The June 2023 rating decision reconsidered the initial evaluation of renal cell carcinoma along with the other issues on appeal. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by the application of the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Ch. I, Part 4.  Ratings for service-connected disabilities are determined by comparing the Veteran's symptoms with criteria listed in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based, as far as practically can be determined, on average impairment in earning capacity.  Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous."  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time.  Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings).  When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed.  Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509.

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. See Masors v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181 (1992). Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b). This benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is nearly equal but does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected renal cell carcinoma.

The Veteran contends that during the period of appeal, his service-connected renal cell carcinoma condition manifested as symptoms greater than those contemplated by his current non-compensable evaluation.

A.	Legal Criteria

The Veteran's service-connected renal cell carcinoma is assigned a noncompensable rating from August 10, 2022, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528.  See June 2023 Rating Decision - Codesheet.

Under DC 7528:

A 100 percent rating is warranted for malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system. The note following DC 7528 details that following the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure, the rating of 100 percent shall continue with a mandatory VA examination at the expiration of six months. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of § 3.105(e) of this chapter. If there has been no local recurrence or metastasis, kidney cancer residuals must be rated on voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.

Voiding dysfunction may be rated based on urine leakage, frequency, or obstructed voiding. For evaluations based on urine leakage, due to continual urine leakage, post-surgical urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, or stress incontinence, a 20 percent rating is warranted for voiding dysfunction requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed less than two times per day. A 40 percent rating is warranted for voiding dysfunction requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed two to four times per day. A 60 percent rating is warranted for voiding dysfunction requiring the use of an appliance or the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than four times per day. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

For evaluations based on urinary frequency, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for daytime voiding interval between two and three hours, or; awakening to void two times per night. A 20 percent evaluation is warranted for daytime urinary frequency intervals between one and two hours or nocturia three or four times a night. A 40 percent rating is warranted for daytime voiding interval less than one hour or awakening to void five or more times per night. Id.

For evaluations based on obstructed voiding, a 0 percent rating requires obstructive symptomatology with or without stricture disease requiring periodic dilatation 1 to 2 times per year. A 10 percent rating requires marked obstructive symptomatology (hesitancy, slow or weak stream, decreased force of stream) with any one or combination of the following: (1) post void residuals greater than 150 cc; (2) uroflowmetry; markedly diminished flow rate (less than 10 cc/second); (3) Recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction; (4) stricture disease requiring period dilation every two to three months. Urinary retention requiring intermittent or continuous catheterization warrants a 30 percent rating. Id.

For evaluations based on urinary tract infections, poor renal dysfunction is rated as renal dysfunction. A 10 percent evaluation is warranted for long-term drug therapy, one to two hospitalizations per year and/or requiring intermittent intensive management. A 30 percent rating is warranted for recurrent symptomatic infection requiring drainage and frequent hospitalization (greater than two times per year) and/or requiring continuous intensive management. Id.

B.	Facts

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination of his renal cell carcinoma symptoms in June 2023. See June 2023 C&P Exam. The examiner reviewed the claims file and examined the Veteran. Id at 1. The Veteran was afforded laboratory tests in connection with his VA examination. See June 2023 C&P Exam. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with right renal cell carcinoma, status post partial right nephrectomy. Id at 2. The examiner noted that the Veteran's nephrectomy surgery occurred in 2012. Id. At the time of the June 2023 examination, the Veteran reported no current symptoms. Id at 3. The Veteran reported that he was diagnosed with right renal cell carcinoma in 2012, underwent a partial nephrectomy the same year, and that his cancer is currently in remission. Id. The Veteran reported that he has routine tests done to monitor this condition. Id. No renal dysfunction was noted. Id. No infection was noted. Id at 5. The examiner assessed the Veteran's cancer as is remission since the Veteran's 2012 surgery. Id at 6. The examiner reviewed recent diagnostic tests including laboratory data and an October 2020 Computed Tomography (C/T) scan and noted that the Veteran's kidney functions were within normal limits and that only routine surveillance was recommended. Id at 7-8. No functional impact was observed by the examiner or described by the Veteran. Id at 8.

The Board has reviewed the Veteran's VA treatment records. These show that a cyst was observed on the Veteran's right kidney in August 2005. See March 2023 VAMC Other Output / Records at 447. In 2012 May 2012, the Veteran underwent surgery to remove a tumor from the right kidney. Id at 367, 287. Per VA treatment records, the Veteran has been asymptomatic since that time, with routine surveillance to watch for any recurrence. See, e.g., Id at 76. ("Again noted are low density lesions associated with the kidneys. No appreciable contrast enhancement. These lesions were seen on prior studies. Routine surveillance recommended.) The Veteran has occasionally reported discomfort in the area of the surgery. See, e.g., March 2023 CAPRI at 120 (reporting discomfort, requesting examination). However, the Veteran has not reported this discomfort specifically as pain; reported that the discomfort is persistent over time; or reported any particular way in which it impacts his social or occupational functioning. At the time of his June 2023 exam, as noted above, the Veteran reported no such discomfort.

There is no detailed lay statement or testimony of record. On his VA Form 10182, the Veteran stated that the reason for his appeal of the evaluation of his renal cell carcinoma is "disability evaluation, I check all the boxes for the PACT Act [...]." See March 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

C.	Analysis

The Board begins with acknowledgement of the Veteran's contention and concern as expressed on his VA Form 10182. Toxic exposure was conceded for the Veteran due to his service in an affected area, and his grant of service connection for renal cell carcinoma was made pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). As noted in his rating decision, the earliest possible effective date for a grant of entitlement under the PACT Act is the effective date of the PACT Act, August 10, 2022. 38 C.F.R. 3.114. Whether or not the Veteran's kidney condition was caused by his toxic exposure is not at issue in this appeal, as service connection has already been granted. At issue in the instant appeal is the severity of the Veteran's symptoms (that is, the function impact of this condition) from August 10, 2022, to present, as described by the medical and lay evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.10.

In this case, no evidence of record shows functional impairment reaching the threshold set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528, to warrant a compensable evaluation during the period of appeal described above. Specifically, the evidence of record shows that a malignant tumor was removed in 2012, and that since that time, the Veteran's renal cell carcinoma has been in remission. 

Because the evidence of record shows no renal dysfunction, the Veteran's residuals are evaluated as voiding dysfunction. Id. The Board notes that the medical evidence supports this determination. See June 2023 C&P Exam at 7 (GFR 63.5 in August 2016; 76.6 in November 2018; 81.4 in August 2020; 104 (normal) in May 2013.) The Board notes that these values do not support a compensable evaluation for renal dysfunction. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

Applying the rating criteria for voiding dysfunction, the Board notes that there is no evidence of record that the Veteran experiences recurrent symptomatic infections requiring 1-2 hospitalizations per year or suppressive drug therapy lasting six months or longer. There is no evidence of record that the Veteran experiences stricture disease requiring periodic dilation every 2 to 3 months. There is no evidence of record that Veteran has a daytime voiding interval between two and three hours or that the Veteran must awaken to void at least two times per night. Finally, there is no evidence of record that the Veteran must wear absorbent materials that require daily changing.

The Board assigns high probative weight to the June 2023 VA examination, which is supported by the Veteran's treatment records and is not contradicted by any other evidence of record. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. At 304 (2008) ("It is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion ... that contributes probative value to a medical opinion.")

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's service-connected renal cell carcinoma manifested as symptoms severe enough to warrant a compensable evaluation at any time during the period of appeal. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim must be denied. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

In closing, the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran in that it is clear from the evidence of record that prior to the effective date of the PACT Act the Veteran's renal cell carcinoma manifested with more severe symptoms; however, the Board may not deviate from the rules concerning the award of monetary benefits under applicable law. Noting that service connection for renal cell carcinoma has been established and that the Veteran is receiving routine monitoring for his renal cell carcinoma, should the Veteran's diagnosis or symptoms change or become more severe, the Veteran is encouraged to submit a supplemental claim or a claim for an increased rating.

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected lower abdomen scar.

The Veteran contends that during the period of appeal, his service-connected lower abdomen scar manifested as symptoms more severe than those contemplated by his non-compensable evaluation.

A.	Legal Criteria

The Veteran's service-connected lower abdomen scar is assigned a noncompensable rating from April 27, 2022, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802.

Under DC 7802:

A scar at a location other than the head, face, or neck that is superficial, with no underlying tissue damage, would have to have an area exceeding 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) to warrant a compensable, 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802. A superficial scar is one that is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802, Note (1).

Pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7805, disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804 are to be rated under an appropriate diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805.

B.	Facts and Analysis

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination of his lower abdominal scar in June 2023. See June 2023 C&P Exam. The examiner reviewed the claims file and examined the Veteran. Id at 1. The examiner noted one scar on the right side of the Veteran's lower abdomen. Id at 2. Id. The scar measured 22.5cm long by 0.2cm wide (4.5 square centimeters). Id at 6. The scar was not noted as tender, unstable, or with underlying soft tissue damage. Id. The examiner noted no functional limitations created by the scar. Id at 11. No pain was noted from the scar. Id at 2.

The Board has reviewed the Veterans' VA treatment records and finds no contradictory evidence regarding the Veteran's lower abdominal scar. See generally March 2023 VAMC Other Output / Reports (containing no specific discussion of problems concerning lower abdominal scar). The Board therefore finds the June 2023 examination adequate for rating purposes and assigns it high probative weight. See Nieves-Rodriguez, supra.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's lower abdominal scar did not exceed 144 square inches at any time during the period of appeal. The Board further notes that the probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's lower abdominal scar was painful or unstable or that it affected underlying soft tissue at any time during the period of appeal. The Board has considered evaluation under diagnostic codes 7801, 7802, 7804, and 7805 but finds that these criteria are not applicable under the facts of this case.

Thus, the weight of the competent and probative evidence does not support entitlement to a compensable evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected lower abdominal scar. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is denied. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

2. Entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation based upon multiple, noncompensable, service-connected disabilities is denied.

The Veteran contends that his service-connected renal cell carcinoma and lower abdominal scar together are of such a character as warrant entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation based upon multiple, noncompensable service-connected disabilities.

A.	Legal Criteria

Whenever a Veteran is suffering from two or more separate permanent service-connected disabilities of such character as clearly to interfere with normal employability, even though none of the disabilities may be of compensable degree under the 1945 Schedule for Rating Disabilities, the rating agency is authorized to apply a 10-percent rating, but not in combination with any other rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.324.

Here, the Veteran has two noncompensable service-connected disabilities: renal cell carcinoma and a lower abdominal scar. See June 2023 Rating Decision - Codesheet. The Veteran was afforded a VA examination of his renal cell carcinoma in June 2023. See supra Issue 1 (discussion of June 2023 C&P Exam). As noted above, the examiner found no functional impairment associated with this condition and the Veteran did not offer a lay statement describing such impairment. The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination of his lower abdominal scar in June 2023. See supra Issue 2 (discussion of June 2023 C&P Exam). No specific functional impairment was found by the examiner, nor did the Veteran describe any such functional impairment.

A review of the Veteran's VA medical records references both of these conditions but makes no clear statement (or even suggestion) as to their current impact on the Veteran's employability. See generally March 2023 VAMC Other Output / Reports. The Board further notes that the Veteran has provided no statement or testimony of any kind as to how these noncompensable conditions interfere with ordinary employment either individually or together.

Thus, the record contains no evidence that these conditions clearly interfere with ordinary employment. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.324, 4.1, 4.3. No duty-to-assist error occurred because the Veteran has had adequate VA examinations for these conditions.

Based on the above, the Board finds that entitlement to a 10 percent rating based upon multiple, noncompensable service-connected disabilities is not warranted. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a 10 percent rating based upon multiple, noncompensable service-connected disabilities is denied. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
