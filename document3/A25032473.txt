ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for anxiety is denied.

The appeal seeking readjudication of the claim of service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not have an anxiety disorder that is separate from his service-connected PTSD.

2. The Veteran attempted to appeal a March 2024 rating action on the matter of whether new and relevant evidence was submitted to readjudicate service connection for sleep apnea.  That rating action was subject to higher level review at his election, which resulted in the conversion of his claim back to a supplemental claim, and making his appeal to the Board an impermissible concurrent election. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for anxiety have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 3.2501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty for training from July 2013 to December 2013.  He served in the National Guard.

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea most recently addressed in a February 2024 rating decision. In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received. Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal.

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the March 2024 supplemental claim rating decision. In July 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which found a duty to assist error deferring the claim and denied the issue of service connection for anxiety on the first instance. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal, which was subject to higher-level review, regarding the issue of new and relevant evidence for sleep apnea. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. Regarding the issue of service connection for anxiety, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, are subject to presumptive service connection if it manifests to a compensable degree within one year from separation from service even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

To establish service connection under this provision, there must be evidence of a chronic disease shown as such in service (or within an applicable presumptive period under C.F.R. § 3.307) and subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) relating to continuity of symptomatology, however, can be applied only in cases involving those conditions explicitly enumerated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

When there is an approximate balance in the evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, reasonable doubt will be resolved in each such issue in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. An appellant need only demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence in order to prevail. To deny a claim on its merits, the preponderance of the evidence must be against the claim. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).

1. Entitlement to service connection for anxiety 

The Veteran contends that his anxiety is etiologically related to service. In the alternate, the Veteran contends that his anxiety was caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD. 

The Veteran was active duty to assist in search and rescue efforts following Hurricane Harvey. His service treatment records were silent for a diagnosis of anxiety. 

Post-service VA treatment records demonstrated that the Veteran was seeking treatment for mental health symptoms, including anxiety. An August 2023 mental health diagnostic study attributed symptoms to generalized anxiety disorder. 

During a November 2023 VA examination for PTSD, the examiner stated that the Veteran's only mental health diagnosis was PTSD. Included in the symptoms attributed to the Veteran's PTSD, the examiner listed anxiety. 

Initially, the Board notes that in order to be successful on a claim for service connection, either on a direct or secondary basis, the Veteran must possess a current disability. Here, the record is devoid of any documented mental health diagnosis other than PTSD. However, the Board further notes that the Veteran has expressed and described symptoms related to his PTSD, which included anxiety. 

However, a February 2024 rating decision granted service connection with a disability rating of 50 percent based on anxiety, amongst other symptoms.  Evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided, as is the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261 (1994); Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225 (1993). The rationale behind this "rule against pyramiding" is that a claimant should not be compensated twice for the same symptomatology as "such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment of his earning capacity." Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993).

The Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms are compensated in his current 50 percent rating for PTSD. Assigning another rating based on the same symptoms that already accounted for would be tantamount to pyramiding. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. Therefore, the Board finds that service connection for anxiety is not warranted.

New and Relevant Evidence

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 U.S.C. § 5108. New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers. Relevant evidence means evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101.

2. Sleep apnea 

In a February 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for sleep apnea.  In March 2024, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim seeking service connection for sleep apnea.

In a March 2024 rating action, the AOJ determined that new and relevant evidence had not been submitted to readjudicate the claim seeking service connection for sleep apnea.  Later in March 2024 the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996, seeking higher level review of the March 2024 rating decision as to sleep apnea.  

In a July 2024 rating action, the higher level review determined that a pre-decisional duty to assist error was present as to the sleep apnea claim, and converted the claim back to a supplemental claim; this claim was eventually adjudicated in October 2024.  On his July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran listed the issue of sleep apnea as the matter to be appealed to the Board, and identified both the March 2024 and July 2024 rating actions as the actions appealed.

Turning first to the July 2024 rating action, as to the sleep apnea claim, that matter could not be appealed to the Board as the rating action came to no appealable decision; the rating action was merely notice to the Veteran that the sleep apnea claim was being converted back to a supplemental claim.  That is not an appealable decision.

As to the March 2024 rating action, given that the higher level review did not result in a decision, but rather conversion back to a supplemental claim, the claim leading to the March 2024 rating action remained pending.  Thus, this supplemental claim was pending when the Veteran filed the July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

Under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), a claimant may generally seek one of three available administrative review options by filing the appropriate form following an AOJ decision. Those three review options are: (1) a Higher-Level Review request, (2) Supplemental Claim, or (3) Board appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

However, under the AMA, concurrent election is prohibited, meaning that once a Veteran has filed for review under one lane (i.e., higher-level review, supplemental claim, Board review), he cannot seek review under a different lane while adjudication is pending in the previously selected lane. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

Recently, the Court emphasized VA's prohibition against concurrent election, holding that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option." Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 14 (2023). The Court's holding in Terry was expressly predicated on finding that multiple review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A). Id. at 4. Accordingly, the Court's holding in Terry makes clear that only one review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues, due to the prohibition against concurrent election. Id. at 14.

Here, the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea must be dismissed as the Veteran selected improper concurrent election of multiple review options.

To that end, the Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182 was an improper concurrent election as the Veteran already had a supplemental claim pending before the AOJ as a result of the higher level review conducted earlier in July 2024.  

The procedural defect of an improper concurrent election warrants dismissal of the claims.  See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).  The appeal as to the sleep apnea claim is dismissed.
