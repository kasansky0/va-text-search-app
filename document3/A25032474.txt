FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent evidence of record establishes that the Veteran's current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss is due to his noise exposure in service.

2. The competent evidence of record establishes that the Veteran's current diagnosis of tinnitus was caused by his now service-connected bilateral hearing loss disability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, secondary to service-connected bilateral hearing loss disability on a causation basis, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1969 to October 1973.

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of two February 2021 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In a June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the AOJ issued the respective February 2021 rating decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the respective rating decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As to the claim for service connection for prostate cancer remanded herein for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

For VA compensation purposes, hearing impairment is considered a disability when: (1) the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels (dB) or greater; (2) the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 or 4000 Hz are 26 dB or greater; or (3) the speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for certain chronic diseases, to include organic diseases of the nervous system (such as sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus), if there is competent and credible evidence demonstrating that: (1) the chronic disease was shown as such in service or within the one year presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3) and the same chronic disease manifests at any later date, however remote, unless it is clearly attributable to intercurrent causes; (2) it manifested to a compensable degree within one year presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3); or (3) if the condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, continuity of symptomatology after discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a), 3.309(a); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Further, service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is caused or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires competent and credible evidence demonstrating (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a), (b); see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

A lay person is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by their senses; however, usually, they are not competent to prove a matter requiring medical expertise. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability.

The Veteran contends that his current bilateral hearing loss disability is due to noise exposure during service. See, e.g., March 2020 VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application.

In the February 2021 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a bilateral hearing loss disability and hazardous noise exposure during service due to his military occupational specialty (MOS) of jet engine mechanic. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). No clear and unmistakable error has been shown by the evidence of record as to these findings; therefore, the Board is bound by these favorable findings. Id. Thus, the current disability and in-service incurrence elements of this claim have been met. As such, the Board's analysis will focus on whether the Veteran's diagnosed bilateral hearing loss disability was caused by or is otherwise related to his in-service noise exposure.

In June 2011, the Veteran underwent a VA examination. The examiner noted four audiograms from the Veteran's entrance into service to his exit, and that all audiograms indicated normal hearing bilaterally. The examiner also noted the Veteran's report that he has had difficulty hearing for the past 15-20 years, as well as his career as a police officer for 30 years prior. The examiner then concluded that, due to the above information, the Veteran's hearing loss was not related to noise exposure during service.

A September 2015 VA treatment record notes noise exposure during service as an aircraft mechanic, as well as noise exposure during the Veteran's career in law enforcement with the firing line. The treatment record further notes that ear protection was used during the Veteran's law enforcement career.

In October 2017, the Veteran submitted a private nexus opinion from Dr. R.P.Q., an otolaryngologist, who performed audiometric testing of the Veteran in February 2017. Dr. R.P.Q. noted the Veteran's MOS as a jet engine mechanic from 1969 to 1973 as well as his statement of daily noise exposure without the use of hearing protection. Dr. R.P.Q. also noted that the Veteran has mild sloping to severe sensorineural hearing loss. The Dr. R.P.Q. stated that in his medical opinion, the Veteran's hearing loss has a pattern consistent with noise induced hearing loss, and his years of noise exposure in service more likely than not contributed to his permanent hearing impairment. In the February 2017 treatment record accompanying the opinion, Dr. R.P.Q. documents the Veteran's complaint of hearing loss for more than 20 years and states that the Veteran's hearing loss was aggravated by the Veteran's time as a jet engine mechanic in service.

In January 2018, the Veteran underwent a VA examination. The examiner noted the Veteran had an MOS with a high probability for hazardous noise exposure. The examiner noted that the Veteran's file did not contain a separation audiogram, and therefore, hearing loss during military service could not be ruled out. Therefore, the examiner concluded that hearing loss is at least as likely as not caused by the Veteran's service. 

In February 2018, the AOJ sought a clarifying opinion due to the factual inaccuracy in the January 2018 opinion that the Veteran's file did not contain a separation audiogram. The examiner opined that hearing loss and tinnitus due to noise exposure is expected to occur near and at the time of the noise exposure. The examiner acknowledged that the Veteran's MOS is highly probable of noise exposure; however, the examiner opined that the current objective medical evidence does not support that his current hearing loss occurred within and during his separation from service. Therefore, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's hearing loss is less likely than not related to his in-service noise exposure. 

In February 2021, the Veteran underwent another VA examination. The examiner opined that although the Veteran's MOS had a high probability for noise exposure and high levels of military noise are conceded, both entrance and separation audiograms showed normal hearing with no evidence of significant threshold shift. Current research does not support late-onset noise-induced hearing loss. Therefore, the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's hearing loss was caused by military noise exposure.

While the Board notes that audiograms during service show normal hearing, a February 1973 separation examination notes the Veteran's complaint of hearing loss. A July 1973 hospital admission note documents that the Veteran's hearing was down slightly, probably due to exposure to jet noise. Furthermore, in a December 2020 correspondence, the Veteran also stated that he began noticing that his hearing was not good even in his early years, although when he contacted VA and underwent a hearing examination, the test did not find anything wrong. He also stated that in service, he was provided with hearing protection, but was not required to wear it, and the protection was difficult to wear when working on jet aircraft. He further stated that after service, he was required to wear hearing protection anytime he was at firearm training on the range. See December 2020 correspondence.

The June 2011, February 2018, and February 2021 VA examiners only noted audiograms during service, but did not take these reports of diminished hearing from the Veteran into consideration or explain why his reports of hearing loss during service were not credible. Thus, the Board finds the June 2011, February 2018, and February 2021 VA medical opinions to be inadequate. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (noting that the probative value of a medical opinion derives from the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion). 

Considering the Veteran's service treatment records documenting complaints of hearing impairment and the October 2017 positive private nexus opinion from Dr. R.P.Q., the Board finds that the evidence of record demonstrates a nexus between the Veteran's noise exposure in service and his current bilateral hearing loss disability. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021) (en banc). Thus, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends that his tinnitus is due to noise exposure in service. See October 2017 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim; February 2020 Correspondence. 

In the February 2021 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). No clear and unmistakable error has been shown by the evidence of record as to this finding; therefore, the Board is bound by this finding. Id. 

Upon consideration of the Board's grant of service connection above for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability and the evidence of record as discussed below, the Board will consider entitlement to service connection on a secondary basis due his now service-connected bilateral hearing loss disability. 

In that regard, in January 2018, February 2018, February 2021 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was at least as likely as not a symptom associated with the hearing loss. In other words, that his tinnitus was caused by his bilateral hearing loss disability. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively establishes that the Veteran's current diagnosis of tinnitus was caused by his service-connected bilateral hearing loss. See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82. For that reason, service connection for tinnitus, secondary to service-connected bilateral hearing loss on a causation basis, is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The issue of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer.

The Veteran contends that his prostate cancer is due to his service, to include exposure to jet fuel during service. See December 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

In the February 2021 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of prostate cancer. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). No clear and unmistakable error has been shown by the evidence of record as to that finding; therefore, the Board is bound by that finding. Id. 

In February 2021, the Veteran underwent a VA examination. The examiner noted a diagnosis of prostate cancer in 2011 and a prostatectomy in 2012. The examiner noted the Veteran's family history of prostate cancer, to include his father's death due to prostate cancer and his brother's diagnosis of prostate cancer. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's prostate cancer was less likely than not due to jet fuel exposure in service because no studies were located regarding the reproductive effects in humans after inhalation exposure to JP-4. However, the examiner referenced a study performed on rats and mice, in which chronic exposure did not adversely affect the testis in rats, but did show atrophy in mice 12 months after. The examiner further opined that VA urology notes indicate the Veteran's family history of prostate cancer. 

In a January 2021 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran also stated that he believes his prostate cancer is due to his exposure to JP-4 in service because no one else in his family has it. Thus, there is evidence in the claims file which contradicts the basis for the examiner's opinion. The examiner did not take this into account or explain why they were discounting the Veteran's statement. Thus, the Board finds this opinion inadequate. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 301 (noting that the probative value of a medical opinion derives from the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion).

Remand by the Board in the AMA is proper for correction of duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors). 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The January 2021 Statement in Support of Claim and the February 2021 medical opinion were before the AOJ when it issued its February 2021 rating decision. Thus, remand is necessary to correct this duty to assist error.

As another matter, during the pendency of this appeal, the PACT Act was enacted. Under the PACT Act, if a veteran submits a claim for service connection with evidence of a disability and of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), then VA shall obtain a medical opinion as to whether there is a nexus between the disability and the TERA. Pub. L. No. 117-168; 38 U.S.C. § 1168. Further, it provides that when rendering a medical opinion, the medical professional must consider the veteran's total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs.

In this instant, a November 2024 VA TERA Memorandum notes the Veteran's exposure to jet fuel, anti-corrosive agents, and other petrochemicals such as aliphatic naphtha, due to his duties as a jet engine mechanic. A review of the Veteran's DD Form 214 confirms that his MOS was as a jet engine mechanic. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a VA medical opinion compliant with the PACT Act is also required. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion from an examiner to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's prostate cancer.

(Continued on the next page)

?

In rendering an opinion, the examiner should opine as to whether the Veteran's current diagnosis of prostate cancer was incurred in or is otherwise caused by his active service, to include his conceded participation in a TERA, and explain why or why not.

In doing so, the examiner must address the Veteran's conceded participation in a TERA due to his exposure to jet fuel, anti-corrosive agents, and other petrochemicals such as aliphatic naphtha due to his MOS as a jet engine mechanic and the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA.
