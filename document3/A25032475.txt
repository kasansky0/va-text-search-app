ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left knee strain is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a low back disability, to include lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's left knee strain began during service. 

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, low back disability began during service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left knee strain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a low back disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from February 1992 to February 1996.

This matter is on appeal to the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) from a May 2023 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is also the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In January 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2021 decision. In February 2022, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error in not having sought records identified by the Veteran. The AOJ returned the HLR request to the supplemental claim lane, fulfilled the duty to assist and then readjudicated the claim. In May 2023, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the two prior February 2021 and February 2022 decisions and any additional evidence that may have been submitted prior to the May 2023 rating decision.

In the June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement or NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 rating decision.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303. To establish service connection for a disability, the Veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the present disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

VA must consider all the evidence of record and its relative weight. If the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.?38 U.S.C. § 5107?(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.102. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

Service connection for left knee strain 

The Veteran contends that he injured his knee during service training in 1992, when he jumped over water and his left foot sunk and got trapped in wet sand causing a strain. See October 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ. He asserts that since service, his knee conditioned has worsened, with daily pain and weekly flare ups. See November 2020 VA examination. 

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of left knee strain and service treatment records (STRs) show he was treated during service for an injury to his left knee. See February 2021 VA examination and May 1995 STRs. Thus, the first two elements of service connection have been met. 

Regarding the third element of a nexus between the in-service injury and the current disability, the Board finds the evidence of record does not demonstrate that they are causally related.

In May 1995, during service, the Veteran sought treatment for left knee pain. The treatment record indicates the Veteran had multiple superficial abrasions to the left knee, which were cleaned and bandaged. See May 1995 STRs. Otherwise, the record is silent for knees until the October 1995 separation examination. There, the Veteran endorsed swollen or painful joints generally and noted right knee pain when it is cold. In the physician's summary section, the examiner noted that the right knee pain was probably due to overuse/chondromalacia. See October 1995 separation examination. 

Post-service, in October 2013, the Veteran sought private medical treatment for his left knee and was diagnosed with left knee strain. See December 2020 VA examination.

In November 2020, the Veteran underwent a VA examination to assess his left knee. During the examination, the Veteran reported daily clicking and pain when running or squatting, and if he walks too much, moderate to severe flaring lasting several hours. The examiner noted evidence of pain on range of motion testing and diagnosed left knee strain. November 2020 VA examination. Regarding the nexus between the in-service 1995 and current 2020 left knee conditions, the examiner opined that the left knee lacerations the Veteran sustained during service less likely than not caused the current left knee strain. As rationale, the examiner stated that superficial abrasions are not known to cause conditions affecting the soft tissues supporting the knee, such as the veteran's left knee strain. Id.

In December 2020, the Veteran underwent another VA examination for his left knee. Regarding nexus, the examiner likewise found the in-service injury less likely than not caused the current left knee strain diagnosed in 2013 and 2020. As rationale, the examiner noted the lack of findings consistent with a chronic condition of the left knee other than superficial abrasions in 1995, and a lack of chronicity after service. December 2020 VA examination.

The Board finds the examiners' opinions collectively probative of the lack of a nexus between the Veteran's in-service knee injury and currently diagnosed left knee disability. Each examination was based on record review, chronology of symptom onset, and treatment history, and provided explanations with clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran believes his left knee strain was caused during service. In particular, the Board has considered the Veteran's assertion that the notation on his separation examination mistakenly identified the right knee rather than the left. Accepting that explanation as plausible in the abstract, here, the other evidence of record weighs decisively against that interpretation. While the Veteran is competent to report on his symptoms, the causal connection of his symptoms to prior events is medically complex and outside his competence, where the record does not show the Veteran has the medical training to make such a determination. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In summary, the most probative evidence of record does not support a finding of a nexus between the Veteran's in-service left knee injury and current left knee disability. Considering the above, the persuasive evidence is against the claim and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply. The claim for entitlement to service connection for a left knee strain therefore must be denied.

Service connection for lumbosacral strain 

The Veteran contends that he injured his lower back during service in 1993 while working as a motor transport operator. Specifically, he was lifting heavy equipment and large tires and jumping off of five-ton trucks and felt sudden back pain. He was treated for the injury and he asserts that since service, he has needed to seek treatment for the same lower back symptoms. See October 2020 VA Form 526EZ and November 2020 VA examination. 

The Veteran has various back diagnoses, to include lumbosacral strain with IVDS, and the onset of the disability occurred in service, when the Veteran was treated for a back injury. See February 2021 VA examination and November 1999 service treatment records. Thus, the first two elements of service connection have been met.

The Board further finds, as discussed below, that the evidence of record demonstrates that his disability is causally related to his injury in service.

The Veteran's treatment records confirm that the Veteran injured his lower back during service in 1993. The injury was diagnosed as mechanical lumbar thoracic strain and was treated with physical therapy and motrin for pain. See July 1993 STRs. 

Post-service, the Veteran reports that in 2004 while at work, he again hurt his back and in 2005 the condition worsened and that over time, he has turned to chiropractic treatment, physical therapy, an epidural shot, and prescription medications for chronic daily pain. See November 2020 and February 2021 VA examinations. Medical records show 2013 treatment by a private physician for chronic lower back pain and again in 2019 when sciatica symptoms began. A 2019 MRI revealed a disc bulge at L5-S1, diagnosed as intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS). Id.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2020. The examiner found evidence of lumbosacral strain, IVDS and radiculopathy. Regarding a causal nexus, the examiner opined that the Veteran's current lumbosacral strain was at least as likely as not incurred during service. As rationale, the examiner noted the Veteran's medical history and stated that medical literature shows 85 percent of lifetime re-occurrence of "mechanical back pain" such as lumbar strain. Regarding the IVDS with radiculopathy, the examiner opined that because this was not demonstrated in the Veteran's STRs, it is less likely than not that it was incurred in service.

The Board finds the November 2020 VA examination probative regarding the nexus for lumbosacral sprain, as it is based on the Veteran's medical history and supported by a rationale that explains the conclusions. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295 (2008). 

However, the Board finds the examiner's negative nexus opinion for the diagnosed IVDS to be conclusory and based on an inadequate rationale. The examiner cites as a principal basis, the lack of in-service medical evidence of that condition. However, the examiner did not consider the limited scope of the in-service diagnosis of "lumbar strain, which was based only on a physical examination without imaging. The medical literature cited by the examiner explains that "lumbar strain" is used as a diagnostic short-cut where proper diagnostic methods are lacking and that a "mechanical back" pathology may involve any of the structures, including invertebral discs, or nerves, and could implicate stenosis, degenerative disk disease or other pathologies. Thus, the absence of more precise medical evidence does not mean the Veteran had not incurred the injuries more specifically diagnosed and therefore the Board finds this opinion not probative. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007).

The Board has also considered the December 2020 VA examination of the Veteran's back disability, focused in particular on the disc bulge diagnosed as IVDS. The examiner found it was less likely than not caused by the in-service injury and, like the November 2020 examination, relied on the absence of evidence of IVDS in the Veteran's service treatment records as rationale. The examiner also cited the large time gap between service and post-service treatment and the possibility that Veteran's 2004 work injury could have been an intervening cause of the IVDS rather than the in-service back injury. The Board finds the rationale to be based more on speculation than on facts and as noted above, the absence of medical proof cannot alone sustain the negative nexus opinion. Id. 

The Board finds the medical evidence of record to be in approximate balance on whether the Veteran's in-service back injury caused his current back disability. Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's low back disability is causally related to service and service connection is warranted.
