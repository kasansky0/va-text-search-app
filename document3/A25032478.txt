ORDER

An annual clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for a back brace is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's back brace, worn to treat a service-connected disability, for the 2020 calendar year, tended to wear out or tear his clothing.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for a back brace are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1162, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.810.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1997 to January 1998 and March 2003 to June 2004.  This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 24, 2021, decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration.  

In September 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 2020 decision.  On February 24, 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 2020 decision.

In his April 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2020 AOJ decision that was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Clothing Allowance

The law provides for payment of an annual clothing allowance for each veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including a wheelchair) which VA determines tends to wear out or tear the clothing of the veteran, or uses medication which a physician has prescribed for a skin condition which is due to a service-connected disability and VA determines causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments.  38 U.S.C. § 1162.

The implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.810, provides, in pertinent part, that an annual clothing allowance may be granted when the Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a veteran, because of a service-connected disability or disabilities, wears or uses one qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) which tends to wear or tear clothing, or that a veteran uses medication prescribed by a physician for one skin condition, which is due to a service-connected disability, that causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1)(ii).

An annual clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for a back brace is granted.

In his May 2020 application for a clothing allowance for a back brace, the Veteran stated that his back brace was issued to him in July 2014 from the Hangar Clinic Orthotic and Prosthetic Solutions.  On the application form, the Veteran provided signed certification that he regularly wore or used his back brace, and that the back brace tended to wear out or tear his clothing.  In 2020, the Veteran had the service-connected disability of lumbar strain with degenerative disc disease.  

As reflected in its original August 2020 decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim on the basis that it was "unable to validate continued use of the back brace claimed" after reviewing medical and prosthetic records.  

The Veteran, in a statement originally submitted in November 2020, argued that, as the last six months of his medical appointments had been by telephone due to COVID-19 restrictions, his doctors had not been able to see him wearing his back brace and had not asked him if he was wearing it; therefore, his records would not reflect anything about his brace, even though he wore it daily as he suffered a great deal with back pain and wearing the brace allowed him to engage in activities that he would otherwise not be able to engage in.  He also argued that he did not visit the prosthetics department for any routine adjustments to his brace, as VA sent him to the Hangar Clinic to get a specially fit device, and he was trained there on how to adjust the cables of the brace, which he did regularly.  

There are few medical records associated with the file.  What VA medical records there are reflect that the Veteran was in fact issued his back brace in July 2014 from the Hangar Clinic and that, on September 2014 VA examination, the Veteran was noted to have constant use of a back brace for his service-connected back condition.  VA clothing allowance awards records further reflect that the Veteran had received a clothing allowance for every year between 2014 and 2019, until he was denied one in 2020.  

The Board finds the evidence as to whether the Veteran's back brace, during 2020, tended to wear out or tear his clothing to be at least in approximate balance.  The Veteran certified that it did in his August 2020 application for benefits, as well as that he regularly wore or used his back brace, and there is no evidence directly contradicting this statement.  Also, while contemporaneous VA treatment records are not available for review, the Veteran's arguments that his back brace had not been noted on medical evaluation throughout 2020 because his appointments had all been over the telephone due to COVID-19 restrictions, and that he did not visit VA regularly for upkeep of his brace as he had received it from the Hangar clinic, are at least plausible.  

Therefore, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that his back brace, worn to treat a service-connected disability, for the 2020 calendar year, tended to wear out or tear his clothing.  Accordingly, an annual clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for a back brace must be granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107.
