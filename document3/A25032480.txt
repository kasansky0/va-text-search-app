REMAND ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU), to include referral for entitlement on an extraschedular basis, prior to May 24, 2017, is REMANDED.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1965 to July 1968.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the readjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

REASONS FOR REMAND

TDIU Effective Date

The Veteran requests an effective date prior to May 24, 2017 for entitlement to a TDIU, to include on an extraschedular basis.

Prior to May 24, 2017, the Veteran was service connected for diabetes mellitus, type II, rated 20 percent disabling; peripheral neuropathy of the right and left lower extremities, each rated 20 percent disabling; and non-compensable disabilities, to include hypertension and erectile dysfunction; the Veteran had a combined disability rating of 50 percent.  Thus, prior to May 24, 2017, the Veteran did not meet the initial eligibility requirements to receive schedular TDIU benefits.  38 C.F.R. §4.16(a).  As such, prior to May 24, 2017, a TDIU may only be granted on an extraschedular basis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). 

Although entitlement to an extraschedular TDIU is determined in the first instance by the Director, Compensation Service, the RO and the Board are tasked with making the threshold determination whether referral to the Director for extraschedular consideration is appropriate.

It is the established policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). Therefore, rating boards should submit to the Director, Compensation Service, for extra-schedular consideration all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. Id.

In support of the appeal, the Veteran submitted a November 2022 private vocational opinion, in which a consultant opined that the Veteran has been unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment, including sedentary employment, since at least 2007 due to his service-connected disabilities.

In summary, the Veteran did not meet the percentage standards set forth in § 4.16(a) for a schedular TDIU prior to May 24, 2017. However, the claims file contains a November 2022 private opinion that he was unable to work prior to that date due to his service-connected disabilities. The Board may not consider the Veteran's claim for an extraschedular TDIU in the first instance but must refer it to the Director, Compensation Service, as there is a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities prior to May 24, 2017. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

Because the November 2022 private vocational opinion was associated with the claims file prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, and extraschedular development has not been conducted, a pre-decisional error has been identified.  The claim is remanded for referral of entitlement to a TDIU, prior to May 24, 2017, to the Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:
