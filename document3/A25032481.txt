FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. A February 2022 rating decision denied service connection for cervical spine degenerative changes with possible disc herniation s/p C7 fracture, chronic low back pain, left hand carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and bilateral hip replacement.

2. The Veteran did not timely file a VA Form 10182 as to the February 2022 rating decision and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182 for the claims for entitlement to service connection for CTS, cervical spine degenerative arthritis, lumbosacral spine pain, bilateral hip replacement and flat feet.

3. In July 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, seeking service connection for carpel tunnel left hand, bilateral hip second to flat feet, flat feet, bilateral lumbosacral disorder, degenerative arthritis of cervical spine and impaired gait.

4. In a July 2022 letter, VA informed the Veteran that claims for left hand carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (now claimed as carpal tunnel left hand and chronic pain, orthopedic issues), right hip replacement associated with flatfeet, first degree and left hip replacement associated with flat feet, first degree (claimed as bilateral hip second to flat feet and back, chronic pain, orthopedic issues), chronic low back pain (now claimed as bilateral lumbosacral disorder, chronic pain, orthopedic issues secondary to flatfeet), cervical spine degenerative changes with possible disc herniation s/p c& fracture (now claimed as degenerative arthritis of cervical spine, chronic pain, orthopedic issues) and flatfeet, first degree (now claimed as flatfeet, impaired gait, chronic pain, orthopedic issues) were previously denied and a proper form was required. 

5. In August 2022, the Veteran again filed a VA Form 21-526 (for service connection) and a VA Form 21-0996 (higher level review), each seeking service connection for carpel tunnel left hand, bilateral hip second to flat feet, flat feet, bilateral lumbosacral disorder, degenerative arthritis of cervical spine and impaired gait.

6. In an October 2022 letter, VA informed the Veteran that his August 16, 2022 request for a higher level review was premature as no decision had been made.

7. An October 2022 rating decision denied service connection for impaired gait and chronic pain of left knee with DJD and impaired gait and chronic pain of right knee with DJD.

8. The Veteran did not timely file a VA Form 10182 as to the October 2022 rating decision and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182 for the claims for entitlement to service connection for right and left knee pain and degenerative joint disease.

9. In February 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526 seeking service connection for carpel tunnel left hand, bilateral hip second to flat feet, flat feet, bilateral lumbosacral disorder, degenerative arthritis of cervical spine and impaired gait.

10. In a March 2024 letter, VA informed the Veteran that the claim of service connection for carpal tunnel left hand; bilateral lumbosacral disorder; bilateral knees DJD, degenerative arthritis; bilateral hip second to flat feet; degenerative arthritis of cervical spine; depression and anxiety; flat feet; and impaired gait were previously denied and a proper form was required.

11. In response to the March 2024 letter, the Veteran filed a VA form 21-10182 Appeal to the Board citing the March 2024 letter. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

2. The criteria for an extension of the period for filing a Notice of Disagreement as to the October 2022 rating decision are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 5104C(a)(2), 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (b), 20.104, 20.105, 20.203(c).

3. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for carpal tunnel left hand; bilateral lumbosacral disorder; bilateral knees DJD, degenerative arthritis; bilateral hip second to flat feet; degenerative arthritis of cervical spine; depression and anxiety; and flat feet are met. 38 U.S.C. § 511, 7104; 5104C; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 20.104, 20.105, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1974 to March 1976.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2022 rating decision and an October 2022 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which, in part, denied the claims on appeal.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ/RO) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ/RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Likewise, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ/RO) decision, which was subsequently subject to the February 2022 higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ/RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

By way of procedural background, the Veteran initially submitted a claim for service connection in August 1976, which included a claim for pes planus (flat feet). A rating decision was issued in August 1976 that denied the claim as the Veteran's flat feet were not aggravated by his active duty military service. 

The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection in May 2020, which included claims for carpal tunnel left hand; bilateral hip DJD, degenerative arthritis; flat feet; bilateral lumbosacral disorder; and degenerative arthritis of cervical spine. In May 2020 and August 2020, VA notified the Veteran that a proper form was required as his claim for service connection of flat feet had been previously denied. A rating decision was issued in June 2021, which denied the remaining claims as they neither incurred in nor were caused by service. 

In February 2022, the Veteran sought a timely higher level review for the claims of carpal tunnel left hand; bilateral hip DJD, degenerative arthritis; bilateral lumbosacral disorder second to flat feet; and degenerative arthritis of cervical spine second to flat feet. In July 2022, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection (VA Form 21-526), that included claims for carpel tunnel left hand; bilateral hip second to flat feet; flat feet; bilateral lumbosacral disorder; degenerative arthritis of cervical spine; and impaired gait. A rating decision was issued in February 2022 that confirmed and continued the previous denials as there was no link to the Veteran's military service or to the claimed condition of flat feet. 

The Veteran sought service connection in July 2022, again filing a VA Form 21-526. In a July 2022 letter, VA informed the Veteran that his claims had been previously denied and a proper form was required. 

In August 2022, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection (VA Form 21-526), that included carpel tunnel left hand; bilateral hip second to flat feet; flat feet; bilateral lumbosacral disorder; degenerative arthritis of cervical spine; and impaired gait. 

Also in August 2022, the Veteran sought a higher level review (VA Form 21-0966), that included claims for carpal tunnel left hand; bilateral hip DJD, degenerative arthritis; bilateral lumbosacral disorder second to flat feet; and degenerative arthritis of cervical spine second to flat feet. At the same time, in an August 2022 telephone call with the Veteran, the Veteran clarified that his claim for "impaired gait" and "chronic pain" were "due to bilateral knee DJD, bilateral lumbosacral disorder, degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine, degenerative disc disease, chronic back pain, bilateral hips DJD."

In an October 2022 letter, VA advised the Veteran that his claim for a higher level of review was premature as no decision had yet been made on his claim.

Later in October 2022, a rating decision was issued that denied the claims of impaired gait and chronic pain of left knee with DJD and impaired gait and chronic pain of right knee with DJD as neither were incurred in nor caused by service. The Veteran did not appeal the decision and no additional evidence was received within a year of the denial. Therefore, the decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. 

On February 25, 2022 and October 28, 2022, the AOJ/RO sent a notification letter to the Veteran stating that he had one year from the date of the notification letter to file one of the following forms if he disagreed with the decision: (1) VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim; (2) VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review; or (3) VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.

The Board notes that the Veteran's February 2022 rating decision also became final as the Veteran did not appeal the decision and no additional evidence was received within a year of the denial. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. While the Veteran continued to file claims, a continuously pursued claim is one in which a timely and properly administrative review option is filed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). As the February 2022 rating decision was issued following a higher level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(2). Because the Veteran did not seek a supplemental review or a timely appeal to the Board, the February 2022 rating decision became final. 

The request for an extension of the period for filing a Board Appeal Request (VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement)

As noted above, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement (10182/NOD) in March 2024, seeking review of the claims. Noted on his form, the Veteran wrote: "In response to the letter from 283/DV 03012024. Please forgive any late filing due to illness, COVID." 

Recently, in Terry v. McDonough, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized that in the modernized review system, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a), a claimant may file more than one administrative review request within one year of an initial AOJ/RO decision on a claim, provided that such an administrative review request is not pending concurrently with another administrative review request. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). 

In other words, the Veteran in this case, could have requested Board review (NOD, VA Form 10182) of either the decision on the merits because the higher level review request had been completed (i.e., was not pending) and the NOD could have potentially been submitted within one year of the first initial February 2022 rating decision that had a higher level review from a June 2021 rating decision. The NOD could also have been submitted within one year of the second initial October 2022 rating decision. In this case, however, the Veteran failed to file a VA Form 10182 as it pertains to either the February 2022 or the October 2022 rating decisions. Accordingly, the holding in Terry is not applicable in this case. Instead, the Veteran is now seeking to appeal both the February 2022 and the October 2022 rating decisions through an untimely VA Form 10182 with an extension request.

VA regulations unequivocally provide that, except in limited circumstances (which do not apply here), a notice of disagreement (NOD, VA Form 10182) must be submitted to the AOJ/RO within one year of the rating decision being appealed. An NOD must identify the specific decision and issue(s) therein with which the claimant disagrees. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue(s) therein. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202, 20.203.

Additionally, VA regulations provide clear recourse in circumstances when a filing extension is required at 38 C.F.R. § 20.203 (c), which allows for an extension to be granted "for good cause" if the request is offered in writing and submitted to the Board.

The Board finds that good cause has not been shown to extend the time to file the VA Form 10182 in this case. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109 (b), when an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. This has not occurred here.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention of an illness, specifically "COVID." However, such good cause argument is not relevant to the instant matter that involves the act of timely completing and mailing the VA Form 10182 within one year of the rating decision. Specifically, the Board does not find the extension request to be good cause as the Veteran was able to file various other forms and applications within one year of the February 2022 and October 2022 rating decisions, respectfully. See e.g., July 2022, August 2022 and February 2024 VA Forms 21-526; see also August 2022 VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim. The contention by the Veteran that his filing was late due to COVID illness is found to be without merit and not sufficient for good cause.

For these reasons, the Board finds that the VA Form 10182 was untimely and good cause is not found. As such, the request for an extension of the period for filing a Board Appeal Request (VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement) as to either the February 2022 or the October 2022 rating decision is denied.

Accordingly, the Board finds a timely Notice of Disagreement was not filed as to either the February 2022 or the October 2022 rating decisions. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(1)(C); 38 C.F.R. § 20.303 (b). 

Therefore, the appeal of the February 2022 rating decision as to the issues of entitlement to service connection for cervical spine degenerative changes with possible disc herniation s/p C7 fracture, chronic low back pain, left hand carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), left hip replacement and right hip replacement are not properly before the Board and must be dismissed. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.

Likewise, the appeal of the October 2022 rating decision as to the issues of entitlement to service connection for impaired gait and chronic pain of left knee with DJD and impaired gait and chronic pain of right knee with DJD are not properly before the Board and must be dismissed. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
