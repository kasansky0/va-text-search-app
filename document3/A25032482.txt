ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for right ankle tendonitis (DC 5024-5271) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for left ankle tendonitis (DC 5024-5271) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for right ankle instability (DC 5262-5271) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for left ankle instability (DC 5262-5271) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has been service connected for bilateral pes planus (also claimed as bilateral foot pain) effective February 5, 2010, and that disorder by itself has been rated 40 percent thereafter.

2. The Veteran has also been granted separate awards of service connection for bilateral ankle tendonitis (DC 5024-5271) and bilateral ankle instability (DC 5262-5271)-each of these rated 10 percent disabling effective August 9, 2023, which is the date that an Intent to File was identified as received by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

3. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's disorder, his continuous pursuit of service connection for a foot disorder should has included consideration of the ankle disorders, and the ankle disorders at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) manifested prior to that date.  As such, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, claims for service connection for the ankle disorders should have been considered received on February 5, 2010, and service connection for the ankle disorders (as separate from pes planus) has been warranted effective that date as well-not merely effective August 9, 2023.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for right ankle tendonitis (DC 5024-5271) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.156, 3.2500, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for left ankle tendonitis (DC 5024-5271) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.156, 3.2500, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for right ankle instability (DC 5262-5271) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.156, 3.2500, 3.400.

4. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for left ankle instability (DC 5262-5271) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.156, 3.2500, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1968 March 1970, which includes verified service in the Republic of Vietnam from My 1969 to March 1970.  The claims on appeal come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of two separate rating decisions: March 30, 2024 (for ankle tendonitis), and October 31, 2024 (for ankle instability).  Separate Notices of Disagreement were both received on December 26, 2024, and both are timely to both rating decisions, so the Board will assert jurisdiction of all four of these claims (bilateral ankle tendonitis, and bilateral ankle instability).

In the December 26, 2024 VA Forms 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 30 or October 31, 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or attorney with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Forms 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. December 26, 2024 is the date of receipt for both Notices of Disagreement.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Forms 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Forms 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

This appeal is advanced on the docket on account of the Veteran's advanced age. 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2). 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c). 

Earlier Effective Dates for Service Connection

The Veteran and his attorney submitted evidence, arguments, and contentions concurrently with copies of a VA Form 10182 received on December 26, 2024.  They have clearly limited the scope of the claims as for earlier effective dates of February 5, 2010, instead of August 9, 2023 as initially granted by the AOJ. See NOD (rec'd Dec. 26, 2024 ), at Page 2 of 7 ("In a 3/30/24 Rating Decision the VA service connected [the Veteran's] left and right ankle tendonitis from 8/9/23.  Additionally, in a 10/31/24 Rating Decision the VA service connected [his] left and right ankle instability from /9/23.  [He] disagrees with the effective dates for his ankle conditions.  The effective date for each of his ankle conditions-left and right ankle tendonitis and instability-should be 2/5/10.") (boldface removed from original).  

The Board will accordingly accept jurisdiction as limited to this argument and grant it in full. See generally Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board to search the record and address procedural arguments when the Veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).  By granting this claim in full, the Veteran cannot be prejudiced by the Board's jurisdiction pursuant to the updated system set forth by the AMA. See Attorney Correspondence Accompanying VA Form 10182 (rec'd Dec. 26, 2024 )

1. Entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for right ankle tendonitis (DC 5024-5271) is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for left ankle tendonitis (DC 5024-5271) is granted.

3. Entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for right ankle instability (DC 5262-5271) is granted.

4. Entitlement to an effective date of February 5, 2010, but no earlier, for service connection for left ankle instability (DC 5262-5271) is granted.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  On August 16, 2022, the Board granted the Veteran's claim for service connection for preexisting bilateral pes planus aggravated beyond natural progression, and the following August 22, 2022 rating decision implements the initial 40 percent rating effective February 5, 2010. See BVA Decision (Aug. 16, 2022); Rating Decision (Aug. 22, 2022).  Meanwhile, the rating decisions on appeal establish that the ankles are entitled to separate service connection effective no later than August 9, 2023. See generally Rating Decisions (Mar. 30, 2024; Oct. 31, 2024); VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File (Aug. 9, 2023); VA Form 21-526EZ (rec'd Nov. 21, 2023).

The Veteran's and his attorney's argument is essentially one question: whether they have been pursuing claims for service connection for the ankle disorders ever since February 5, 2010, or else whether they only intended to file that claim on or after August 9, 2023.

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has explained that, in an original claim for service connection, the date entitlement arises is governed by the date the claim is received, not the date of the medical evidence submitted to support a particular claim.??See McGrath v. Gober, 14?Vet. App.?28 (2000).  Where a prior?unappealed?decision becomes final and binding on a Veteran, the effective date of a subsequent award of service connection is the date of receipt of a reopened claim, not the date of receipt of the original claim.? Sears v. Principi, 16?Vet. App.?244 (2002);?Melton v. West, 13?Vet. App.?442 (2000). 

Under VA laws and regulations, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the VA must be filed?in order for?benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under laws administered by the VA.??38?U.S.C. §?5101(a);?38?C.F.R. §?3.151(a).? Any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by the VA, and identifying the benefits sought, may be considered an informal claim.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.155(a). 

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  

The Veteran's bilateral pes planus disorder is currently effective February 5, 2010.  The Veteran's attorney is claiming that that should also serve as the date of receipt of these claims for service connection for ankle disorders. See generally Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009) (holding a claimant may adequately identify the disability for which compensation benefits are sought by referring to a body part or system that is disabled or by describing the symptoms of that disability).  In order to fully consider this argument, the Board will adjudicate these claims as if the standard forms amendment does not apply.

The provisions of?38?U.S.C. §?5101(a) mandate that a claim must be filed?in order for?any type of benefit to accrue or be paid.??See?Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998).? Further, the mere presence of medical evidence in the record does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for the benefit in question.??Brannon v. West, 12?Vet. App.?32, 34-5 (1998).? While the Board must interpret the Veteran's submissions broadly, the Board is not required to conjure up issues that were not raised by the Veteran.? Id.? 

The word "claim" includes a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a?benefit.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.1(p);?Brannon v. West, 12?Vet. App.?32, 34-35 (1998);?Servello v.?Derwinski,?3?Vet. App.?196, 199 (1992).? Any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA from a Veteran may?be considered to be?an informal claim.? Such an informal claim must identify the benefits sought.? Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.??38?C.F.R. §?3.155(a).? To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim.??See?Quarles v.?Derwinski,?3?Vet. App.?129, 134 (1992). 

From March 25, 2015 forward, a claim for benefits must be filed on the standardized claim form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.150, 3.151. A veteran may also indicate their intent to file a claim for compensation by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA must provide the claimant with the appropriate claims form.  Id.  If a complete application for benefits on the form prescribed by the Secretary is received by VA within one year of receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the formal claim to have been filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. Id.  There is no doubt that the claim for pes planus was received no later than February 5, 2010, while a separate claim for the ankles was received no later than August 9, 2023.

In this regard, VA may not pay a benefit before a claim is made.??38?U.S.C. §?5101;?Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (stating that "[38 U.S.C.A. §] 5101 is a clause of general applicability and mandates that a claim must be filed in order for any type of benefits to... be paid under the laws administered by the Secretary.")? The mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for a disability.?Lalonde v. West, 12?Vet. App.?377, 382 (1999);?Brannon v. West, 12?Vet. App.?32, 35 (1998).? More specifically, a medical examination report is only considered an informal claim for an increase in disability benefits if service connection has already been established for the disability.??MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2006);?see also?38?C.F.R. §?3.157(b)(1) (medical records can serve as informal claim "when such reports relate to examination or treatment of a disability for which service-connection has previously been established").? Likewise, the mere presence of a disability does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service?connection for that condition.??Crawford v. Brown,?5?Vet. App.?33, 35 (1995);?KL v. Brown,?5?Vet. App.?205, 208 (1993).

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.304.  Service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Walker v. Shinseki, 701 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant; however, if the evidence of record is persuasive for or against the claim, then the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is instead adjudicated in accordance with the evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

In this case, the Board has thoroughly reviewed the Veteran's complete claims file for every communication received or generated from February 5, 2010 (the effective date for pes planus, and the requested effective date for the ankle disorders) to prior to August 9, 2023 (the current effective date of service connection for the bilateral ankle disorders), so as to fully consider all evidence for any potential earlier effective date.

Although the Board must provide adequate reasons and bases for a decision, the Board need not discuss all evidence of record.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The analysis below focuses on what the relevant evidence shows, or fails to show, with respect to the Veteran's claims on appeal. Consequently, any evidence not discussed within this decision is irrelevant, duplicative, or unfavorable to the Veteran's claims.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the appellant).

The Veteran requests an earlier effective date of February 5, 2010, or otherwise prior to August 9, 2023, for service connection for the bilateral ankle disorders-tendonitis and instability.  The Board completely understands the argument. See VA Form 10182 and all Accompanying Arguments and Evidence (rec'd Dec. 26, 2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.158; Massie v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 123, 134 (2011).   

Prior to March 24, 2015, filings were historically more liberally accepted without as much concern for the exact form used.  The Veteran and his attorney assert that when the AOJ and Board had previously developed the claim for a bilateral foot disorder, they should have inferred this claim for the bilateral ankle disorders at the same time. See generally, cf. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) (new and material evidence received within the one year period prior to the decision becoming final or received prior to the appellate decision if a timely appeal has been filed is to be considered as having been received in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period); Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1406 -07 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding that a claim remains pending where VA failed to fulfill a statutory duty to determine the character of newly submitted evidence and declining to presume that VA considered records of which it had notice, but never obtained); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (noting that 3.156(b) requires VA to determine whether subsequently submitted evidence constituted new and material evidence relating to an earlier claim); Manlincon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 239 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 20.20.

The Veteran's claim for the bilateral foot disorder was first adjudicated in an April 5, 2011 rating decision. See Rating Decision (Apr. 5, 2011).  Another explanatory letter to this effect was sent on May 11, 2011. See Notification Letter (rec'd May 11, 2011).  The Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement on April 18, 2012. See NOD (Apr. 18, 2012).  If there were any defect in the timeliness of the receipt of this NOD, see generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b), Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024), the Board is bound by earlier-in-time findings of fact that are favorable.  When the AOJ assigned an initial rating effective February 5, 2010, the AOJ clearly concluded that the April 2011 rating decision was not final.  As such, the Board has no choice but to conclude that the claim has been continuously prosecuted.  Even if the Board were not bound by this finding, the Board would have granted the necessary exception to this claims-processing rule. See Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 44-47 (2009).

The April 2011 Notice of Disagreement was received prior to the Board's ultimate granting of service connection for pes planus.  In the NOD, the Veteran offered evidence of ankle pain to prove his entitlement to service connection for foot pain. See NOD (rec'd Apr. 18, 2012) ("I also have acquired deformity of foot-Equinus (both feet) with pain in my ankles, calves, legs, back, and neck.  I have a limited range of ankle motion due to tightness in my Achilles tendon.  I wear an ankle brace to reduce the pain.  I have to wear shoes a size larger and extra wide so that my orthotics can fit inside them.").  By virtue of this NOD and the arguments memorialized in it, the Board is accepting the Veteran's and attorney's arguments, urging the Board to sympathetically apply Brokowski v. Shinseki to this claim in assigning an effective date of February 5, 2010. 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009) (holding a claimant may adequately identify the disability for which compensation benefits are sought by referring to a body part or system that is disabled or by describing the symptoms of that disability).  As such, the Board will conclude that service connection was warranted effective then-not merely effective August 9, 2023, which was formerly the more recent date that the AOJ determined that this claim for service connection was initiated by an Intent to File. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).  

The claims for an earlier effective date for service connection for the Veteran's bilateral ankle disorders (tendonitis and instability) are hereby GRANTED to February 5, 2010. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400(b)(2)(i); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (where the law, not the evidence, is dispositive, the appeal should be terminated for lack of legal merit or entitlement).  The Board determines that granting this claim to that extent is a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal, because the Veteran and his attorney limited their argument to that date. See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 39 (1993) (citing Hamilton v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 528, 544 (1993)), supra.  

Notwithstanding this limitation, if there were any such claim for an even earlier effective date prior to February 5, 2010, then the remainder of this claim would be denied as meritless. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (where the law, not the evidence, is dispositive, the appeal should be terminated for lack of legal merit or entitlement).  Prior to February 5, 2010, there are exactly eleven documents ever associated with the Veteran's claims file for any reason, and none of these documents could have been reasonably construed as receipt of this claim for service connection.  

The Board will finally note in passing that while the claims for earlier effective dates are being granted, the AOJ will assign new initial ratings, because there are now portions of the appellate period where the service-connected ankle disorders are not rated (namely from February 5, 2010 until prior to August 9, 2023).  If the Veteran should disagree with these initial ratings, then he and/or his attorney must file a Supplemental Claim within one year of the next rating decision.  As a matter of law, ratings may be limited by the Amputation Rule, which states that the combined rating for disabilities of an extremity shall not exceed the rating for the amputation at the elective level, were amputation to be performed. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.68.  As this rule may apply to this claim (where initial ratings for the ankles need to be assigned effective February 5, 2010, while pes planus is already rated 40 percent disabling for that same timeframe), the Veteran might already be in receipt of maximum benefits for disabilities below the knees, regardless of the outcome of this Board decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5024, 5165, 5262, 5271.  Regardless, the Board is granting the claim for earlier effective dates in full.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
