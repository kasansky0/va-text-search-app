DOCKET NO. 231016-384831
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, to include as due to toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

During the period on appeal, the Veteran's GERD manifested in dysphagia, pyrosis, regurgitation, material weight loss, and frequent episodes of nausea productive of considerable impairment of health; severe impairment of health is not demonstrated.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for GERD are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1985 to March 1988.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD.

The Veteran asserts that he should be afforded a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for his service-connected GERD because the condition is severe. 09/13/2023 VA Form 20-0996. This appeal stems from the initial February 2023 claim of service connection for GERD.

The Board notes that, effective May 19, 2024, VA amended the schedule of ratings for the digestive system and created Diagnostic Code 7206 for GERD. Prior to May 19, 2024, GERD did not have its own Diagnostic Code and VA generally rated the condition by analogy to hiatal hernia under Diagnostic Code 7346. Because the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision on appeal, which was issued almost a year before the new criteria went into effect, and because the rating schedule changed after the evidentiary window closed, there is no evidence to consider under the new criteria.

During the period on appeal, the Veteran's GERD is rated by analogy to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346, for hiatal hernia. Pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. A maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 

Diagnostic Code 7346 does not provide definitions for the terms "considerable" and "severe." The Board finds, however, that these terms are unambiguous and, therefore, a plain dictionary meaning is an appropriate definition. Cf. Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019).  "Considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267 (11th ed. 2012). "Severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." Id. at 1140. 

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's GERD manifested in symptoms more nearly approximating the criteria for a 30 percent rating. See Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470, 472 (2006) (stating that disabilities rated by analogy will not show all objective criteria of the analogous rating).

The Veteran underwent VA examination in connection with this claim in July 2023. He described waking in the middle of the night "choking" from acid reflux, which caused him to have poor sleep and decreased focus. He stated that he had burning in his throat while at work, which affected his concentration. He treated his symptoms by taking over-the-counter antacids every two to three hours. The examiner noted symptoms of dysphagia, pyrosis, regurgitation, and material weight loss. They also noted nausea, with four or more episodes per year lasting for ten days or more. There was no evidence of esophageal spasm, stricture, or acquired diverticulum. 

VA treatment records are not in conflict with the findings noted on examination.

Upon review, the Board finds the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's symptoms more nearly approximate the diagnostic criteria for a 30 percent rating pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7346. In that regard, the July 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran experienced symptoms of dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, as well as material weight loss. He had frequent, long episodes of nausea. Given these symptoms, in particular material weight loss, as well as the Veteran's reports that the symptoms affect his sleep and concentration, the Board finds there is evidence of considerable impairment of health. Accordingly, resolving the benefit of the doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the Veteran's GERD should be assigned a 30 percent rating pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7346.

However, a higher 60 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7346 is not warranted unless there are symptoms commensurate with pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. Here, there is no evidence that the Veteran's nausea results in vomiting, nor is there is evidence of hematemesis, melena, anemia, or similar symptoms. As such, the Board finds the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's symptoms are not productive of severe impairment of health and a higher 60 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7346 is not warranted.

In view of the foregoing, resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, a 30 percent rating, and no higher, is warranted for GERD. The evidence persuasively weights against a rating in excess of 30 percent at any time during the appeal period. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, to include as due to TERA.

The Veteran asserts that he developed prostate cancer as a result of his active service, specifically as due to in-service exposure to aqueous film fighting foam (AFFF) and/or asbestos. 01/13/2023 VA 21-526EZ; 03/29/2023 CAPRI, p. 1.

Under the PACT Act, VA is required to provide a disability examination and medical nexus opinion when a veteran submits a compensation claim and has evidence of a disability and participation in a TERA, but the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability. See 38?U.S.C. §?1168(a) (see PACT Act, Sec. 303). Here, the Veteran was afforded a TERA examination in May 2023, and the examiner provided a positive nexus opinion relating prostate cancer to exposure to toxins. However, after the opinion was provided, in June 2023, the AOJ issued a memorandum which found that the Veteran had not participated in a TERA, but did not provide any information as to what development, if any, was conducted in order to determine whether the Veteran was exposed to AFFF and/or asbestos, as alleged. 06/06/2023 VA Memo.

Accordingly, as the failure to adequately address the Veteran's alleged exposures constitutes a pre-decisional error in the duty to assist, the Board finds remand is required in order to properly develop these contentions.
