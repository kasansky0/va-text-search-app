CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of the claim for entitlement to service connection for anxiety have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for withdrawal of the claim for entitlement to service connection for depression have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2015 to August 2019.

In May 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claims of entitlement to service connection for anxiety and entitlement to service connection for depression, most recently addressed in a December 2020 rating decision. 

In June 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received, and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

In January 2025, the Veteran appealed to the Board.  In his VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), he elected the Direct Review docket. 

Withdrawal of Appeal

1. Entitlement to service connection for anxiety

2. Entitlement to service connection for depression

An appeal may be withdrawn in writing at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by a veteran, appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

Except for appeals withdrawn on the record at a hearing, appeal withdrawals must be in writing and meet certain requirements set forth by regulation.  Specifically, they must include the name of the veteran or appellant, the applicable file number, and a statement that the appeal is being withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).

In a February 2025 statement, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, stated that he wished to withdraw the appeal for his claims for service connection for anxiety and depression, which corresponds to his January 2025 VA Form 10182.  See February 2025 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

The Board finds that the February 2025 signed written statement documenting the Veteran's request constitutes a valid withdrawal of his appeal with respect to the above stated issues, as the statement complies with the requirement of the applicable regulation by including the name of the appellant, the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal as to these issues is withdrawn.  See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 8 (2020).  

Therefore, the Board finds that the appeal with respect to these issues has been withdrawn.  When a pending appeal is withdrawn, there is no longer an allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration.  In such circumstances, dismissal of the appeal is appropriate.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5). 

Accordingly, as there remain no allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration as to the issues of entitlement to service connection for anxiety and entitlement to service connection for depression, the appeal of these issues is dismissed.

In dismissing the appeal, the Board acknowledges the recent precedential decision Williams v. McDonough in which the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  Nevertheless, in the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn his claims.  When a claim is withdrawn, it ceases to exist, is no longer pending, and is not viable.  See Hanson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 29, 30 (1996).  As the above claims were withdrawn and ceased to exist, the Veteran could not request a docket switch.  Accordingly, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in dismissing the withdrawn appeal prior to the expiration of the period specified in 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).
