FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an unappealed July 2018 legacy rating decision, the Veteran was denied entitlement to service connection for scarlet fever and a heart disability. 

2. The evidence received since the July 2018 legacy rating decision was not previously part of the evidence of record at the time of the prior denials and tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue with the claims.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. New and relevant evidence has been presented to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for scarlet fever. 38 U.S.C. § 5108 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d); 3.2501 (2024).

2. New and relevant evidence has been presented to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for a heart disability. 38 U.S.C. § 5108 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d); 3.2501 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty for training from August 1984 to February 1985 and active service from December 1990 to September 1991 in the United States Marine Corps. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2019 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the August 2019 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on October 24, 2023. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2019 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or their representative, at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the April 2019 rating decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

By way of history, this case was previously denied by the Board in February 2024. The Veteran appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In November 2024, the Court granted a Joint Motion of the parties, vacated the Board's decision, and remanded the case to the Board for action consistent with the Joint Motion. The case has since been returned to the Board for further appellate action.

Claims to Readjudicate

In a July 2018 legacy rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for scarlet fever and heart disability. The AOJ found that that neither disability was incurred in or caused by his active service. The Veteran did not appeal. The evidence that has been received since the July 2018 legacy rating decision include the Veteran's hearing testimony. Specifically, the Veteran testified that he developed symptoms of scarlet fever and was quarantined for several days during boot camp. He explained that he was diagnosed with a heart disability which VA physicians related to scarlet fever during service. The Board finds that the additional evidence is new and relevant as it may prove or disprove that the Veteran's scarlet fever and heart disability are related to his active service. Therefore, readjudication of the claims is warranted. To that extent only, the appeal is allowed.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service Connection - Scarlet/Rheumatic Fever and Heart Disability

In the rating decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that new and relevant evidence had not been submitted to warrant readjudication of the claims of entitlement to service connection for Scarlet and/or rheumatic fever and a heart disability. As discussed above, the Board finds that readjudication is warranted. Therefore, a remand is necessary to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty in this case. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Correct the error in satisfying the regulatory or statutory duty in the readjudication of the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for Scarlet and/or rheumatic fever and a heart disability.
