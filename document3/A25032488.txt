ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder strain and shoulder impingement nerve syndrome is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran incurred right shoulder pain in service which has continued since service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right shoulder condition have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131,  5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1975 to August 1979. He was honorably discharged. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2024  rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied a supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder condition.  In August 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) requesting the direct review docket.  In September 2024, the Veteran timely filed a NOD electing to change to an evidence submission docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the September 2024 VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the September 2024 VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the September 2024 VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

By way of background, the Veteran filed an April 2024 supplemental claim to reopen a claim for a right shoulder injury which was filed in May 1980, which was within the one year of his August 1979 separation from service. While the Veteran was advised that the VA was having difficulty obtaining his service treatment records (STRs), the evidentiary record is such that it appears that the Veteran may have never received a decision on this claim.

The denial of due process may include issuing a Board decision prior to the expiration of the one-year period for a claimant to request a docket change. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, the Board is granting the claim for service connection for a right shoulder condition. As such, this is a full grant of the benefit sought. Accordingly, the Veteran's due process rights are not adversely affected by not waiting until July 31, 2025, the end of the period in which to request a docket change.  

The Board notes that, in his NOD, the Veteran included reference to an earlier effective date issue that was not the subject of the rating decision on appeal and premature as it was prior to the assignment of an effective date. Thus, the downstream issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 1979 for the award of service connection for a shoulder condition is not properly before the Board. The Board will therefore limit its analysis to those issues in the July 2024 rating decision.

Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder strain is granted.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability that are subject to lay observation. 38 U.S.C. § 1153 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support presence of disability even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence).

Depending on the evidence and the contentions of record in a particular case, lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis and medical etiology of a condition. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Specifically, lay evidence may be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis where (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.  Additionally, where symptoms are capable of lay observation, a lay witness is competent to testify to a lack of symptoms prior to service, continuity of symptoms after in-service injury or disease, and receipt of medical treatment for such symptoms. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002). Lay testimony is not competent to determine the extent or etiology of  matters which require medical testing and expertise to determine. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).

The claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a).  The VA shall consider all information, including lay and medical evidence of record.  VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claims of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) 

The Board will consider if the criteria for service connection have been met.

The July 2024 rating decision conceded the first element of service connection, a current disability of shoulder strain and shoulder impingement nerve syndrome.  The decision also conceded the second element of service connection, an inservice injury. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Thus, the Board finds the first and second elements of service connection are satisfied.  

The third element of service connection is a nexus between the current disability and the inservice injury. The Veteran's February 1979 STR noted that the Veteran had strained his right shoulder two months prior and had pain ever since that time. The Veteran advised the examiner that sometimes the pain goes away, but then recurs constantly. The Veteran noted that the onset was due to excessive use while swabbing the deck. The shoulder was described as a generally well shoulder with normal range of motion but tenderness with external rotation. The diagnosis was right shoulder strain, and the Veteran was prescribed analgesics.

In September 1979, the Veteran submitted an application for compensation for right shoulder pain which he asserted began in October 1978. He further stated that his right shoulder had been treated in February 1979. 

The December 1979 VA shoulder examination noted that the Veteran's right shoulder had no tenderness, crepitus, or pain and he had excellent muscle strength and normal deep tendon reflexes.  During the examination, the Veteran stated that his shoulder had not bothered him for one or two months. The examiner noted that the Veteran had a history of mild intermittent arthralgia.

After service, the Veteran sought VA treatment for his right shoulder in November 1997, November 1998, and October 2010.  The Veteran sought private treatment for his chronic right shoulder pain in March 2008, June 2018, February 2021.

 The May 2024 VA shoulder examination report noted a diagnosis of shoulder strain diagnosed in January 1979 and shoulder impingement syndrome diagnosed in February 2021. The Veteran advised the examiner that for treatment he went to a chiropractor, physical therapy, and took narcotics for pain control. The Veteran stated that he was advised he needed shoulder surgery in 2008 or 2009 but declined.  

The May 2024 nexus examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's claimed condition of right shoulder pain and loss of range of motion was incurred in or caused by the complaints in service. The examiner noted that the STR was silent for shoulder "pain AND loss of range of motion." Additionally, the symptoms in the STRs were not congruent with the shoulder symptomatology during the May 2024 examination.  The examiner concluded that based on these facts a nexus had not been established between the claim of right shoulder pain and loss of range of motion.  

The STR did note shoulder pain. While the STR noted a normal range of motion, it also noted tenderness with external rotation range of motion. The diagnosis in service was shoulder strain and the May 2024 examiner also noted a diagnosis of shoulder strain. The May 2024 VA examiner noted there was evidence of pain with weight bearing, non-weight bearing, with active and passive motion, and the pain caused functional loss.  Accordingly, the symptoms in 1979 were pain and pain with motion and the May 2024 examination report described similar symptoms. The examiner did not explain how the symptoms were not congruent and also did not consider that the Veteran's 1979 shoulder strain may have worsened over the decades to include shoulder nerve impingement syndrome.   

The inservice diagnosis of shoulder strain is the same diagnosis in May 2024.  Additionally, while in service, the Veteran stated that the pain was on and off but always recurring.  After service he complained that the pain had continued off and on after service. Specifically, the Veteran's April 2024 statement in support of his claim noted that his shoulder pain was chronic and continued since service. Giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds the third element of service connection, the nexus requirement, has been satisfied. 

Accordingly, as all three elements of service connection have been met, the Board finds the Veteran's right shoulder condition is service connected. Therefore, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's right shoulder condition is related to his active-duty service.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

In reaching this determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. The approximate balance of the evidence is in favor of the Veteran's claim of service connection for a right shoulder condition.  As such, that doctrine is applicable in the instant appeal, and his claim must be granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, supra.
