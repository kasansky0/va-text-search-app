ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic right wrist sprain is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's chronic right wrist sprain was incurred in or caused by the in-service injury, event, or illness.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for chronic right wrist sprain have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1986 - July 1986 and January 1991 - September 1991.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision issued by a Regional Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran wants VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify that evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, it is acknowledged that ordinarily under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board may not decide an appeal before one year from the rating decision at issue.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, however, the Veteran submitted a statement requesting to "expedite all claims" The Board interprets this request as a Williams waiver. The Board also finds that the Veteran is not prejudiced by having the claim adjudicated now, as the instant decision represents a complete grant of the benefits sought on appeal in this matter. 

Entitlement to service connection for chronic right wrist sprain

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active military service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. To prevail on the issue of service connection there must be competent evidence of a current disability; medical evidence, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and competent evidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran contends that a chronic right wrist sprain is related to an injury suffered during active-duty service. 

The Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability, specifically a chronic right wrist sprain. See Compensation & Pension (C&P) Examination conducted by S.B, August 2, 2024. 

The record demonstrates that the Veteran experienced a right wrist injury while on active duty in May 1986 playing football. The Veteran reinjured the same wrist in June 1986. While radiological examinations were performed, there were no fractures noted. See Service Treatment Records. 

The Board finds that the Veteran suffered from an in-service occurrence of a disease or injury, specifically that the Veteran experienced a right wrist injury while playing football.

Turning to the nexus element, the Board has considered the lay and medical evidence of record. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination regarding his wrist in August 2024. The VA examiner noted that the onset of the right wrist injury was 1986, while the Veteran was on active duty. See C&P Examination conducted by S.B. 

After conducting the medical examination of the Veteran, S.B. provided an opinion regarding the etiology of the Veteran's right wrist sprain. The examiner found that the Veteran's right wrist sprain is related to the in-service injury to the right wrist while playing football. This opinion is supported by the record and appropriate rationale. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's right wrist sprain was incurred in, or caused by, the in-service injury, event, or illness. 

Based on the foregoing, entitlement to service connection for a right wrist sprain is granted.
