REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability is denied. is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in active-duty service with the Army from December 1966 to August 1969.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The Veteran submitted a December 2023 10182 form selecting the Direct Review option.

Procedurally, the December 2023 10182 submission shows the Veteran appealed only the October 2023 rating decision and listed the issues appealed for TDIU and an increased evaluation for prostate cancer.

The Board notes that a number of rating decisions were issued in March 2023; June 2023; July 2023; September 2023; October 2023; and November 2023 within one year prior to the Veteran's December 2023 10182 submission. The Board notes that a March 2023 rating decision proposed to decrease the evaluation of the Veteran's prostate cancer, and the reduction was made in a July 2023 rating decision. Review of the record does not show the Veteran made any statements or submitted any documentation to indicate any appeal of the July 2023 rating decision that made the reduction.

Review of the October 2023 rating decision shows the rating decision adjudicated entitlement to TDIU; a proposed decrease of the evaluation of an acquired psychiatric disorder; and deferred an increased evaluation for prostate cancer. The Board notes that a deferred issue is not a decision on the merits of the claims and therefore not appealable. See 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.201 ; Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011) (concluding that a deferred rating decision does not constitute an appealable adjudicative action). 

The Veteran has not submitted any statements or clarified that he was appealing any other rating decision besides the October 2023 rating decision; the Board notes that in an October 2023 statement following the October 2023 rating decision, the Veteran only disagreed with the proposed reduction of the acquired psychiatric disorder.

As such, the Board finds the issue on appeal before the Board at this time is for entitlement to TDIU.

In a March 2024 Board decision, the Board denied entitlement to TDIU. The Veteran appealed the Board decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC, or the Court); the Court in a November 2024 decision vacated and returned the issue to the Board.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.900(c). 38 U.S.C. ยง 7107(a)(2).

The Board finds remand is warranted for additional development.

A June 2023 Social Security Administration (SSA) inquiry shows the Veteran was awarded entitlement effective from June 2011. The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for prostate cancer effective from January 2011; reported that he retired in June 2011; and has submitted statements as how the residuals of his prostate cancer had affected his ability to work including prior to his retirement.

Review of the claims record does not show that any SSA records have been associated with the claims record. As the SSA records may provide pertinent evidence as to the Veteran's claims, remand is warranted to obtain possible outstanding SSA records that relate to the Veteran's claim. See Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1321 (2010).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Confirm with the Social Security Administration (SSA) whether the Veteran was receiving SSA disability benefits, obtain the Veteran's SSA records relating to the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer and associate them with the Veteran's claims file. All records/responses received must be associated with the electronic claims file.
