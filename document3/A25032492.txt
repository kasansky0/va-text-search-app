REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from March 2005 to March 2009 and from September 2009 to June 2019; however, he is presently eligible for VA benefits for his first term of service only, as his second term was deemed dishonorable.

In January 2023 and February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of December 2022 and January 2023 rating decisions.  In March 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior rating decisions.  

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decisions which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a neck disorder is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a traumatic brain injury is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for left knee fracture to include a strain with osteoarthritis is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

The Veteran requested an informal conference in his January 20, 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review. According to 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601(h), the AOJ will undertake "reasonable efforts to contact the claimant and/or the authorized representative, to conduct one informal conference during a higher level of review, but if such reasonable efforts are not successful, a decision may be issued in the absence of an informal conference."

The record does not reflect that the AOJ undertook the requisite "reasonable efforts" to schedule the informal conference before deciding the claims. Therefore, a remand is necessary to correct this error by the agency of original jurisdiction "in satisfying a regulatory duty." 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

On remand, reasonable efforts should be conducted to contact the Veteran and/or his authorized representative and to schedule the Veteran for an informal conference to afford him full due process in this case.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Undertake reasonable efforts to conduct the informal conference for the matters herein on appeal, as requested by the Veteran in the January 2023 VA Form 20-0996. Document the claims file specifying what steps were taken to contact and conduct the informal conference, as well as the outcome of the conference, if held.
