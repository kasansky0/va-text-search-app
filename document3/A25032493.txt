ORDER

The appeal of the proposed action to reduce the disability rating for the service-connected posterior right hip painful scar, status post right total hip joint replacement, from 10 percent to 0 percent is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The June 2024 rating decision that proposed to reduce the rating for the service-connected posterior right hip painful scar, status post right total hip joint replacement, is not an appealable decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The June 2024 proposed rating reduction for the service-connected posterior right hip painful scar, status post right total hip joint replacement, is not a final rating action; therefore, there is no question of law or fact on appeal with regard to this issue.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 20.104, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from July 1988 to August 1999.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on an attempted appeal from a non-final June 2024 determination of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which proposed to reduce the evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected posterior right hip painful scar, status post right total hip joint replacement, from 10 percent to 0 percent (noncompensable).  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. The appeal of the proposed action to reduce the disability rating for the service-connected posterior right hip painful scar, status post right total hip joint replacement, from 10 percent to 0 percent, is dismissed.

As noted above, in a June 2024 action, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) proposed to reduce the evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected posterior right hip painful scar, status post right total hip joint replacement, from 10 percent to 0 percent (noncompensable), and the Veteran attempted to appeal the matter by submitting a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.  

The June 2024 decision, however, is not a final agency action.  Rather, a rating decision merely noting a proposed agency action (in this case a proposed reduction in the evaluation assigned the service-connected posterior right hip painful scar, status post right total hip joint replacement) is not binding on the agency and does not change the Veteran's level of compensation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105; see also Majeed v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 421, 433-34 (2002).

Upon issuance of the June 2024 proposal, the Veteran had 60-days to provide evidence as to why the change should not be made.  See VA Notification Letter dated June 5, 2024; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) (describing the procedural requirements that must be accomplished before a rating for a service-connected disability can be reduced, including issuance of a proposed reduction with notice requirements and allowing 60 days for additional evidence to be submitted).  Thereafter, the AOJ would issue a final decision.  See id.  

Given that the Veteran has appealed a proposed determination from the RO, as opposed to a decision making a final determination, the appeal in this matter cannot proceed at this time.  With the submission of the July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran prematurely sought to appeal from the June 2024 rating decision that proposed a reduced disability rating for the service-connected posterior right hip painful scar, status post right total hip joint replacement.  Unfortunately, however, from a procedural standpoint, this determination is not a finalized decision.  In other words, at the time the Veteran filed her appeal, there was not yet a question of law or fact to be appealed.  As such, the appeal must be denied as there is no final rating decision at present.  See Hargrove v. Shinseki, 629 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (affirming a dismissal of a writ recognizing the RO decision proposing a reduction was not a final decision and the Veteran had not yet exhausted administrative remedies).

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5).  As this matter is not ripe for appellate consideration, the claim must be dismissed.
