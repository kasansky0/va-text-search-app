ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for primary open angle glaucoma with pinguecula is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right elbow disorder is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a left elbow disorder is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's primary open angle glaucoma with pinguecula manifests as impaired visual acuity to no worse than 20/100 in the right eye and no worse than 20/100 in the left eye; impaired visual fields with an average concentric contraction of no less than 39.625 degrees in the right eye and no less than 34.375 degrees in the left eye; and 0 incapacitating episodes in a twelve-month period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a compensable disability rating/disability rating in excess of 70 percent for primary open angle glaucoma with pinguecula have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.75-4.79, Diagnostic Codes 6013, Diagnostic Code 6066, Diagnostic Code 6080. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2006 to March 2015. The Veteran's awards include the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with 2 Campaign Stars; Army Commendation Medal (4th Award); Army Achievement Medal (5th Award); NATO Medal (2nd Award); Meritorious Unit Commendation; Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal; National Defense Service Medal; Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; Overseas Service Ribbon (5th Award); and Badge with Driver-Wheeled Vehicle Clasp (2nd Award). The Board thanks the Veteran for his honorable service to our Nation!

On August 23, 2017, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Pub. L. No. 115-55, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017) went into effect. This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review on or after February 19, 2019. As this case is an appeal of a September 2023 rating decision, this decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework. 

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) electing direct review by a Veterans Law Judge.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for a skin disorder, a left elbow disorder, and a right elbow disorder, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Finally, the Board notes that many of the Veteran's claims from his May 2023 supplemental claim have not been addressed in ratings decisions. These claims were also appealed in his November 2023 VA Form 10182, despite not having a corresponding rating decision. The Board notes that it cannot rule on these issues without a rating decision. However, the Board advises that the AOJ should reassess the May 2023 claim and see if any of the Veteran's claims have not been addressed in subsequent rating decisions.  

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The ratings are intended to compensate impairment in earning capacity due to a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of a veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for primary open angle glaucoma with pinguecula

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a higher disability rating for his open angle glaucoma with pinguecula.

Evaluations of defective vision from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.76(a), 4.79. The examination for visual impairment must be conducted by a licensed optometrist or by a licensed ophthalmologist and the examiner must identify the disease, injury, or any other pathologic found. 38 C.F.R. § 4.76(b). Examination of visual fields or muscle function will be conducted only when there is a medical indication of disease or injury that may be associated with visual field defect or impaired muscle function. Id. Unless medically contraindicated, the fundus must be examined with the Veteran's pupils dilated. Id.

Unless otherwise directed, evaluate diseases of the eye under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Codes 6000 through 6009. Impairment of Visual Acuity is rated under Diagnostic Codes 6061 through 6066. Impairment of Visual Fields is rated under Diagnostic Codes 6080 through 6081. Impairment of Muscle Function is rated under Diagnostic Codes 6090 through 6091.

The Veteran is rated under Diagnostic Code 6013-6080. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the specific basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown as a hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

As a preliminary matter, the Board finds that a change in the Veteran's assigned Diagnostic Code is warranted. The Board notes that the Court has held that the selection of a particular Diagnostic Code "is a determination that is completely dependent upon the facts of a particular case," and the Board has discretion in determining the appropriate Diagnostic Code. Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993) (applying the more deferential "arbitrary, capricious" standard, rather than de novo review, to the Board's determination of the appropriate Diagnostic Code).

The Veteran is currently assigned a 70 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6013-6080 for visual impairments due to open-angle glaucoma.

Therefore, the Board finds that a rating under Diagnostic Code 6013-6080 is not the appropriate Diagnostic Code to rate the Veteran's disability. The evidence does show that the Veteran is diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma. As such, the Board finds that a rating under Diagnostic Code 6013 for open-angle glaucoma is the more appropriate Diagnostic Code. Accordingly, the Board finds that the appropriate Diagnostic Code for the Veteran's disability is Diagnostic Code 6013.

The Board further notes that the Veteran's current disability has been rated under Diagnostic Code 6013-6080 for over 10 years and is afforded protection under 38 U.S.C. § 1159. However, the Board finds that a change in the Diagnostic Code will not result in a reduction of the current disability rating or severance of service connection. Therefore, the Board finds that a change in the Diagnostic Code does not violate the Veteran's rights under 38 U.S.C. § 1159.

Diagnostic Code 6013 provides that the Veteran's disability shall be rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye.

The General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate on the basis of either visual impairment due to a particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation.

Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 10 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 3 but less than 5 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 20 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 5 but less than 7 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 40 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring 7 or more treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 60 percent rating is warranted.

Note (1) indicates that, for the purposes of evaluations under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes. Note (2) indicates that examples of treatment may include but are not limited to: systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions. Note (3) indicates that, for the purposes of evaluating visual impairment due to a particular condition, refer to 38 C.F.R. § 4.75-4.78 and to § 4.79, DCs 6061-6091.

Examinations of visual acuity must include the central uncorrected and corrected visual acuity for distance and near vision using Snellen's test type or its equivalent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.76(a). Evaluation of central visual acuity on the basis of corrected distance vision with central fixation, even if a central scotoma is present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.76(b). However, when the lens required to correct distance vision in the poorer eye differs by more than three diopters from the lens required to correct distance vision in the better eye (and the difference is not due to congenital or developmental refractive error), and either the poorer eye or both eyes are service connected, evaluate the visual acuity of the poorer eye using either its uncorrected or corrected visual acuity, whichever results in better combined visual acuity. Id.

Diagnostic Code 6066 provides disability ratings where vision in one eye (the poorer eye) is 10/200 or better. Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 10/200, a 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 50 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200. An 80 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 15/200. A 90 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 10/200. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 15/200, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200. An 80 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 15/200. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/200, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/100, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. A 50 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/70, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/50, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40. A 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/40, a noncompensable disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40 or better. Id.

For evaluations of restrictions in visual field(s), the examiner must use either Goldmann kinetic perimetry or automated perimetry using Humphrey Model 750, Octopus Model 101, or later versions of these perimetric devices with simulated kinetic Goldmann testing capability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.77.

Determination of the average concentric contraction of the visual field of each eye by measuring the remaining visual field (in degrees) at each of the eight principal meridians 45 degrees apart, adding them, and dividing the sum by eight. 38 C.F.R. § 4.77(b). To determine the evaluation for visual impairment when both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, separately evaluate the visual acuity and visual field defect (expressed as a level of visual acuity), and combine them under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.

Diagnostic Code 6080 provides disability ratings where there is a defect to the visual field. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79. Under Diagnostic Code 6080, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 46 to 60 degrees bilaterally, contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 16 to 60 degrees unilaterally, or the loss of the superior half or nasal half of the visual field bilaterally. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6080. A 20 percent disability rating may be awarded for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 6 to 15 degrees unilaterally. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79. A 30 percent disability rating may be awarded for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining visual field of 31 to 45 degrees bilaterally, contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 5 degrees unilaterally, or loss of the temporal or inferior half of the visual field bilaterally. Id. A 50 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 16 to 30 degrees bilaterally. Id. A 70 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 6 to 15 degrees bilaterally. Id. Finally, a 100 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 5 degrees. Id.

For evaluations of restrictions in muscle functions, the examiner must use a Goldmann perimeter chart or the Tangent Screen method that identifies the four major quadrants (upward, downward, left, and right lateral) and the central field (20 degrees or less). The examiner must document the results of muscle function testing by identifying the quadrant(s) and range(s) of degrees in which diplopia exists. 38 C.F.R. § 4.78(a).

38 C.F.R. § 4.78(b) provides that (1) an evaluation for diplopia will be assigned to only one eye. When a veteran has both diplopia and decreased visual acuity or visual field defect, assign a level of corrected visual acuity for the poorer eye (or the affected eye, if the disability of only one eye is service-connected) that is: one step poorer than it would otherwise warrant if the evaluation for diplopia under diagnostic code 6090 is 20/70 or 20/100; two steps poorer if the evaluation under diagnostic code 6090 is 20/200 or 15/200; or three steps poorer if the evaluation under diagnostic code 6090 is 5/200. This adjusted level of corrected visual acuity, however, must not exceed a level of 5/200. Use the adjusted visual acuity of the poorer eye (or the affected eye, if the disability of one eye is service-connected), and the corrected visual acuity for the better eye (or visual acuity of 20/40 for the other eye, if only one eye is service-connected) to determine the percentage evaluation for visual impairment under diagnostic codes 6065 through 6066. (2) When diplopia extends beyond more than one quadrant or range of degrees, evaluate diplopia based on the quadrant and degree range that provides the highest evaluation. (3) When diplopia exists in two separate areas of the same eye, increase the equivalent visual acuity under diagnostic code 6090 to the next poorer level of visual acuity, not to exceed 5/200.

A June 2023 VA examination reveals that the Veteran had open-angle glaucoma and pinguecula. Diplopia was not found.

The Veteran's average concentric contraction of the visual field of each eye results in a right eye contraction of 39.625 degrees and left eye contraction of 34.375 degrees.

Based on the evidence above, a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for the Veteran's loss of visual acuity and loss of visual field is not warranted.

The Veteran's visual acuity of 20/100 corrected distance bilaterally warrants a 50 percent disability rating. Additionally, the Veteran's average contraction of the visual field of 31 to 45 degrees bilaterally warrants a 30 percent disability rating. Combining the Veteran's results for visual acuity disability rating of 50 percent disabling and contraction of visual field disability rating of 30 percent results in a combined disability rating of 70 percent disabling.

Accordingly, the preponderance of the most probative evidence is against the claim of entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for a loss of visual acuity and impairment of visual field. In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim, the doctrine is not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right elbow disorder is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left elbow disorder is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his bilateral elbow condition is related to his active duty service or his exposure to burn pits and other toxins. 

In the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of bilateral elbow conditions. See VA Examination August 4, 2023.  The AOJ also conceded the Veteran participating in a toxic exposure activity (TERA) based on his active duty service in Afghanistan and exposure to burn pits. As the record is devoid of clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). At issue in this case is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's bilateral elbow condition and his active duty service, to include his service in Afghanistan and his exposure to burn pits.

In a August 2023 VA examination, the Veteran stated that he began experiencing pain in his elbows and forearms in 2018 due to overuse.  While he has self treated the pain with Ibuprofen, it has continued to get worse over time and now the pain limits his ability to perform repetitive activities e.g. firm holding, forceful pushing or pulling, and heavy lifting or carrying.   Despite the Veteran describing pain associated with certain physical functions that involve his elbows, the examiner indicated that there were no flare-ups. 

The Board is aware that there are no specific elbow injuries or treatment noted in the Veteran's service treatment records. However, the Veteran's treatment records document numerous difficulties with his shoulder, arms and wrist, many of which required treatment. Given the nature of these conditions and their obvious and likely relationship to the Veteran's claimed bilateral elbow condition, the AOJ was obligated to develop whether treated injuries to the Veteran's shoulders, arms, and wrists involved either elbow.  At a minimum, this should have been addressed by the examiner in the September 2023 VA examination.  The failure to do so, renders the examination and corresponding opinion insufficient for adjudication. 

With regards to the skin disorder, the Veteran contends that his skin condition is related to his active duty service that includes his exposure to burn pits and other toxins.

In the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran participated in at least one toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) based on his service in Afghanistan and his exposure to burn pits. As the record is devoid of clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Despite these favorable findings and the Veteran's contention, no TERA examination was provided. Although the AOJ found that the Veteran had no diagnosis for a skin disorder, the Veteran is competent to provide evidence of what he experiences, including his symptomatology and medical history. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). The Veteran is competent to report what he experienced. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In particular, a skin disorder is easily capable of lay observation.

VA will provide a medical examination or obtain a medical opinion where there is: (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with a veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence to make a decision on the claim. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 82-83 (2006); 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4) (2011).

The threshold to for obtaining a medical examination is low. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). The Veteran warrants VA examinations.

For at least the above stated reasons, the Board finds that medical opinions for all three claims are warranted.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Return the claims file to a VA examiner of appropriate expertise in order to determine the etiology of the Veteran's skin disorder.

The VA examiner must provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's disorder is related to or otherwise caused by a TERA. In providing this opinion, the VA examiner is requested to determine and consider the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and service, as well as the synergistic and combined effect of all TERA.

A complete rationale for any opinion expressed should be provided in a report.

2. Return the claims file to a VA examiner of appropriate expertise in order to determine the etiology of the Veteran's bilateral elbow disorder. The VA examiner must answer whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e. the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's bilateral elbow disorder is directly related to service.

A complete rationale for any opinion expressed should be provided in a report.
