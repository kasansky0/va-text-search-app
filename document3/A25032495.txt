ORDER

The reduction of the Veteran's evaluation for bilateral plantar fasciitis from 30 percent disabling to 10 percent disabling, effective January 17, 2023, was improper; and the rating is restored.  

Entitlement to an increased disability rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral plantar fasciitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The March 2023 rating decision that reduced the Veteran's disability rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis from 30 to 10 percent disabling, effective January 17, 2023, failed to apply the correct statutory and regulatory provisions for reduced ratings.

2. Throughout the entire review period the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis has not been manifested by loss of use of the feet or foot.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The reduction of the rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis from 30 percent disabling to 10 percent disabling, was improper; and, the 30 percent disability rating is restored effective January 17, 2023.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276.

2. The criteria for an increased rating in excess of 30 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.14, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5276.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1998 to October 2000.

The rating decision on appeal was issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in March 2023.  The Veteran appealed this rating decision by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in April 2023.  He elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Within his VA Form 10182, the Veteran submitted a statement detailing his various contentions with respect to the claims on appeal.  This statement, while primarily comprised of argument, also included new lay evidence.  In Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that new evidence submitted with a VA Form 10182 on which the Direct Review option is selected creates uncertainty as to which Board review option the claimant intended, triggering the Board's duty to seek clarification under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (f).  The Court reasoned, in-part, that consideration must be given to the "full context within which [Veterans'] submissions are made" including liberally construing the filings of pro se claimants.  Id. (citing Rivera v. Shinseki, 654 F.3d 1377, 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011)).

In accordance with the Court's holding in Edwards, the Board provided notice to the Veteran on January 16, 2025 that the evidence submitted within his April 2023  VA Form 10182 could not be considered.  Although the time period for requesting a docket switch (to the Evidence Submission or Hearing docket) has passed, the Veteran was notified that he could submit a request for an extension of time to switch dockets with a showing of good cause.  No response to this letter was received, and the Board will, therefore, proceed with a decision in this case utilizing the Veteran's original Direct Review docket selection.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, as an initial matter, the Board will address the reduction and increased rating claims for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis. Generally, an appeal regarding the reduction of a rating must address only the propriety of the reduction, and not whether the Veteran is entitled to a higher rating.  Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 279-80 (1992).  However, when filing a claim with VA, claimants are presumed to be seeking the maximum available benefit for their disability.  See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993).  In situations where the reduction stems from a claim for a higher rating, the appeal may encompass not only the propriety of the reduction, but also the underlying claim for a higher rating.  Here, the reduction of the Veteran's bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis stemmed from the Veteran's claim for increase.  See December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  Therefore, the Board also has jurisdiction over the increased rating claim, and it is addressed below.

?

1. Entitlement to Restoration of a 30 Percent Disability Rating for Bilateral Foot, Plantar Fasciitis

The Veteran was initially assigned a noncompensable disability rating for bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, effective December 4, 2013, see August 2014 rating decision.  The Veteran's rating was later increased to 10 percent disabling, effective September 4, 2020, see October 2020 rating decision; and in a November 2020 rating decision, the AOJ assigned an increased 30 percent evaluation effective October 27, 2020.  

In December 2022, the Veteran submitted a new claim which included a request for an increased rating for bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis.  In the March 2023 decision on appeal, the AOJ then reduced the Veteran's evaluation from 30 percent to 10 percent, effective January 17, 2023.  

To properly reduce a rating, VA must meet both procedural and substantive benchmarks.  

When a disability rating has been in effect for 5 years of more, there is a heightened standard of review that must be applied when reducing that rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c).  For ratings that have been in effect for less than 5 years, 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c) allows for reduction when reexamination shows improvement in the disability.  See also Smith v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 339 (1993).  Here, the Veteran was assigned a 30 percent rating for bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, from October 27, 2020, and, therefore, the rating was in effect for less than 5 years.

When a reduction in the rating of a service-connected disability is contemplated and the lower rating would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons.  First there must be a rating action proposing the reduction and giving the Veteran 60 days to submit additional evidence and request a predetermination hearing.  If a hearing is not requested, and reduction is considered to be still warranted, a rating action will be taken to effectuate the reduction.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e), (i) (2).  The effective date of the reduction will be the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the Veteran of the final action expires.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e), (i) (2) (i).

In the March 2023 decision on appeal, the AOJ reduced [without first proposing a reduction] the Veteran's evaluation for bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, from 30 percent to 10 percent, effective January 17, 2023.  The rating decision also increased the evaluation assigned for migraine disability (from 30 percent disabling to 50 percent disabling) effective December 21, 2022.  This resulted in an increase in the combined rating for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities to 70 percent effective December 21, 2022, which was an increase from the 60 percent combined rating (effective since October 27, 2020). However, as a consequence to the reduction in rating assigned for the bilateral plantar fasciitis, the Veteran's total combined rating was reduced from 70 to 60 percent from January 17, 2023 (the effective date of the reduction at issue).  Consequently, the rating reduction at issue resulted in reduced compensation payments to the Veteran beginning on January 17, 2023.  See March 2023 Award Print.  

Generally speaking, if a rating decision reduces the rating for a disability, but at the same time awards service connection or an increased rating for another disability which effectively cancels out the effect of the reduction on the Veteran's combined disability rating, the notice mandated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) is not required. VAOPGCPREC 71-91 (Nov. 7, 1991).  Here, while there was a reduction in the rating for the bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, due to the other service connection grant, that reduction did not result in a decrease in the Veteran's compensation.  In other words, if not for the reduction of the bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, from 30 percent to 10 percent effective January 17, 2023, the Veteran would have been in receipt of an increased combined rating of 70 percent as opposed to continuing the combined 60 percent rating that started October 27, 2020.  Thus, the question becomes whether this purely retroactive award of a combined 70 percent rating, which then fell back to 60 percent as of the effective date of the reduction, triggered the duty to comply with 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e).  

In interpreting 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e), both the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) and VA General Counsel have recognized that the notice and 60-day grace period required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) are largely economically motivated, as opposed to being rooted in legal due process. O'Connell v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 89, 93 (2007) (citing the legislative history of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e)); VAOPGCPREC 71-91 (Nov. 7, 1991).  Based on the reasoning that 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) is largely designed to notify Veterans in advance of a pending reduction in their monthly compensation so that they may either prepare accordingly or contest the reduction, CAVC has determined that the due process required in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) does not apply in some situations where a Veteran was retroactively and temporarily assigned a higher combined rating, and then reduced back down to the rating assigned prior to the increase. Specifically, CAVC has found that the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) do not apply to staged ratings where the Veteran is granted an increased rating and then simultaneously staged down or to the award of temporary total ratings under 38 C.F.R. § 4.29 or 38 C.F.R. § 4.30.  O'Connell, 21 Vet. App. at 93-94.  Thus, to this point 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) has not been considered to apply to retroactive awards of combined or individual 100 percent ratings, as long as the Veteran is returned to at least the level of compensation he was at prior to the temporary increase. O'Connell, 21 Vet. App. at 93.

For these reasons, and based on the procedural history outlined, the Board finds that compliance with the notice provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) was not required in this matter.

Nevertheless, the Board finds that VA did not properly follow the regulations pertaining to the reduction of the evaluation assigned for bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, and the 30 percent rating is restored.

Several VA regulations are applicable to all rating-reduction cases.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1 and 4.2, VA is required in any rating-reduction case to ascertain, based upon review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based upon thorough examinations.  When any change in evaluation is to be made, the rating agency should ensure that there has been an actual change in the conditions, and not merely a difference in the thoroughness of the examination or in the use of descriptive terms.  38 C.F.R. § 4.13.  Additionally, VA must not only determine that an improvement in a disability has occurred, but also that that improvement actually reflects an improvement in the ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

Historically, the Veteran's service-connected bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, was originally rated by analogy under Diagnostic Code 5276 (flatfoot acquired).  See August 2014, October 2020, and November 2020 rating decision code sheets.  

Under Diagnostic Code 5276, a 30 percent rating is assigned for bilateral severe pes planus, defined as pes planus with objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indications of swelling on use with characteristic callosities.  A 50 percent rating is assigned for bilateral pes planus that is pronounced, defined as with marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo Achillis on manipulation that is not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276 (in effect prior to February 7, 2021).

In effectuating the reduction, the AOJ changed the diagnostic code used to rate the Veteran's bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, from Diagnostic Code 5276 (flatfoot acquired) to Diagnostic Code 5269 (plantar fasciitis).  See March 2023 rating decision code sheet.  On this point, the Court has held that when a disability is specifically listed in the Rating Schedule, such as plantar fasciitis was beginning on February 7, 2021, it may not be rated by analogy.  Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337-38 (2015).  In fact, the Federal Circuit expressly adopted this approach in Scott v. Wilkie, 920 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2019).

The Board is cognizant of the recent changes to the Rating Schedule that addresses the musculoskeletal system and muscle injuries, which are effective February 7, 2021.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453 (Nov. 30, 2020) (codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a).  One such change added a new Diagnostic Code 5269, to account for plantar fasciitis of the foot.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76464 (Nov. 30, 2020) (codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a).  The new rating criteria may only be applied prospectively from the effective date of the change forward (February 7, 2021 forward) since the regulatory change does not have a provision for retroactive application. See VAOPGCPREC 3-2000 (Apr. 10, 2000); Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

Under the new Diagnostic Code 5269, which pertains to plantar fasciitis, a 10 percent rating is assigned for unilateral or bilateral plantar fasciitis.  A 20 percent rating is assigned when there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis of one foot (unilateral).  A 30 percent rating is assigned when there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis of both feet (bilateral).  According to Note (1) to Diagnostic Code 5269, a maximum 40-percent rating is assigned for actual loss of use of the foot. According to Note (2) to Diagnostic Code 5269, if a Veteran has been recommended for surgical intervention, but is not a surgical candidate, plantar fasciitis is to be evaluated under the 20 percent or 30 percent criteria, whichever is applicable.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

The November 2020 rating decision, that assigned the 30 percent evaluation for bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, effective October 27, 2020, was based on a November 2020 VA foot conditions examination wherein the Veteran reported symptoms including severe pain, cramping, swelling, and extreme tenderness of the surfaces of the feet.  As to functional loss, he reported pain with prolonged standing and walking that is mitigated by orthotic use.  On examination, the Veteran's plantar fasciitis was noted to result in disturbance of locomotion and interference with standing.  The examiner indicated the Veteran's bilateral foot disability would not impact upon his ability to work.  

The March 2023 decision on appeal that reduced the evaluation for plantar fasciitis from 30 percent to 10 percent under the new Diagnostic Code 5269 for plantar fasciitis, was based on the findings of a January 2023 VA foot conditions examination. 

The January 2023 VA foot conditions examination records the Veteran's reported symptoms associated with his plantar fasciitis included intense, sharp, stabbing pain that starts at the heels, and goes through the arches, with occasional numbness.  He reported stiffening when stationary for long periods.   He reported increased pain with driving and repetitive overuse.  He reported the pain is alleviated by elevating and using ice.  He reported that pain, at its worst, is "8/10," and that when it reaches "10/10," he must get off his feet.  He reported that he must always wear shoes.  His current treatment included Barefoot Science shoe inserts; stretches; foot shiatsu massager; acupuncture; ice and elevation; and sometimes heat.  

As to functional loss, the Veteran reported decreased mobility and that he cannot move with normal strength, speed, or excursion to participate in physical activity or physically demanding work tasks.  He reported his mobility "is definitely less than it used to be. Can't hike; if I go to the park with my family I end up sitting on the bench stretching my feet."

On examination, the Veteran's plantar fasciitis was noted to chronically compromise weightbearing, and result in less movement than normal; disturbance of locomotion; pain, fatigue, weakness, and lack of endurance.  He did not require arch supports, custom orthotic inserts, or shoe modifications.  No assistive devices are used for his right or left foot with the exception of insoles.  The examiner indicated that non-surgical treatment did not relieve the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis symptoms.  

As to occupational impact, the examiner indicated the Veteran had lost "0-1" week work time in the last 12 months, as well as noting the Veteran's report of certain things he can and can't do at work, to include physically demanding work tasks.

Importantly, the Veteran had not undergone surgical treatment for his bilateral plantar fasciitis, nor was he recommended for surgical treatment, but was not a surgical candidate.  This is supportive of only a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5269 (plantar fasciitis).  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  A higher 20 percent rating would only be warranted under Diagnostic Code 5269 when there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment, unilateral, which was not the case here.  Id.  The AOJ in the March 2023 rating decision no longer considered the previously applied rating criteria by analogy for Diagnostic Code 5276 (flatfoot acquired).

Under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.951 (a), a readjustment to the Schedule for Rating Disabilities shall not be grounds for reduction of a disability rating in effect on the date of the readjustment, unless medical evidence establishes that the disability to be evaluated has actually improved.  In other words, a rating cannot be reduced from 30 percent to 10 percent solely on the basis of changed or amended rating criteria.  In this instant case, the AOJ reduced the Veteran's rating from 30 percent to 10 percent for his bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, due to the new rating criteria listed under Diagnostic Code 5269.  See again 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76464 (Nov. 30, 2020) (codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a).  However, the Board finds that this February 7, 2021 readjustment to the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (i.e., the addition of Diagnostic Code 5269 to address plantar fasciitis of the foot) shall not be grounds for reduction on the date of the readjustment from the previous 30 percent to the current 10 percent disability rating. The medical evidence fails to establish that the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis disability had improved.  More exactly, the mere change in the rating criteria by adding Diagnostic Code 5269 for plantar fasciitis did not reflect an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work, when considering his actual bilateral foot symptomatology.  

The reduction of the Veteran's rating was improper as there was no actual evidence of any change in the disability.  The findings at the November 2020 examination and at the January 2023 examination are nearly identical, with the only difference that the symptoms of swelling and extreme tenderness of the surfaces of the feet seems to have lessened, while another symptom (pain) had increased with resultant impact on his mobility and upon his ability to perform physically demanding work tasks.  This touches directly on the question of how this disorder has affected the Veteran's life and work, and it certainly does not suggest that his ability to function had improved.  The Board finds no indication in any of the evidence of record that the Veteran experienced improvement in his bilateral plantar fasciitis disability nor that there was a change in symptomatology that actually reflects an improvement in the ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. 

The AOJ also made no findings in its reduction decision regarding whether an improvement had occurred or how it impacted the Veteran's life and work.  While perhaps the AOJ decreased this rating based on a change in the rating criteria, this was not accompanied by any functional improvement in the Veteran's bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis.  His bilateral plantar fasciitis continued to cause significant disruption to his life and work according to the clinical evidence of record.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.344.

When VA has reduced a Veteran's rating without observing applicable laws and regulation, such a rating is void ab initio and should be set aside as not in accordance with the law.  Kitchens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 320, 325 (1995).  The Board finds that the AOJ failed to ascertain, based upon review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflected an actual change in the disability and whether there had been improvement in the ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  The Board, therefore, concludes that the March 2023 rating decision did not appropriately apply the regulations pertaining to reduction of ratings, the reduction was improper, and the prior rating should be restored.  

Accordingly, the 30 percent disability rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis is restored effective January 17, 2023.

2. Entitlement to an Increased Disability Rating in Excess of 30 Percent for Bilateral Plantar Fasciitis

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body, to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required.  Where an increase in the disability rating, rather than the propriety of the initial rating, is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance, and past medical reports should not take precedence over current findings.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Regardless of whether an appeal stems from disagreement with the initial rating assigned following an award of service connection or from disagreement with the rating assigned following a claim for increase, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007) (citing Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999)).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Further, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.3 explicitly mandate resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in favor of the claimant.  An approximate balance of the evidence includes but is not limited to equipoise.  Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1394-95 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Evidence is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Id.

The 30 percent disability rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis has been restored.  As herein, in the March 2023 decision on appeal, the AOJ changed the diagnostic code used to rate the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis from Diagnostic Code 5276 (flatfoot acquired) to Diagnostic Code 5269 (plantar fasciitis).  

On this point, the Court has held that when a disability is specifically listed in the Rating Schedule, such as plantar fasciitis was beginning on February 7, 2021, it may not be rated by analogy.  Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337-38 (2015).  In fact, the Federal Circuit expressly adopted this approach in Scott v. Wilkie, 920 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  Diagnostic Code 5276 (flatfoot acquired) will not be addressed for that reason.  Additionally, the evidence of record does not reflect that the Veteran has any other service-connected foot disabilities that would warrant a separate rating under a different diagnostic code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Under the new Diagnostic Code 5269, which pertains to plantar fasciitis, a 10 percent rating is assigned for unilateral or bilateral plantar fasciitis.  A 20 percent rating is assigned when there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis of one foot (unilateral).  A 30 percent rating is assigned when there is no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment for plantar fasciitis of both feet (bilateral).  According to Note (1) to Diagnostic Code 5269, a maximum 40-percent rating is assigned for actual loss of use of the foot.  According to Note (2) to Diagnostic Code 5269, if a Veteran has been recommended for surgical intervention, but is not a surgical candidate, plantar fasciitis is to be evaluated under the 20 percent or 30 percent criteria, whichever is applicable.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

The intent of the Rating Schedule is to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints due to healed injury as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint, even in the absence of arthritis, to include in situations where the disability at issue is not evaluated based on range of motion measurements.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59; Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011); Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346 (2016).

Under VA regulations, "loss of use" of a foot is defined as no effective function remaining other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation stump at the site of election below the knee with use of a suitable prosthetic appliance.  The determination will be made on the basis of the actual remaining function, whether the acts of balance, propulsion, etc., in the case of a foot, could be accomplished equally well by an amputation stump with prosthesis.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350 (a) (2) (i), 4.63.

Examples under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a) (2) which constitute loss of use of a foot include extremely unfavorable ankylosis of the knee, complete ankylosis of two major joints of an extremity, shortening of the lower extremity of 3-1/2 inches or more, and complete paralysis of the external popliteal (common peroneal) nerve and consequent foot-drop, accompanied by characteristic organic changes including trophic and circulatory disturbances and other concomitants confirmatory of complete paralysis of that nerve.  See also 38 C.F.R. § 4.63.

Under Diagnostic Code 8521, complete paralysis of the common peroneal nerve encompasses foot drop and slight droop of the first phalanges of all toes, an inability to dorsiflex the foot, loss of extension (dorsal flexion) of the proximal phalanges of the toes, loss of abduction of the foot, weakened adduction of the foot, and anesthesia covering the entire dorsum of the foot and toes.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

In Tucker v. West, 11 Vet. App. 369, 373 (1999), the Court stated that the relevant inquiry concerning loss of use is not whether amputation is warranted, but whether the claimant has had effective function remaining other than that which would be equally well-served by an amputation with use of a suitable prosthetic appliance. The Court also stated that in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.40, the Board is required to consider the impact of pain in making its decision and to articulate how pain on use was factored into its decision.  Id.  In Jensen v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 66, 78-79 (2017), the Court clarified that the standard for "loss of use of the feet" under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350 (a) (2) (i) and 4.63 is not the same as "loss of use of the lower extremities" for purposes of entitlement to specially adapted housing under 38 C.F.R. § 3.809 (b).  That is, "loss of use of the feet" for SMC purposes is a more stringent standard for a Veteran to meet than "loss of use of the lower extremities."  Id. 

The evidence of record does not warrant an increased rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  In making this determination, the Board has considered both the lay and medical evidence of record.

The evidentiary record includes a January 2023 VA nursing note reflecting that the Veteran's gait was normal, and that he ambulated into the exam room with steady gait and without assistance.

The Veteran was provided a VA examination for foot conditions in January 2023.  He was diagnosed with bilateral plantar fasciitis.  He described symptoms including intense, sharp, stabbing pain that starts at the heels, goes through the arches, with occasional numbness.  He reported stiffening when stationary for long periods.   He reported increased pain with driving and repetitive overuse.  He reported the pain is alleviated by elevating and using ice.  He reported that pain, at its worst, is "8/10," and that when it reaches "10/10," he must get off his feet.  He reported that must always wear shoes.  His current treatment included Barefoot Science shoe inserts; stretches; foot shiatsu massager; acupuncture; ice and elevation; and sometimes heat.  

As to functional loss, the Veteran reported decreased mobility and that he cannot move with normal strength, speed, or excursion to participate in physical activity or physically demanding work tasks.  He reported his mobility "is definitely less than it used to be. Can't hike; if I go to the park with my family I end up sitting on the bench stretching my feet."

The examiner indicated that non-surgical treatment did not relieve the Veteran's bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis, symptoms.  It also demonstrates that he has not undergone surgical treatment for his bilateral plantar fasciitis, nor was he recommended for surgical treatment, but was not a surgical candidate.  On examination, the Veteran's bilateral foot, plantar fasciitis was noted to chronically compromise weightbearing, and result in less movement than normal; disturbance of locomotion; pain, fatigue, weakness, and lack of endurance.  He did not require arch supports, custom orthotic inserts, or shoe modifications.  No assistive devices are used for his right or left foot, with the exception of insoles.

As to occupational impact, the examiner indicated the Veteran had lost "0-1" week work time in last 12 months, as well as noting the Veteran's report of certain things he can and can't do at work, to include physically demanding work tasks.

This medical evidence, along with the VA treatment records do not provide a basis for a rating higher than 30 percent under Diagnostic Code 5269, that is, this evidence does not indicate that the Veteran's service-connected bilateral plantar fasciitis manifests in actual "loss of use" of the feet or its functional equivalent.  The Veteran also does not have any right or left foot drop.  Indeed, the Veteran does not have any of the examples listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a) (2) and 38 C.F.R. § 4.63 which could constitute "loss of use" of the right or left foot.  

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements of pain on use of feet, decreased mobility, and that when his pain increases to "10/10," he must get off his feet.  While these medical reports show severe problems with the bilateral feet, they do not tend to show no effective function; for example, the Veteran does not use any assistive devices for his right or left foot (no cane, no brace, no crutches, no wheelchair, no walker), except insoles.  Moreover, the Veteran's VA treatment records reflect his gait is normal, and that he ambulated into the exam room with steady gait and without assistance.  See January 2023 VA nursing note.  Thus, the Veteran's effective functioning far exceeds what he might expect with amputation and a suitable prosthetic appliance(s) for the right and left foot and leg.  Tucker, 11 Vet. App. at 373.

Consideration under Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, __ Vet. App. __ (March 12, 2025), is not necessary.  The Veteran reports use of insoles which alleviate pain on weightbearing. However, in order to warrant a higher (40 percent) rating for bilateral plantar fasciitis under Diagnostic Code 5269, there needs to evidence showing foot drop.  The evidence reflects that the Veteran retains the ability to ambulate with a steady gait.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that the Veteran would experience foot drop in the absence of his use of the insoles.  

Accordingly, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an increased rating in excess of 30 percent for bilateral plantar fasciitis under Diagnostic Code 5269.

The Board has considered the Veteran's claim and decided entitlement based on the evidence.  The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record with respect to his claim, to include entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU), or entitlement to an extraschedular disability rating.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
