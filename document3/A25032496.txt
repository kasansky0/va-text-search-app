DOCKET NO. 240726-458804
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of December 6, 2017, but no earlier, for service connection for hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam and was exposed to herbicide agents during his service, and therefore his hypertension was incurred in service.

2. The Veteran filed an Intent to File (ITF) on December 6, 2017, and his VA Form 21-526EZ seeking service connection for hypertension was received on March 29, 2018, within one year of VA's receipt of his ITF. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of December 6, 2017, but no earlier, for service connection for hypertension have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1968 to January 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO). 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, which was later subject to HLR.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that it has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record in conjunction with this case. However, the Board has limited its discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008). Thus, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim on appeal.

1. Entitlement to an effective date of December 6, 2017, but no earlier, for service connection for hypertension is granted.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. §3.400.

On August 10, 2022, the President signed into law the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). A provision of the PACT Act provided that hypertension is now a disability that can be presumptively service-connected due to herbicide exposure. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e). The Board notes that, generally, claims granted under the PACT Act will be effective no earlier than August 10, 2022, the date of its enactment.

In this case, the RO's February 2023 rating decision granted the Veteran service connection for hypertension associated with herbicide exposure, effective August 10, 2022, the earliest date of entitlement under the PACT Act. The rating decision on appeal continued the effective date of August 10, 2022, for the Veteran's service-connected hypertension.  

Although the Veteran is now service connected for hypertension on a presumptive basis, effective August 10, 2022, VA must address other avenues of entitlement to service connection, including on a direct or presumptive basis based on exposure to herbicides prior to the PACT Act. A finding of direct or secondary service connection on a facts-found basis is more favorable than presuming such exposure pursuant to the PACT Act. As a result, an effective date before August 10, 2022, may be awarded. Therefore, the Board will consider whether service connection is warranted under any other theory of entitlement on a direct or secondary basis.

There is no dispute that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hypertension. Further, a June 2020 VA Memorandum concedes that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during his military service based upon the Veteran's duty or visitation (boots on ground) in the Republic of Vietnam. Therefore, service connection for hypertension on a direct causation basis, without consideration of the PACT Act, is warranted. 

The Board notes that there is positive evidence in VA's possession to support granting the Veteran's claim for hypertension. For example, a 2014 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Report (2014 NAS Update) found "limited or suggestive evidence of association" between hypertension and herbicide agent exposure. In a 2018 NAS Update, hypertension was elevated from the "limited or suggestive evidence" category to the "sufficient evidence of an association" category. Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 11 (2018), available at https://www.nap.edu/read/25137/chapter/1, pages 465, 560, 565.

Although the record does not include the 2014 and 2018 NAS reports, these are within the Board's constructive possession, as VA provided support in developing these reports and are highly relevant. Euzebio v. McDonough, 989 F.3d 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that the VA is in constructive possession of documents that are relevant and reasonably connected to the claim).

Accordingly, as there is "sufficient evidence of an association," indicating that there is enough epidemiologic evidence "to conclude that there is a positive association" between hypertension and herbicide agent exposure, the Board finds that service connection is warranted on a direct basis, effective December 6, 2017, the date the VA received the Veteran's Intent to File (ITF).
