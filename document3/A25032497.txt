FINDING OF FACT

On March 11, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in this appeal, the Board received a statement from the Veteran and his representative requesting withdrawal of this appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal by the Veteran (or his or her authorized representative) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1995 to July 2014.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2021 rating decision which, in pertinent part, granted entitlement to an increased, 30 percent disability rating for a cervical spine disability, and an increased, 40 percent disability rating for a lumbar spine disability (both effective September 2, 2020) and denied entitlement to an increased disability rating in excess of 10 percent for a left knee disability. This rating decision was issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In September 2021, the Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 10182: Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals and elected to have a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). In January 2025, the Board sent the Veteran and his representative a letter, notifying them that the Veteran was scheduled for a virtual tele-hearing before a VLJ on March 25, 2024. See January 2025 BVA Letter.

However, prior to the scheduled hearing, the Veteran and his representative submitted a March 11, 2025 Statement in which the Veteran stated that he was satisfied with his current disability ratings, and requested a withdrawal of this appeal. See March 2025 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. The Board considers this communication to be a full withdrawal of the issues on appeal in this matter.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative. Id.

Based on the above, the Board finds that the Veteran has withdrawn the issues on appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
