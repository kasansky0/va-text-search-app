CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  From January 15, 2022, the criteria for a 20 percent initial evaluation for LLE sciatic nerve condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.124a, diagnostic code (DC) 8520.

2. From January 15, 2022, the criteria for a 20 percent initial evaluation for RLE sciatic nerve condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.124a, DC 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1989 to April 1998.

In June 2022, the regional office (RO) granted service connection for bilateral shoulder conditions with 20 percent evaluations, bilateral lower extremities radiculopathy with 10 percent evaluations, and non-compensable evaluations for bilateral shoulder scars, all effective in January 2022.  In June 2023, the Veteran filed a higher-level review for the appealed conditions and in July 2023 the RO denied the appealed conditions. In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected a Direct Review.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal was not considered.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider with respect to the appealed claims, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, because the Board is remanding the claims for increase evaluations of bilateral shoulders, shoulder scars, and lower extremity conditions, any evidence the Board could not consider with respect to these claims will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claims.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Increased Rating

Ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.  The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155. 

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C.A. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2009). 

After consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

1. A 20 percent initial evaluation for LLE nerve condition.

2. A 20 percent initial evaluation for RLE nerve condition.

The Veteran's LLE and RLE sciatic nerve conditions are evaluated as 10 percent disabling under DC 8520 from January 15, 2022.  The Veteran seeks higher initial evaluations.  

Under DC 8520, paralysis of sciatic nerve, an 80 percent rating for is warranted for complete paralysis; the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of the muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost.  Incomplete paralysis warrants a 60 percent rating for severe with marked muscular atrophy, a 40 percent rating for moderately severe symptoms, a 20 percent rating for moderate symptoms, and a 10 percent rating for mild symptoms.

38 C.F.R. § 4.124a defines the term "incomplete paralysis" as indicating a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.

The terms "mild," "moderate," and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just."  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  The use of terminology such as "moderate" or "severe" by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue.  All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Nevertheless, a rating should be mild, or at most, at the moderate degree where the nerve involvement is wholly sensory.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves, Note.  

The April 2022 VA medical examination revealed the Veteran's experiences moderate LLE and RLE symptoms with constant pain.  Additionally, the Veteran's uses medications to alleviate symptoms.  See non-VA medical treatment record (February 2022); VA medical examination (April 2022).  The examination findings constitute probative evidence in favor of the claims.  

Here, the probative evidence shows the Veteran's overall lower extremities sciatic nerve conditions, at least, more nearly approximates the criteria for moderate symptoms.  Further, the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  DC 8520 does not contemplate relief by medications.  

On balance, the probative evidence weighs in favor of an initial 20 percent evaluation for LLE and RLE radiculopathy conditions.  A 20 percent evaluation for LLE and RLE sciatic nerve conditions under DC 8520 from January 15, 2022, is warranted.  

The Board addresses initial evaluations greater than 20 percent for bilateral lower extremities in the remand section of this decision. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

This appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.  Remand by the Board in the AMA is proper for correction of a pre-decisional duty to assist errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

3. An initial evaluation more than 20 percent for LLE condition.

4. An initial evaluation more than 20 percent for RLE condition.

5. An initial evaluation more than 20 percent for left shoulder condition.

6. An initial evaluation more than 20 percent for right shoulder condition.

The Veteran's bilateral shoulder conditions are separately evaluated as 20 percent disabling under DC 5201 from January 2022.  Additionally, the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity conditions are separately evaluated as 20 percent disabling under DC 8520 from January 2022.  The Veteran seeks higher initial evaluations.

The Veteran underwent bilateral shoulder and lower extremity VA examinations in April 2022.  See VA medical examinations (April 2022).  However, the examiners did not adequately address the pertinent lay and medical evidence of record regarding the severity of the Veteran's bilateral shoulder and lower extremity conditions.  Moreover, the examiners did not provide an adequate medical opinion assessing the severity, flare ups, active and passive motion, and weight and non-weight bearing problems of the Veteran's bilateral shoulder and lower extremity conditions, throughout the appeal.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Sharp v. Shulkin,29 Vet. App. 26 (2017); Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  Consequently, as to the issues of increase evaluations more than 20 percent for bilateral shoulder and lower extremity conditions, the examinations are inadequate and provided minimal probative weight.  

The failure to provide an adequate examination and opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand to remedy.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

On remand, the examiner must provide a retrospective medical opinion discussing the severity of the Veteran's service-connected bilateral shoulder and lower extremity conditions, throughout the appeal.  See Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80, 85-86 (2008).  In doing so, the examiner must fully discuss the medical and lay evidence regarding the symptoms and impairment of the Veteran's service-connected bilateral shoulder and lower extremity conditions for the appealed period.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020).

7. A compensable initial evaluation for left shoulder scars.

8. A compensable initial evaluation for right shoulder scars.

The Veteran's bilateral shoulder scars are separately evaluated as non-compensable disabling under DC 7802 from January 2022.  The Veteran seeks higher initial evaluations.

The April 2022 bilateral shoulder VA examination noted three scars in each shoulder measuring 0.3x 0.3 cm.  See VA medical examination (April 2022).  However, the examiner did not adequately address the pertinent lay and medical evidence of record regarding the severity of the Veteran's bilateral shoulder scars, including if the scars are painful or unstable.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  Consequently, as to the issues of increase evaluations for bilateral shoulder scars, the examination is inadequate and provided minimal probative weight.  

The failure to provide an adequate examination and opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand to remedy.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

On remand, the examiner must provide a retrospective medical opinion discussing the severity, size, and quantity of the Veteran's service-connected bilateral shoulder scars, throughout the appeal.  See Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80, 85-86 (2008).  In doing so, the examiner must fully discuss the medical and lay evidence regarding the symptoms and impairment of the Veteran's service-connected bilateral shoulder scars for the appealed period, including if they are painful or unstable.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule VA examinations to assess the severity of the Veteran's service-connected bilateral lower extremity conditions, and bilateral shoulder conditions and scars. 

The examiner must review the entire claims file and this remand.

The examiner shall provide a full, retrospective description of the severity of the appealed conditions and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disabilities, throughout the appeal period.  

The examiner shall identify all functional impairment found to be present in the disabilities.  

In doing so, the examiner must specifically acknowledge and discuss the Veteran's medical history and competent lay reports regarding the severity of the appealed conditions.

The examiner shall describe any pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, instability of station, locking, active and passive motion, weight and non-weight bearing problems, and incoordination present for bilateral shoulder and lower extremity conditions. 

As to bilateral lower extremity conditions, the examiner must clarify if the Veteran suffers from other than wholly sensory symptoms, including paralysis or loss of use of the lower extremities.

As to bilateral shoulder scar conditions, the examiner must clarify the quantity, measurements, severity, and if the scars are painful or unstable. 

The examiner shall also state whether the examination is taking place during a period of flare-up.  If not, the examiner shall ask the Veteran to describe the flare-ups experienced, including frequency, duration, characteristics, precipitating and alleviating factors, severity and/or extent of functional impairment experienced during a flare-up of symptoms and/or after repeated use over time. 

Based on the Veteran's lay statements and the other evidence of record, the examiner will provide an opinion estimating any additional degrees of limited motion caused by functional loss during a flare-up or after repeated use over time. 

If unable to render a medical opinion, provide a statement as to whether there is any additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.  

If the examiner is unable to provide any requested opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain why this is so.
