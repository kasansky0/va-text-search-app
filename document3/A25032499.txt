DOCKET NO. 240711-453855
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

An effective date prior to March 1, 2023, for a 50 percent disability rating for migraines is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  On November 24, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking service connection for headaches.  In a March 2022 rating decision service connection for migraines was granted and rated as 10 percent disabling, effective the date of the claim.

2.  On March 1, 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim, seeking a higher disability rating for migraines.  

3.  The first evidence supporting the assignment of 50 percent rating for migraines is an April 2023 VA examination report.

4. In a May 2023 rating decision, an increased rating of 50 percent was assigned for migraines effective March 1, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than March 1, 2023, for the award of a 50 percent evaluation for migraines are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.400, 3.2500(h).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1994 to May 1997, from November 2001 to May 2002, and from June 2008 to May 2009.

In a November 2023, the rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied an earlier effective date for the 50 percent disability rating for migraines.  The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  See VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD).  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Effective Date

The Veteran is seeking an effective date earlier than March 1, 2023, for the assignment of a 50 percent disability rating for migraine disability.  

The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the application is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a),(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 12-98.  

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).

For appeals governed by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), as in this case, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or issue by timely and properly filing a supplemental claim request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals following notice of a decision by the AOJ.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1).  

On November 24, 2021, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526 seeking service connection for headaches.  Relevant evidence during the appeal period includes a January 2022 VA headaches examination and opinion where the examiner found the Veteran's migraines were proximately due to or the result of his service-connected tinnitus.  The examination findings show the Veteran described pulsating or throbbing head pain on both sides of the head with nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and changes in vision lasting less than one day and treated with over-the-counter (OTC) medications as needed.  He experienced characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine head pain, occurring once every two months.  The Veteran worked in security and reported the headaches impacted his ability to work due to difficulty with concentration, focus, and vision causing him to lose 1-2 weeks of work in the last 12 months.  The examiner found the headaches were not considered very prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The AOJ granted service connection for migraines on a secondary basis and assigned a 10 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100, effective the date the claim was received.

Under DC 8100, headaches with less frequent attacks are rated noncompensable (0 percent).  A 10 percent disability rating is warranted for characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over last several months.  A 30 percent disability rating is warranted for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months.  Very frequent, completely prostrating, and prolonged attacks (of migraine headaches) productive of severe economic inadaptability warrant a 50 percent disability rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

"Prostrating attacks" are not the same as headaches, or even severe headaches.  According to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 31st Edition (2007), p.1554, "prostration" is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  A similar definition is found in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition (2003), p.999, "prostration" is defined as "complete mental or physical exhaustion or collapse."  See Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 446 (2004).

In March 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim) seeking a higher disability rating based on new and relevant evidence.  In an accompanying statement he stated that his headaches no longer responded to OTC medications and that their severity has been the same since before he filed his initial claim in 2021.  See VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim dated March 1, 2023; see also November 2023 HLR Informal Conference Worksheet.  He also submitted private outpatient treatment records from February 2023 which document that he was prescribed medication for exertional headaches associated with exercise and sneezing and chronic migraines without aura that were not considered intractable.  See clinical clinic records from Swedish American Hospital/UW Health. 

Also of record is an April 2023 VA examination report.  The Veteran described headaches with pulsating/throbbing pain on both sides of the head, as well as nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, changes in vision, and sensory changes.  The duration of typical headache pain lasts less than a day.  The examiner indicated the Veteran had prostrating and prolonged attacks of headache pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.  In a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ awarded a 50 percent evaluation for migraines, effective March 1, 2023.

The Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursed his November 2021 claim by filing the VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim) within the period of time prescribed by applicable laws and regulations following the March 2022 rating decision.  Because he has continuously pursued his claim, he has preserved the earliest possible effective date of November 24, 2021.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1).  Consequently, the effective date of the grant of the 50 percent service connection for migraine disability is either the date the November 24, 2021 service connection claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

However, there are no clinical findings between November 24, 2021 and March 1, 2023, the appeal period in question, that show an increased severity of migraine symptoms, especially of such degree to warrant a 50 percent disability rating.  See Hazan, 10 Vet. App. at 519.  The Veteran's main contention appears to be that the evidence on which the 50 percent evaluation is based is the same evidence that was before VA in 2021.  However, in the context of determining whether an increase in severity was factually ascertainable, the Board finds this contention does not suffice.  

In this case, the Veteran's assertion that the severity of his migraines in 2021 is the same as in 2023, is directly contradicted by a comparison of the symptoms and thus lacks credibility.  VA outpatient treatment records prior to March 1, 2023, show he consistently reported treating his headaches with OTC medications with good results.  See VA Primary Care Nurse Note, dated November 30, 2009, VA Primary Care Notes, dated March 16, 2021 and April 9, 2021.  Also, during a neurology consultation, he noted that he does not have headaches when he first wakes up in the morning.  See VA Neurology Consult dated May 6, 2021.  There are no additional descriptions of the severity/intensity of headaches and no indication as to their frequency, duration, or impact on functioning to show symptoms that are more severe than those recorded on the January 2022 VA examination.  Moreover, the recent February 2023 private treatment record noted the Veteran's migraines were not intractable.  

Here, the first evidence supporting the assignment of a 50 rating is the April 2023 VA examination report, which indicates the Veteran's headaches were productive of severe economic inadaptability and on that basis the AOJ awarded the 50 percent rating under DC 8100.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  Therefore, April 2023 is the earliest date that it was factually ascertainable that an increase in migraines disability occurred to warrant the 50 percent current evaluation.  As previously noted, the effective date for the award of compensation is the date of claim or the date when entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Because the April 2023 VA examination report is dated after the November 2021 claim, it represents the proper effective date for the grant of a 50 percent evaluation for migraines.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
