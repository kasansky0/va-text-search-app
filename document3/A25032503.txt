DOCKET NO. 210813-179917
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for an effective date earlier than August 21, 2007, for the award of service connection for coronary artery disease is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 26, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran and his representative that a withdrawal of the appeal for an effective date earlier than August 21, 2007, for the award of service connection for coronary artery disease is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for an effective date earlier than August 21, 2007, for the award of service connection for coronary artery disease by Veteran and his representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1970 to October 1976 in the United States Marine Corps.

The May 2021 rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In August 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Hearing docket.  On March 26, 2025, he withdrew the hearing request.

1. The appeal for an effective date earlier than August 21, 2007, for the award of service connection for coronary artery disease is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  In the present case, the appellant and his authorized representative have withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
