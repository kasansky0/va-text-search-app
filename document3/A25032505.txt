DOCKET NO. 240814-464610
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for increased ratings for right hip, cervical spine, lumbar spine, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, right ankle, and left knee disabilities is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On December 9, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant (the Veteran) that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2011 to January 2016.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Board notes that on December 9, 2024, the Veteran indicated that he wanted to discharge his representative, Allen W. Gumpenberger. As the Veteran may revoke a power of attorney at any time, the Board accepts the Veteran's choice to terminate Mr. Gumpenberger's representation. See 38 C.F.R. § 16.631 (f)(1).

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
