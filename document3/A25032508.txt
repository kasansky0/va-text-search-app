ORDER

Service connection for sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's sleep apnea was clearly present during his 20 years of honorable military service, and diagnosed less than five months after separation.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2002 to July 2022.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran is seeking service connection for sleep apnea which he contends is related to his active service. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Here, the Veteran separated from service July 31, 2022 after more than 20 years of honorable service.  He was diagnosed with sleep apnea in December 2022, less than five months after separation.  

In a December 2022 statement, the Veteran reported that his sleep apnea was caused by an in-service incurrence. Specifically, he stated that, "I worked multiple night and swing shift hours during my combat deployments to Iraq (2007 and 2008-2009) in which I often felt tired throughout the day with multiple migraines and trouble focusing on work."  Note, the record shows that the Veteran was granted service connection for migraines in a November 2022 rating decision.

In December 2022, the Veteran's wife also provided a detailed statement regarding his condition. She advised that they met in 2008 and married in 2009. While sharing a room, she noted that he was restless at night, often had mood swings, and "had trouble making it throughout the day without feeling tired." Specifically, she stated that after his 2009 deployment in Iraq, he had "trouble falling and staying asleep, probably due to his inconsistent schedule, stressful working conditions and frequent rocket/mortar attacks." She further noted that when they Skyped, "he often talked about his irregular sleep pattern (night and mid-shifts)." Additionally, he informed her that the stress and trauma of serving in Iraq had caused an inability to maintain normal breathing during his sleep. Further, she stated that after his deployment, his sleeping patterns had worsened which impacted her sleeping patterns. She then went on to say that his sleep apnea was extremely frustrating because the constant sleep interruptions, non-stop movements, and snoring made it difficult to get a good night's sleep. She also noted that his sleep patterns led to moodiness and irritability during the day as well as tiredness. Even more, she reported that he woke up with headaches/migraines, and he was "extremely forgetful." In sum, the Veteran's wife reported that it was her belief that his sleep apnea disorder resulted from his irregular sleep schedule and mental distress while serving two combat deployments on active duty.

Service treatment records show that the Veteran complained of issues with falling or staying asleep on multiple occasions in 2021; in June 2022, he was referred for a sleep study. In November 2022, after his separation from service, the Veteran attended a sleep study and was diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea. 

In September 2022, the Veteran attended a VA examination to assess his mental health. During the examination, he reported experiencing severe anxiety, sleep problems, and loss of appetite during his 2007 deployment in Iraq. He also reported that he sought behavioral health support in 2009 within which he was diagnosed with adjustment disorder and prescribed Zoloft. He stated that he engaged in weekly therapy for approximately one and one half years just before retiring. The VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with other specified trauma and stressor related disorder. The examiner identified chronic sleep impairment as a symptom of his condition. 

The Veteran attended a January 2023 VA examination at which his previous sleep apnea diagnosis was confirmed. He reported that his condition began around 2007 or 2008. Specifically, he reported feeling tired and fatigued despite exercise and adequate hours of sleep. He also reported snoring but stated that this usually occurred when he slept on his back. Of note, the examiner did not provide a medical opinion, and the AOJ did not seek to remedy this omission. 

In January 2023, the Veteran attended a second VA examination to assess his mental health. In an associated report, the examiner noted symptoms of mild memory loss and chronic sleep impairment as related to the Veteran's disorder. The examiner opined that his sleep disturbances were subsumed under his service-connected psychiatric disorder. 

Having reviewed the evidence, the Board has no doubt that the Veteran's sleep apnea either began during, or was otherwise caused by his military service.  Accordingly, service connection for sleep apnea is granted.
