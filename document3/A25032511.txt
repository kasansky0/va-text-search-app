ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for a left posteromedial diaphragmatic defect and subsequent fat herniation associated with hernia, inguinal, left, operated residuals (hereinafter "left diaphragmatic defect associated with hernia") is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence shows that the Veteran's left diaphragmatic defect associated with hernia has not been manifested any symptoms that are not already attributed to other hernias. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial compensable disability rating for left diaphragmatic defect associated with hernia have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346-7338. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1958 to August 1962. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which granted service connection for a left diaphragmatic defect associated with hernia with a 0 percent rating effective October 6, 2021. 

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket appealing the assigned 0 percent rating for a left diaphragmatic defect associated with hernia. Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. The Schedule is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. When two evaluations are potentially applicable, VA will assign the higher evaluation when the disability more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. VA will resolve reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If the evidence for and against a claim is in equipoise, the claim will be granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 56 (1990). Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Each disability is viewed in relation to its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). The Board notes that where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2 (2016); see also Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). In Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007), however, the Court held that "staged ratings" are appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for a left posteromedial diaphragmatic defect and subsequent fat herniation associated with hernia, inguinal, left, operated residuals is denied.

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a 0 percent rating for his left diaphragmatic defect associated with hernia under DC 7346-7338. The Veteran contends that his diaphragmatic defect associated with hernia is more severe than what is contemplated by the currently assigned rating. 

In September 2024, the RO granted service connection for left diaphragmatic defect associated with hernia with a 0 percent rating effective October 6, 2021. The appeal period before the Board begins on October 6, 2021, the date of the claim for service connection.

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds an initial 10 percent rating, and no higher is warranted.

The Veteran's left diaphragmatic defect associated with hernia is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, hyphenated DC 7346-7338. Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one DC requires use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

The first of the hyphenated diagnostic codes... indicates" the system or bodily part being rated, and the second diagnostic code indicates the most closely analogous disease, injury or disability listed in the rating schedule. Archer v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 433 (1992); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20 provides for analogous rating "under a closely related disease or injury" and in determining whether disabilities are "closely related" the VA may consider the analogousness of (1) the "functions affected", (2) the "anatomical localization", and (3) the "symptomatology." All three factors must be addressed and not merely one factor, e.g., the analogousness of symptoms. Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 351 (1992) (in which the Court suggested that a rating may be made on the analogousness of causes rather than symptoms); see also Vogan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 159, 161 (2010).

During the course of this appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating digestive system disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 were amended, effective May 19, 2024. Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Digestive System, 89 Fed. Reg. 19735 (March 20, 2024) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a). These amendments revised certain diagnostic codes "to ensure that the rating schedule uses current medical terminology and provides detailed and updated criteria for evaluation of digestive conditions for disability rating purposes." Id. 

If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. Id. Therefore, where applicable, the Veteran's claims have been considered under the old criteria prior to May 19, 2024, and both the old and new rating criteria from May 19, 2024. The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran has been applied.

Prior to May 19, 2024, under DC 7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. The maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

The terms "severe impairment of health" and "considerable impairment of health" are not defined in the rating schedule; rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. However, the Board shall apply the ordinary meanings of the words. "Considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267 (11th ed. 2012). "Severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." Id. at 1140. Moreover, dysphagia is defined as difficulty in swallowing. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 587 (31st ed. 2007). Pyrosis is defined as heartburn. Id. at 1587. Hematemesis is defined as the vomiting of blood. Id. at 842. Melena is defined as the passage of dark-colored feces stained with blood pigments or with altered blood. Id. at 1142.

Prior to May 19, 2024, under DC 7338, a noncompensable (0 percent) rating is warranted for a hernia that is small, reducible, or without true hernia protrusion, or that is not operated but remediable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. A 10 percent rating is warranted for recurrent postoperative hernias, readily reducible and well supported by truss or belt. A 30 percent rating is warranted for small recurrent postoperative hernias or unoperated irremediable hernias, not well supported by truss, or not readily reducible. A 60 percent rating is warranted for large, recurrent postoperative hernias that are not well supported under ordinary conditions and not readily reducible when considered inoperable. A note clarifies that the adjudicator should add 10 percent for bilateral involvement, provided the second hernia is compensable. This means that the more severely disabling hernia is to be evaluated, and 10 percent, only, added for the second hernia, if the latter is of compensable degree.

The revised criteria effective May 19, 2024, contains a significantly different set of rating criteria. Effective May 19, 2024, DC 7346, provides rating criteria for hiatal hernia and paraesophageal hernia. The rating criteria directs that hiatal hernia and paraesophageal hernias be rated as stricture of esophagus under DC 7203. 

Effective May 19, 2024, under DC 7203, a noncompensable rating is warranted where there is a documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications; a 10 percent rating is warranted where there is a documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic. A 30 percent rating is warranted where there is a documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year. A 50 percent is warranted where there is a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement. A maximum 80 percent is warranted where there is a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube).

Note (4): Recurrent esophageal stricture is defined as the inability to maintain target esophageal diameter beyond 4 weeks after the target diameter has been achieved.

Note (5): Refractory esophageal stricture is defined as the inability to achieve target esophageal diameter despite receiving no fewer than 5 dilation sessions performed at 2-week intervals.

Effective May 19, 2024, DC 7338 was amended to provide a noncompensable disability rating for an asymptomatic hernia; present and repairable, or repaired. A 10 percent disability rating is assigned for an irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with hernia size smaller than 3 cm. A 20 percent disability rating is assigned for an irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with both of the following present for 12 months or more: (1) size equal to 3 cm or greater but less than 15 cm in one dimension; and (2) pain when performing one of the following activities: (1) bending over, (2) activities of daily living (ADLs), (3) walking, and (4) climbing stairs. A 30 percent disability rating is assigned for an irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with both of the following present for 12 months or more: (1) size equal to 3 cm or greater but less than 15 cm in one dimension; and (2) pain when performing two of the following activities: (1) bending over, (2) activities of daily living (ADLs), (3) walking, and (4) climbing stairs. A 60 percent disability rating is assigned for an irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with both of the following present for 12 months or more: (1) size equal to 15 cm or greater in one dimension; and (2) pain when performing two of the following activities: (1) bending over, (2) activities of daily living (ADLs), (3) walking, and (4) climbing stairs. A 100 percent rating is assigned for an irreparable hernia (new or recurrent) present for 12 months or more; with both of the following present for 12 months or more: (1) size equal to 15 cm or greater in one dimension; and (2) pain when performing three of the following activities: (1) bending over, (2) activities of daily living (ADLs), (3) walking, and (4) climbing stairs.

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2022. The Veteran complained of umbilical and inguinal pain that lasts all day and recurs every day and that worsened with long distance walking, going up and down the stairs, pushing, lifting and carrying heavy objects. He also experienced pyrosis, gastric reflux, and dysphagia due to his ventral (umbilical) hernia. There was no substernal or arm or shoulder pain present. The VA examiner marked that the Veteran has a small ventral hernia that was inoperable due to the Veteran's heart conditions. This hernia was readily reducible; however, not well supported by a truss or belt. The examiner remarked that the Veteran complained of a diaphragmatic hernia due to surgeon malpractice as a consequence of the umbilical laparoscopy approach to repair his left inguinal hernia but concluded that there was no evidence or findings revealing a diaphragmatic hernia during physical exam. The examiner also noted that an abdominal CT scan was negative for a diaphragmatic hernia. 

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in March 2023. The VA examiner found that there was no evidence that supports a finding for a diaphragmatic hernia. The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran had surgery for his left inguinal hernia and there were no hernias detected.

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in November 2023. The VA examiner noted a diagnosis of inguinal and ventral hernia. The Veteran reported continuing to have severe epigastric and umbilical abdominal pain where he often feels that he is going to pass out. He has a large recurrent hernia that appears to be operable and remediable readily reducible however not supported by a truss or a belt. The examiner remarked that as to "the claimant's claimed condition of diaphragmatic hernia, to include as secondary to service-connected residuals of operated left inguinal hernia please refer to the diagnosis section." The diagnosis section of the examination noted that the Veteran had been diagnosed with inguinal hernia in 1967 and ventral hernia in 2012 but did not identify any other hernias.  

Here, the evidence shows that the Veteran's left posteromedial diaphragmatic defect and subsequent fat herniation associated with hernia, inguinal, left, operated residuals, has not resulted in any compensable symptoms. The Veteran has been diagnosed with a number of other hernias that are distinct from his diaphragmatic defect, including inguinal and umbilical hernia. Although the above VA examinations show that the Veteran has reported symptoms including pain with lifting and carrying objects, as well as pyrosis, gastric reflux, and dysphagia, these symptoms have been attributed to his umbilical and inguinal hernias. Moreover, the examiners were unable to identify a diaphragmatic hernia during the review period. Although the November 2023 examiner determined in an associated opinion that there was a diaphragmatic defect, the examiner did not attribute any symptomatology to it. To the extent the Veteran has attributed specific symptoms to the diaphragmatic defect, given the existence of multiple hernias and other issues impacting his internal organs, the Board finds that this issue is medically complex, and he is not competent to attribute particular symptoms to this specific service-connected disability, as doing so would require a thorough understanding of medicine and the mechanics and relationships among various organs.

The Board additionally observes that the Veteran is currently in receipt of 10 and 30 percent ratings under Diagnostic Code 7338 for inguinal hernia, as well as a noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7339 for ventral hernia. Accordingly, the Board finds that an initial compensable rating is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.
