ORDER

Readjudication of the claim for entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A September 2014 rating decision declined to reopen a previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability.

2. New evidence submitted since September 2014, consisting of medical information, does not tend to prove or disprove a matter at issue for the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d), 3.2501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran honorably served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1982 to May 1985. See DD Form 214. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on an appeal from a May 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which declined to readjudicate the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability. In July 2023, the Veteran appealed the denial and selected the direct review docket on his Notice of Disagreement (NOD). See July 2023 VA Form 10182. 

Applicable Evidentiary Window

As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 20.301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on an NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Veteran has not filed such a request.  If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. The appellant is welcome to file a supplemental claim to have this evidence considered. Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023). 

The petition to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability is denied.

The Veteran seeks readjudication of a claim of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability, most recently denied in September 2014, at which time the AOJ denied reopening of the previously denied claim. See April 2023 Statement in Support of Claim. 

VA will readjudicate a previously denied claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(1). In determining whether new and relevant evidence is presented or secured, VA will consider any VA treatment records reasonably identified by the claimant and any evidence received by VA after VA issued notice of a decision on the claim and while the evidentiary record was closed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Notably, before submitting his April 2023 supplemental claim, in January 2023, the Veteran submitted a fully developed claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) requesting readjudication of the issue of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability, along with a copy of VA treatment record from May 2006, and a copy of a treatment note from a private neurologist. See January 2023 Private Treatment records. The AOJ rejected the form and requested the Veteran to resubmit the claim on the proper form, i.e., the supplemental claim. However, the Board will analyze the evidence submitted in January 2023 for the purpose of determining whether readjudication of the claim is warranted. 

In September 2014, the Veteran attempted to reopen the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability, but this claim was denied due to lack of new and material evidence.  In his attempt to reopen this claim in the present case, the Veteran submitted a copy of a VA treatment record dated May 2006.  Unfortunately, the Board finds that such evidence is not new evidence as it was previously part of the record before the AOJ at the time of the September 2014 rating decision that denied reopening of the present claim. 

The Veteran also submitted a treatment note from a private neurologist submitted in January 2023. While this is considered new evidence, it is not relevant evidence that tends to prove a matter at issue regarding the claimed cervical spine disability. Specifically, the January 2023 private treatment record supports the Veteran's current cervical spine diagnosis. However, it does not tend to prove that the disability is related to the Veteran's service, or to his service-connected left shoulder disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(1). 

Similarly, the VA treatment records added to the record since the September 2014 rating decision do not tend to prove that the disability is related to the Veteran's service, or to his service-connected left shoulder disability. See March 2023, April 2023, and May 2023 VA Treatment Records. 

In sum, the evidence received does not tend to prove or disprove the matters at issue for this claim, and as such, readjudication of the issue of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability is not warranted.
