REMANDED

The issue of entitlement to benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1805 for a child born with spina bifida is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1815 for a child born with other covered birth defects is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the U.S. Air Force from July 1965 to September 1969. He served in the Republic of Vietnam. The Veteran died in May 2019. The appellant is the Veteran's child.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In a August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected Direct Review.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. The issue of entitlement to benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1805 for a child born with spina bifida is remanded.

2. The issue of entitlement to benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1815 for a child born with other covered birth defects is remanded.

On his February 2024 application for benefits, the appellant listed several private medical providers who have treated him. VA committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error in that it failed to attempt to obtain these records. Additionally, his claim indicates that he attempted to enroll in the military in 1993. Those records have also not been obtained. Therefore, remand is necessary to attempt to obtain the records. See Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the file any service treatment records (STRs) or service personnel records (SPRs) pertaining to the appellant.

2. Send the appellant a letter asking that he provide authorization to attempt to obtain private treatment records from the providers listed on his February 2024 claim for benefits, to include Boone Health Primary Care in Boonville, Missouri; Big Tree Medical Home; and MU Health Clinic in Boonville, Missouri. If authorization is provided, attempt to obtain the records.
