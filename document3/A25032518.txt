DOCKET NO. 240805-460677
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has a history of systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more; however, his diastolic blood pressure has never been predominantly 100 or more and systolic blood pressure has never been predominantly 200 or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 10 percent rating, but no higher, for hypertension have been met for the entire appeal period. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1970 to December 1974.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), also known as the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate DCs identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4. Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

When considering the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection is required. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 199, 125-26 (1999). Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran's hypertension has been rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101. A 10 percent disability rating is warranted where diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure is predominately 160 or more, or minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted where diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more. A 40 percent disability rating is assigned where diastolic pressure is predominantly 120 or more. A maximum 60 percent disability rating is appropriate where diastolic pressure is predominantly 130 or more.

Under DC 7101, "a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control" refers to blood pressure readings taken before a veteran began medication to control hypertension, and therefore requires analyzing blood pressure readings prior to the period on appeal. See Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021).

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common." See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

In rating hypertension under DC 7101, the Board may consider blood pressure readings taken while a veteran is using medication. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (holding that DC 7101 contemplates the effects of medication and, therefore, Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012) does not apply).

Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for hypertension is granted.

The Veteran's representative contends that the Veteran meets the criteria for a higher rating as his last Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam showed a systolic blood pressure predominately 160 or more. See August 2024 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. 

Initially the Board notes that the evidence of record shows that the Veteran has been on continuous medication to control his blood pressure since approximately November 2019. During that time, the Veteran's blood pressure readings were as follows: 137/90; 196/96; 160/91; 170/99; 172/102; and 183/102. See July 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2023. At that time, the examiner noted the Veteran's blood pressure over a period of 3 days with his blood pressure being measured 3 times per day. The Veteran's blood pressure readings were as follows: Day 1 - 126/60; 149/75; and 145/80. Day 2 - 149/81; 117/73; and 148/82. Day 3 - 162/92; 172/86; and 168/79. Additionally, the examiner noted that on the day of the exam, the Veteran's blood pressure readings were as follows: 196/94; 162/92; and 154/90. 

In total, the systolic pressure was 160 or more in 10 of the Veteran's 18 blood pressure readings. None of those readings, however, showed diastolic pressure of 100 or more or systolic pressure of 200 or more.

Thus, the evidence of record supports that the Veteran's systolic blood pressure readings were predominantly 160 or more. However, for the period on review, the evidence does not support that the Veteran's diastolic blood pressure readings were predominantly 110 or more and his systolic blood pressure has never been predominantly 200 or more, warranting an evaluation higher than 10 percent.

Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes the assignment of a 10 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's hypertension. To that extent the appeal for a compensable rating for hypertension is granted.
