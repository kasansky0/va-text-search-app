FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to March 22, 2023, the Veteran's lumbosacral strain was not manifested by forward flexion greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; nor was the combined range of motion  greater than 120 degrees; or reports/findings of muscle spasm or guarding; nor has there been objective evidence of IVDS or neurologic abnormalities other than the service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy.

2. Effective from March 22, 2023, the Veteran's lumbosacral strain has not been manifested by ankylosis, or the functional equivalent of ankylosis, nor has there been objective evidence of IVDS or neurologic abnormalities other than the service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy.

3. Prior to March 22, 2023, the Veteran's right arm carpal tunnel syndrome was manifested by no more than mild incomplete paralysis.

4. Effective from March 22, 2023, the Veteran's right arm carpal tunnel syndrome is manifested by no more than moderate incomplete paralysis.

5. Prior to March 22, 2023, the Veteran's left arm carpal tunnel syndrome was manifested by no more than mild incomplete paralysis.

6. Effective from March 22, 2023, the Veteran's left arm carpal tunnel syndrome is manifested by no more than moderate incomplete paralysis.

7. Prior to March 22, 2023, the Veteran's migraines were equivalent in nature, frequency, and severity to characteristic prostrating attacks occurring once a month over the last several months, but not very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  

8. Effective from March 22, 2023, the Veteran's migraines manifested in very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

9. The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ for service connection for "low back pain" during his period of active service that was considered to have been received on October 28, 2022, and which also reasonably raised claims for secondary radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities.

10. Entitlement to service connection for sciatic radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities arose on April 28, 2023, the date of the DBQ at which it was first diagnosed.

11. The date entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy arose is later than the date the claim for service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was received.

12. Prior to March 22, 2023, the Veteran did not have a permanent and total service-connected disability, or a TDIU, and she was not otherwise eligible for DEA benefits.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from July 2018 to October 2022.

In the October 2023 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted a 40 percent rating for lumbosacral strain, effective from March 22, 2023, but denied a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to March 22, 2023; granted a 30 percent rating for right arm carpal tunnel syndrome effective from March 22, 2023, but denied a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to March 22, 2023; granted a 20 percent rating for left arm carpal tunnel syndrome effective from March 22, 2023, but denied a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to March 22, 2023; granted a 30 percent rating for migraines effective from March 22, 2023, but denied a compensable rating prior to March 22, 2023; granted service connection for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy, effective March 22, 2023; and established basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status effective from March 22, 2023.  In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38C.F.R. § 20.301.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by application of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and there must be emphasis upon the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to March 22, 2023, and in excess of 40 percent from March 22, 2023, for lumbosacral strain.

The Veteran seeks higher ratings for his service-connected lumbosacral strain, which has been rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5237, the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.

Under the General Rating Formula, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

The Board notes that the rating criteria for the spine were amended on February 7, 2021; DC 5237, however, was not changed.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

The Court has held that a veteran may be entitled to a rating under the General Rating Formula if he experiences the functional equivalent of ankylosis when considering the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 23-24 (2021).

The Board concludes that the criteria for a higher rating prior to and effective from March 22, 2023, have not been met or approximated.  

Review of the record shows that at the October 2021 DBQ (Disability Benefits Questionnaire) conducted while the Veteran was in service, she described her current symptoms as not being able to sit, stand, or walk for a long time.  She reported severe back flare-ups, every 1 to 2 days, and lasting 3 to 4 hours, precipitated by walking, sitting upright, and standing for a period of time, and alleviated by laying down.  She had normal active and passive range of motion, including forward flexion to 90 degrees and extension to 30 degrees, with pain on right and left lateral flexion and with weight bearing.  She was able to perform repetitive use testing with no additional loss of function or range of motion.  The examiner opined that pain, weakness, and lack of endurance significantly limited the Veteran's functional ability with repeated use over time but estimated that there was no additional loss of range of motion.  The examiner opined that pain, fatigability, and weakness, significantly limited the Veteran's functional ability on flare-ups, but estimated that there was no additional loss of range of motion.  The examiner noted that disturbance of locomotion contributed to the Veteran's disability.  The examiner also opined that her back condition impacted her ability to perform any type of occupational task, noting that it affects occupations that require frequent lifting and bending.

VA treatment records showed that in November and December 2022, the Veteran reported chronic back pain, which increased at times, but she had not received any treatment for it.

Review of the record therefore shows that prior to March 22, 2023, the competent evidence of record, including the October 2021 VA examination report and VA treatment records, does not contain range of motion readings that would warrant a rating in excess of 10 percent, nor was there any report or finding of muscle spasms or guarding.  Further, as the Veteran's lumbosacral pain and additional functional limitations were considered in the assignment of the current 10 percent rating, in the absence of compensable limitation of motion, her lumbosacral strain can only be assigned a 10 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  Although at the 2021 examination, she reported severe flare-ups of back pain precipitated by walking, sitting, or standing for a period of time, she was able to perform repetitive-use testing without loss of function or range of motion, and the examiner opined that her functional ability was not significantly limited with repeated use over a period of time or with flare-ups.  Thus, there is insufficient objective evidence to conclude that the Veteran's reported symptoms were associated with such additional functional limitation as to warrant a rating in excess of 10 percent pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, or the holding in DeLuca v. Brown. supra.

With regard to whether a rating in excess of 40 percent is warranted, effective from March 22, 2023, the Board notes that at the April 2023 DBQ completed by Dr. Dhoopati, the Veteran reported increased pain with limitation of motion and that during frequent flare-ups, she was unable to perform some routine daily activities, and movements of any kind were difficult.  She reported severe pain and tightness, which caused significant limitation of motion.  She also reported that she could not stand, sit, or walk for extended periods, and that bending over was very difficult and caused pain, which limited her ability to sleep, clean, and drive.  

Active and passive range of motion testing revealed forward flexion was limited to 60 degrees and all other ranges of motion were limited to 20 degrees, with pain on all ranges of motion.  She had pain during weightbearing and non-weightbearing activities.  She was able to perform repetitive use testing with no additional loss of function or range of motion.  There was moderate pain and tenderness on palpation of the paravertebral muscles.  The examiner opined that pain, fatigability, weakness, and lack of endurance significantly limited her functional ability with repeated use over time and estimated that flexion would be further limited to 45 degrees and all other ranges of motion would be limited to 15 degrees.  The examiner further opined that pain, fatigability, weakness, and lack of endurance significantly limited functional ability during flare-ups and estimated that flexion would be further limited to 35 degrees and all other ranges of motion would be limited to 10 degrees.  The Veteran had guarding and muscles spasms which resulted in abnormal gait.  She occasionally used a lumbar brace for pain and support during flare-ups.  The examiner opined that her back condition impacted her ability to perform any type of occupational task, noting that she was limited in bending and turning at the waist as well as carrying or lifting heavy objects, was unable to remain seated for extended periods of time as this caused increased tightness, and had to take frequent breaks to stretch and move around, affecting work productivity and performance.

In considering whether a rating in excess of 40 percent is warranted, the Board finds that the record shows that the Veteran's forward flexion range of motion was limited to, at worse, 30 degrees during flare-ups, along with severe and increased pain, which is contemplated by the current 40 percent rating.  However, as the competent evidence does not show, and the Veteran has not asserted otherwise, the presence of ankylosis of the lumbar spine, a rating of 50 percent is not warranted, even with consideration of the functional impairment resulting from pain and other such factors.  In addition, the Board finds that the lay evidence does not show that her lumbar spine disability is productive of the functional equivalent of ankylosis, namely, lack of any movement of the lumbar spine.  Even considering the significant functional limitations during flare-ups and repeated use over time, ankylosis of the entire lumbar spine is not approximated.  Thus, a rating in excess of 40 percent from March 22, 2023, is not warranted.  

The Board also notes that the record shows no diagnosis of IVDS at any point during the pendency of the claim and therefore higher ratings are not warranted under DC 5243.  Further, with regard to considering whether any associated objective neurologic abnormalities should be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code, the Board notes that the Veteran is already in receipt of separate ratings for right and left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy. 

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent prior to March 22, 2023, and a rating in excess of 40 percent from March 22, 2023, for the service-connected lumbosacral spine disability.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to March 22, 2023, and in excess of 30 percent from March 22, 2023, for right arm carpal tunnel syndrome.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to March 22, 2023, and in excess of 20 percent from March 22, 2023, for left arm carpal tunnel syndrome.

The Veteran seeks higher ratings for the service-connected right arm carpal tunnel syndrome and left arm carpal tunnel syndrome, which have been rated under DC 8515, for paralysis of the median nerve.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  Neuritis of the median nerve is rated under DC 8615, and neuralgia of the median nerve is rated under DC 8715.  Id. 

Under DC 8515, mild incomplete paralysis of the median nerve of either extremity warrants a 10 percent disability rating.  Moderate incomplete paralysis of the median nerve warrants a 20 percent (minor) or 30 percent (major) evaluation.  Severe incomplete paralysis of the median nerve warrants a 40 percent (minor) or 50 percent (major) evaluation.  Complete paralysis of the median nerve warrants a 60 percent (minor) or 70 percent (major) evaluation with the hand inclined to the ulnar side with the index and middle fingers more extended than normally, considerable atrophy of the muscles of the thenar eminence, and the thumb in the plane of the hand (ape hand); incomplete and defective pronation of the hand with the absence of flexion of the index finger, feeble flexion of the middle finger, inability to make a fist, and index and middle fingers that remain extended; inability to flex the distal phalanx of the thumb with defective opposition and abduction of the thumb at right angles to the palm; weakened flexion of the wrist; and pain with trophic disturbances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  Id.

The words "mild" "moderate" and "severe" as used in the various diagnostic codes are not defined in the VA Schedule.  Ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Thus, the Board turns to dictionary definitions for assistance.  See Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 80506 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  The term "mild" is defined as "gentle in nature or behavior" or "not being or involving what is extreme."  "Moderate," as an adjective, is defined as "not violent, severe, or intense" or "limited in scope or effect."  "Severe" means "causing a lot of physical pain or suffering" or "of a great degree."  See Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary (last visited August 8, 2024).  

Prior to March 22, 2023, at the October 2021 Peripheral Nerve Conditions DBQ, the Veteran reported pain in the wrists and numbing and locking of her fingers.  The symptoms attributed to her bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome included mild intermittent pain, mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and mild numbness.  Muscle strength testing and reflex examination were normal in the upper extremities.  Sensory examination revealed normal sensation of the upper extremities.  No trophic changes were noted.  The examiner identified the affected nerve and severity as mild incomplete paralysis of the bilateral median nerves.  The Veteran regularly used wrist braces, and the condition was noted to impact her ability to work jobs that require frequent typing and writing.  

Based on the above, during the period prior to March 22, 2023, the Board finds that the Veteran's right arm carpal tunnel syndrome and left arm carpal tunnel syndrome disabilities were primarily manifested by mild intermittent pain, mild paresthesia/dysesthesias, and mild numbness of right and left upper extremities.  The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against a finding that the disabilities are manifested by any significant impairment of motor functions, as well as any sensory disturbances, trophic changes, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis.  Additionally, reflex testing was normal.  Finally, while not dispositive, the 2021 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right arm and left arm carpal tunnel syndrome resulted in mild incomplete paralysis of the median nerve group.  In light of the foregoing, the Board concludes that for the period prior to March 22, 2023, the level of impairment was most analogous to mild incomplete paralysis of the affected nerves and assignment of ratings in excess of 10 percent based on moderate incomplete paralysis is not warranted for either the right arm carpal tunnel syndrome or left arm carpal tunnel syndrome. 

In considering whether higher ratings are warranted effective from March 22, 2023, for the Veteran's right and left arm carpal tunnel disabilities, the Board notes that at the April 2023 DBQ, the Veteran complained of worsening symptoms of pain and numbness.  The examiner indicated that right arm and left arm carpal tunnel syndrome impacted her ability to work, noting that it affected her ability to turn doorknobs, open cans, write, and type.  

Regarding impairment of motor functions, the April 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran had reduced (4/5) muscle strength for the right and left grip and right and left pinch from thumb to index finger. 

Regarding trophic changes, the April 2023 VA examiner indicated that there were no trophic changes (characterized by loss of extremity hair, smooth, shiny skin, etc.) attributable to peripheral neuropathy.

Regarding sensory disturbance, at the April 2023 DBQ, sensation testing for light touch was decreased in the right and left hand/fingers.  Further, the symptoms attributed to her bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome included moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and moderate numbness.  

Regarding loss of reflexes, at the April 2023 DBQ, the examiner indicated that reflexes of the biceps and triceps were normal and hypoactive in the brachioradialis.  

Regarding pain, the April 2023 DBQ examiner indicated there was moderate intermittent pain in the right and left arms. 

Regarding muscle atrophy, there was no muscle atrophy noted in the upper arms at the April 2023 DBQ.

Regarding complete paralysis, the April 2023 DBQ indicated that there was moderate incomplete paralysis of the right median nerve and left median nerve.

Based on the above, the Board finds that effective from March 22, 2023, the Veteran's right arm carpal tunnel syndrome and left arm carpal tunnel syndrome more nearly approximated moderate incomplete paralysis.  Although reduced muscle strength was noted and reflexes were slightly impaired, the right and left arm carpal tunnel conditions continued to have primarily manifest sensory disturbances including symptoms of moderate intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness.  Additionally, the most probative evidence is against a finding that the disability is manifest by impairment of motor functions, trophic changes, loss of reflexes, or muscle atrophy.  The Board therefore finds that the level of impairment throughout the appeal period is most analogous to moderate incomplete paralysis.  Finally, while not dispositive, the 2023 DBQ examiner opined that her right and left carpal tunnel disabilities resulted in moderate incomplete paralysis of the median nerves.  In light of the foregoing, for the period from March 22, 2023, the level of impairment was most analogous to moderate incomplete paralysis of the affected nerves and, therefore, effective from March 22, 2023, the assignment of a rating in excess of 30 percent for right arm carpal tunnel syndrome is not warranted and the assignment of a rating in excess of 20 percent for left arm carpal tunnel syndrome is not warranted.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable DCs, but there is no evidence showing that the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other upper extremity peripheral nerves that have not already been service connected.  Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different DC is not warranted at any point during the appeal period.

4. Entitlement to a compensable rating prior to March 22, 2023, and a rating in excess of 30 percent from March 22, 2023, for migraines.

The Veteran seeks higher ratings for her service-connected migraine headaches which have been rated pursuant to DC 8100.

DC 8100 provides for a noncompensable rating for migraines with less frequent attacks.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months.  A maximum 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.124a.

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018).  This renders 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable.  Id.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation.  Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The criteria for a 50 percent rating contain several undefined phrases, including "very frequent," which connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, supra.  The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraines attack must render the veteran entirely powerless.  The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract."  Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability."  Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445-46 (2004).

The Board concludes that prior to March 22, 2023, the competent evidence of record shows that the nature, frequency, and severity of the Veteran's migraines have more nearly approximated the criteria for a 30 percent rating under DC 8100.  

In that regard, at the October 2021 VA examination, the Veteran described current symptoms as ringing in the ears, headaches, and sensitivity to light, smell, and noise; and she reported that her condition impacted her ability to perform occupational functioning and ordinary activities in that she needed to sit in a dark room on bad days.  She took over-the-counter pain medications and described her headache pain as localized to one side and lasting less than a day.  She described associated non-headache symptoms as nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have characteristic prostrating attacks of headache pain or very prostrating and prolonged attacks of pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The examiner also indicated that her headache condition did not impact her ability to work.  

A November 2022 VA treatment record noted that the Veteran complained of headaches, averaging more than 1 time a month and lasting hours to days.  She described the headache pain as throbbing and pulsating and accompanied by nausea and photophobia.  It was also noted that headaches aroused her from sleep.  She reported feeling irritable prior to headaches and that she would lay down in a dark room.  She used a cold compress on the neck and reported that headaches were improved with pressure.  The assessment was headaches, possible migraines.

The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report readily observable symptoms.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

Considering the lay and medical relevant evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's lay report of having headaches averaging more than 1 time a month, lasting hours to days, and requiring her to sit or lay down in a dark room, more nearly approximates characteristic prostrating attacks averaging once a month and corresponding to the criteria for a 30 percent rating under DC 8100.  The Board also finds that prior to March 22, 2023, a higher 50 percent rating under DC 8100 is not warranted as the competent evidence does not show that the Veteran's migraines were productive of severe economic inadaptability.  In that regard, the Board notes that while she reported that her headaches impacted her ability to work, the VA examiner concluded otherwise, and the Veteran also indicated that headaches were improved with pressure.  Moreover, the nature, severity, and frequency of the Veteran's headaches did not approximate very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks as listed in the criteria for a higher 50 percent rating under DC 8100.

The Board also concludes that effective from March 22, 2023, the competent evidence of record shows that the Veteran's migraines occurred with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability, corresponding to higher 50 percent rating under DC 8100.  

In that regard, a March 2023 VA treatment record showed that the Veteran reported persistent headaches over the past 3 years that started in the morning after she woke up and started moving, continued all day, and stayed with her most of the time, but were not related to any particular position or activity.  The examiner suggested that the Veteran receive a consultation in the neurology headache clinic to specifically address her problem, have it treated and diagnosed properly, since it is "bothering [her] significantly" and "has been going on for the past few years."

Further, at the April 2023 VA examination, the Veteran described worsening headache pain often accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.  She reported the pain was usually moderately to severely intense and can last more than 2 days.  She also reported that her migraines were becoming progressively worse and were affecting her financial status.  She described her headache pain as pulsating or throbbing, on both sides of the head, and worsened with physical activity.  She described non-headache symptoms including nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sounds, changes in vision, and sensory changes.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of pain once every month, and also that she had very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's migraines impacted her ability to work in that they created unbearable pain, can be incapacitating, caused symptoms that distracted from her work and affected work productivity and performance.  It was also noted that she has had to call off work or leave early due to headache pain and has to find a dark, quiet place when flare-ups occur.  The examiner also indicated that the Veteran's migraines caused considerate impairment to her health.  Finally, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's condition had worsened and was "not fully relieved due to the nature of headaches," and that she tried to deal with the symptoms as much as possible, but the medication had not provided relief for symptoms.  The examiner opined that due to the history of the headaches, as they continue to worsen, they will not subside in the future.

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board concludes that effective from March 22, 2023, the nature, frequency, and severity of her migraine headaches have approximated the criteria for a 50 percent rating under DC 8100.  In that regard, the 2023 DBQ examiner found that the Veteran did suffer from "very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability" and review of the competent medical evidence and lay statements shows that the Veteran experienced worsening migraines that affected her productivity and performance and which caused her to have to call off work or leave early.  The examiner also indicated that the Veteran's headaches caused considerate impairment to her health and were "not fully relieved due to the nature of headaches" and that medication did not relieve her symptoms.  While the Veteran's headaches did not prevent her from working, her headaches clearly impacted her ability to work and were productive of severe economic inadaptability.  This is particularly true considering the additional non-headache symptoms she reported including nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, changes in vision, and sensory changes.  As the maximum schedular rating for headaches under DC 8100 is 50 percent, effective from March 22, 2023, a higher schedular rating is not available.  No other diagnostic code is applicable, and the Board cannot identify a diagnostic code which would afford a rating higher than 50 percent disabling for the Veteran's migraine headaches.  

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 22, 2023, for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy.

6. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 22, 2023, for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy.

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than March 22, 2023, for the grants of service connection right and left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy, claiming that an earlier effective date is warranted essentially asserting that the claim was "still within 1 year of discharge from Navy."  See October 2023 VA Form 10182. 

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection shall be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

During her active service, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ for service connection for "low back pain" that was considered to have been received on October 28, 2022, the day after her discharge from active duty.  At that time, the Veteran did not claim entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy.  

In the November 2022 rating decision, service connection was established for lumbosacral strain effective from October 28, 2022.  

In a March 22, 2023, letter, VA advised the Veteran that they had received her intent to file a claim for compensation.

Thereafter, in June 2023, the Veteran filed a claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) for bilateral lower radiculopathy which she stated she "developed ... secondary [to her] lumbosacral spine" and that she now feels "numbness, tingling, and weakness down my legs and feet."  

Along with the June 2023 claim, the Veteran submitted an April 2023 Peripheral Nerves DBQ which noted a diagnosis of bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  It was noted that she had a "long history of bilateral radiculopathy after sustaining back injuries during active duty," and was currently service connected for this condition and complained of worsening pain, numbness, and loss of feeling in the legs and feet.  She also submitted an April 2023 Back Conditions DBQ at which she reported that her symptoms have progressed to now include lower extremity numbness and pain.  Straight leg raising test revealed positive results and the examiner indicated that she showed mild to moderate sensory and subjective symptoms of radiculopathy as a result of progression of her spinal condition.  

In the October 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted for sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity and left lower extremity, as related to the service-connected disability of lumbosacral strain, effective March 22, 2023, the date that the intent to file a claim was received.

As noted above, the Veteran essentially seeks an effective date of October 28, 2022, for the grants of service connection for sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity and left lower extremity.  Review of the record prior to March 22, 2023, shows no indication in the record that the Veteran filed a claim or intent to file a claim for service connection for sciatic radiculopathy of the lower extremities.  Generally, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151.

Although service connection was granted for sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity and left lower extremity as neurological complications related to the service-connected disability of lumbosacral strain, the Board finds that this does not provide a basis for granting an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for sciatic radiculopathy of the lower extremities.  

The Board acknowledges that pursuant to VA regulation, once VA receives a complete claim, VA will adjudicate as part of the claim entitlement to any ancillary benefits that arise as a result of the adjudication decision.  The Veteran need not assert entitlement to ancillary benefits at the time the complete claim is filed.  VA will also consider all lay and medical evidence of record in order to adjudicate entitlement to benefits for the claimed condition as well as entitlement to any additional benefits for complications of the claimed condition.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2).  The language of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2) has been interpreted to require VA to develop and adjudicate related claims for secondary service connection for disabilities that are "reasonably raised" during the adjudication of a formally initiated claim for the "proper evaluation level for the primary service-connected disability."  See Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021).

Unlike in Bailey, however, claims for sciatic radiculopathy of the lower extremities were not reasonably raised during the adjudication of an increased rating claim for the lumbosacral spine nor was there any competent evidence indicating that the Veteran had radiculopathy of the lower extremities as a complication of her lumbar spine disability.  Rather, at the time she filed the service connection claim for a low back disability, there was no indication of radiculopathy or signs or symptoms of radiculopathy in the record.  The April 2023 DBQs were the first indication of bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and at that time, she reported her symptoms had now progressed to include lower extremity numbness and pain.    

As noted above, the effective date of the award will be the date of receipt of the claim (March 22, 2023), or the date entitlement arose (April 28, 2023), whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400.  Here, the AOJ has assigned an effective date of March 22, 2023, using the date of the intent to file a claim for the grant of service connection for sciatic radiculopathy of the lower extremities despite entitlement not arising until April 28, 2023 (date of the DBQs that first diagnosed these disabilities).  The Board will not disturb the AOJ's finding in this regard, but concludes that an effective date earlier than March 22, 2023, for service connection for sciatic radiculopathy of the lower extremities is not warranted.

7. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 22, 2023, for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits.  In an October 2023 rating decision, the Veteran's combined evaluation for compensation was found to be 100 percent, effective from March 22, 2023.  The AOJ also granted the Veteran basic eligibility to Dependents' Education Assistance benefits, effective from March 22, 2023, based on evidence demonstrating she now had a totally disabling service-connected disability or disabilities, permanent in nature.  As eligibility for Dependents' Education Assistance benefits is predicated on a finding of permanent and total disability in this case and permanent and total disability has been found from March 22, 2023, an earlier effective date is not warranted for entitlement to basic eligibility for Dependents' Education Assistance benefits.
