REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1989 to December 1993.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2023 and constitutes an initial decision, which denied the issue of an earlier effective date for the award of DEA benefits; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2022 decision.  In March 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2022 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date than January 31, 2020, for the grant of eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA).  

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date than January 31, 2020, for an award of DEA.  

In claims for increased disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred if the claim is received by the VA within one year after that date.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  

For purposes of eligibility to DEA benefits under Chapter 35, the child or surviving spouse of a veteran will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service- connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a).  DEA benefits may not be awarded prior to the effective date of a permanent and total service-connected disability rating.  

As the only method of eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits which is relevant to the Veteran in this case is through having a permanent total service-connected disability, the effective date for DEA benefits is directly predicated on the effective date from which VA considered that the Veteran's permanent and total disability commenced for purposes of VA benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021(a)(iii), (p), (r).  VA has awarded a TDIU from January 31, 2020, which the Board has found herein to be the earliest effective date for entitlement to a TDIU.

Given the VA decision to grant entitlement to a TDIU from January 31, 2020, entitlement to DEA arose on January 31, 2020.  Therefore, an effective date prior to January 31, 2020, for the award of DEA is not warranted.

17. Entitlement to total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU).  

In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 to express disagreement with a November 2020 rating decision that denied an increased rating for service-connected myositis and service connection for adrenal insufficiency and chronic kidney disease and selected the hearing lane under the AMA.  

In May 2021, the Veteran selected the direct review lane for the appeal of service connection for chronic kidney disease, adrenal insufficiency, degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, Peyronie's Disease, and erectile dysfunction.  See May 2020 VA Form 10182.  The appeal also included the issues of increased rating for right knee strain, patellofemoral pain syndrome of the left knee with degenerative arthritis, myositis, peristent depressive disorder, earlier effective date for right knee strain, and entitlement to TDIU.  

Subsequently, after the submission of the November 2020 and May 2021 VA Form 10182s, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application addressing the issues in the November 2020 and May 2021 VA Form 10182 in November 2021.  

The Veteran was sent a letter in November 2021 informing the Veteran and his representative that pending appeals for myositis, Peyronie's Disease, chronic kidney disease, erectile dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, persistent depressive disorder, and TDIU received in November 2020 and May 2021 are being processed.  

In April 2022, a supplemental claim rating decision addressed the issues subject to the November 2021 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application.  The rating decision awarded service connection for left knee and right knee instability, and granted an evaluation of 30 percent, and awarded DEA benefits, effective November 4, 2021.  Moreover, the rating decision denied appeals related to patellofemoral pain syndrome of the left knee with degenerative arthritis, peristent depressive disorder, lumbar spine, erectile dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, chronic kidney disease, Peyronie's Disease, dermatitis with chronic urticaria, right knee strain, TDIU, and myositis.  

In April 2022, the Veteran and his representative filed a VA Form 10182 selecting the direct review lane as it related to the issues of increased rating for dermatitis with chronic urticaria, persistent depressive disorder, and earlier effective date for dermatitis.  

The Veteran and his representative once again submitted a request for higher level review on February 27, 2023, related to the issues of lumbar spine, adrenal insufficiency, chronic kidney disease, erectile dysfunction, Peyronie's Disease, right and left knee, myositis, depressive disorder, dermatitis, DEA benefits, and TDIU.  

A March 2023 rating decision denied earlier effective date for DEA benefits based on the request for higher level review on February 27, 2023.  The Veteran, however, was informed that the February 2023 higher level review request for the issues of lumbar spine, adrenal insufficiency, chronic kidney disease, erectile dysfunction, Peyronie's Disease, right and left knee, myositis, depressive disorder, dermatitis, and TDIU were rejected as the Veteran has previously selected a Board review of those issues in November 2020 and May 2021 without a intention to withdraw those issues from the Board.  

The Veteran and his representative disagree with the rejection of the higher-level review in the March VA 2023 letter in the March 2024 VA Form 10182.  

Under the AMA, a claimant may take any of the following actions within one year from the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision on a claim: file a request for Higher-Level Review, file a Supplemental Claim, or file a Notice of Disagreement (Board appeal), provided that a claimant is not pursuing these requests concurrently.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a).  Once a claimant takes any of the above actions, the claimant may not take another action with respect to the same claim or same issue contained within the claim until the Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement is adjudicated or withdrawn.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

In Terry v. McDonough, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited.  37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).  The Court held that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option."  Id. at 26.  The Court's holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple administrative review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A).  Id. at 2.  Accordingly, the Court's holding in Terry shows that only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues.  

In summary, as these issues are already pending on appeal from previous VA Form 10182s (November 2020, May 2021, and April 2022) filed, the Board finds the attempted February 2023 appeal to be a concurrent election.  

The Board acknowledges the April 2022 rating decision adjudicated the claims based on the November 2021 supplement claim, however, the Veteran already submitted these issues to the Board in the November 2020 and May 2021 VA Form 10182s.  Moreover, review of record indicates that the April 2022 rating decision was produced in error, as the Veteran and his accredited attorney were informed in November 2021 that appeals related to his Board review selections in November 2020 and May 2021 were already pending, and the issues that were not already on appeal would be processed.  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), concurrent elections are prohibited.  Thus, the Board concludes that a dismissal is warranted due to a non-jurisdiction procedural defect.
