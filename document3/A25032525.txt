ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of August 21, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On August 21, 2020, VA received the Veteran's initial claim for service connection for PTSD, and the Veteran continuously pursued an appeal of such.

2. Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for PTSD were met at the time of his initial service connection claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of August 21, 2020, for the award of service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2005 to March 2006 and from October 2006 to January 2016.  The Veteran's service from October 24, 2010, to January 15, 2016, is currently characterized as under dishonorable conditions. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes the one-year period, commencing on the date of the issuance of the rating decision on appeal, in which to switch docket lanes has not yet ended.  However, the Board finds the representative's appellate brief indicates that the Veteran would like for appellate review to proceed as soon as possible.  Moreover, as the Board grants the specific benefit sought herein, the Board finds there is no prejudice proceeding with appellate review at this time.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 9, 2023, for the award of service connection for PTSD. 

The Veteran contends the appropriate effective date for service connection for PTSD is August 21, 2020, the date of claim, rather than the currently assigned February 9, 2023.  

According to applicable law and regulation, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based upon an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The date of entitlement to an award of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act, a determination on a claim by the AOJ becomes final unless the claimant continuously pursues the claim by filing a supplemental claim, a request for higher-level review, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1).  If a claimant continuously pursues an issue by filing one of these administrative review options within one year, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  If a supplemental claim is received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issued notice of a decision, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the supplemental claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever was later.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(h)(2).

VA must look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as an application or claim, both formal and informal, for benefits and is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits.  See Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992).  A claim for VA benefits, whether formal or informal, must be in writing and must identify the benefit sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5101; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377 (1999).   Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, was considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  While the VA should broadly interpret submissions from a veteran, it is not required to conjure up claims not specifically raised.  Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32 (1998); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995).

By way of background, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD in an April 2023 rating decision and assigned an effective date of February 9, 2023.  In September 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim through VA Form 20-0995 requesting an earlier effective date for the award.  A January 2024 rating decision denied the assignment of an earlier effective date.  The Veteran filed a higher-level review in February 2024 VA Form 20-0996.  The May 2024 rating decision on appeal followed.  

Turning to the evidence of record, on August 21, 2020, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for PTSD. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for PTSD in December 2021.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD that conformed to the DSM-5 criteria based on that day's evaluation of the Veteran.  The examiner reasoned that although the Veteran was exposed to traumatic events, his symptom clusters were most appropriately diagnosed as major depressive disorder (MDD), and not associated with the exposure to a general hostile military environment in Iraq.  The examiner also noted that the Veteran reported the onset of his symptoms over the last 10 years and as secondary to his deployment, court martial, divorce, and loss of children.  He also reported that his symptoms had persisted to this day and that he began his medication a year ago.  The examiner then opined that the Veteran's MDD was less likely than not a result of an in-service stressor related event.  The examiner reasoned that there was no indication of PTSD.  

An April 2022 private treatment record documented a diagnosis of PTSD.  

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination for PTSD in February 2023.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD that conforms to the DSM-5 criteria based on the evaluation.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have more than one mental disorder diagnosed.  The Veteran reported his stressor as witnessing a vehicle in front of him be hit by an improvised explosive device, causing the gunner to be thrown from the vehicle, and the Veteran having to provide security until the vehicle was recovered.  The examiner noted that this stressor met criterion A and that it was related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity. 

In a July 2023 statement from the Veteran's wife, she stated that the Veteran had turned to drinking to manage his symptoms, but that after years of encouragement and insistence, the Veteran reached out to the VA for help and was willing to go to their family doctor.  She further stated that the Veteran's symptoms did not occur just the day that he was diagnosed by a VA physician, and that the Veteran's PTSD was the reason that he finally filed for VA disability benefits.  In a July 2023 statement, the Veteran's mother stated that he had not spoken about his deployment to this day.  

In a July 2023 opinion, the examiner noted that the Veteran's first examination in December 2021 found the Veteran to be experiencing symptoms of major depressive disorder and that several criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD were not met.  The examiner further noted that the Veteran was next examined in February 2023 and was found to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD at that time.  The examiner concluded that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's reported symptoms have worsened, rather than being under-reported in the December 2021 VA examination report.  The examiner further concluded that the Veteran's depression is now better defined as PTSD and that his depression is subsumed within PTSD.  The examiner then concluded that the Veteran did not have symptoms of, or meet the diagnostic criteria for, a diagnosis of PTSD at the time of the December 2021 VA examination.  

As noted above, under the AMA a veteran may continuously pursue a claim by filing a request for higher-level review or a supplemental claim within the one-year appeal period, as this Veteran did. Therefore, the Board finds that, as a procedural matter, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD has been continuously pursued since the filing of his August 21, 2020, VA Form 21-526EZ.

Turning to the issue of whether the evidence of record supports an effective date earlier than the currently assigned date of February 9, 2023, the Board notes that the April 2023 rating decision that granted service connection for PTSD did so based upon the February 2023 VA examination, which formally diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD.  Prior to the February 2023 VA examination, the Veteran had previously attended a VA examination in December 2021, with the examiner therein finding that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.

Although not formally diagnosed with PTSD until the February 9, 2023, VA examination, the Board finds that the Veteran's lay statements, his reports to the VA examiners, and private treatment records are consistent both prior to, and subsequent to, the February 2023 VA examination.  The Board notes that the Veteran's mother stated that her son had never talked about the Iraq war to her and would startle easily.  The Board also notes that the Veteran's wife stated that the Veteran had turned to drink to manage his symptoms.  These statements were not submitted until after the December 2021 VA examination, in which the examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD.  The Board, however, affords the December 2021 VA examination and opinion little probative value because the examiner did not provide an adequate opinion of whether the Veteran's diagnosed major depressive disorder was related to or caused by service.  The examiner instead only reasoned that there was no indication of PTSD.  

The Board similarly does not afford the July 2023 opinion significant probative value with regard to the examiner's conclusions that the Veteran's symptoms had more likely worsened since December 2021 instead of being under-reported, the Veteran's depression was now better defined as PTSD, and the Veteran did not have symptoms of or meet the criteria for PTSD at the time of the December 2021 VA examination.  The Board finds this opinion flawed for two reasons.  First, the conclusion that the Veteran did not underreport his symptoms during the December 2021 VA examination is not supported by any rationale, and such conclusion is inconsistent with the statements by the Veteran's mother and wife.  Second, the July 2023 VA examiner did not address the April 2022 private treatment record which reflects that the Veteran had a diagnosis of PTSD documented a few months after the December 2021 VA examination and prior to his currently assigned effective date of February 9, 2023.   

Therefore, while the Board acknowledges the findings and opinions of the December 2021 and the July 2023 VA examiners, the Board finds that the record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran met the requirements for service connection for PTSD prior to February 9, 2023.  Here, the Board affords some probative value to the private treatment records reflecting a diagnosis of PTSD a few months after the December 2021 VA examination, the July 2023 VA examiner's conclusion that the Veteran's MDD was subsumed by the diagnosis of PTSD, the underlying assertion from the Veteran's wife and mother reflecting that he had a history of underreporting his symptoms and self-medicating, and the February 2023 VA examiner's conclusion, upon which the AOJ granted the claim of service connection for PTSD, that the Veteran had a diagnosis of PTSD and did not have more than one mental disorder diagnosed.  

However, the Board finds there is no document of record that can be construed as a formal or informal claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, that was received prior to the receipt of his claim on August 21, 2020.  Notably, neither the Veteran nor his representative asserts the existence of an earlier claim for service connection.  Accordingly, entitlement to an effective date of August 21, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for PTSD is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.
