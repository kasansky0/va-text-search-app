DATE: April 8, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1967 to June 1975. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR THE REGIONAL OFFICE (RO) ADJUDICATOR:

This is a remand to cure a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 

The Veteran is seeking entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for his service connected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  Based on the period on appeal, the Veteran's GERD is rated under diagnostic code 7346, which does not consider the use of medication for the treatment of GERD.  However, evidence of record shows that the Veteran's GERD requires continuous medication for treatment. If a diagnostic code does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication the Board is required to discount the ameliorative effects of medication when evaluating a disability; the Board is required to specifically acknowledge, discuss and discount the beneficial effects of medication. As such, remand is warranted to obtain more information about the ameliorative effects of the Veteran's medication for GERD. 

Additionally, Appellants are entitled to a hearing at the AOJ before VA issues a decision on an initial or supplemental claim pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103 (d)(1) and 3.103(b)(1). Notice of this right to a hearing must be provided to the Veteran and the representative. This is to correct an error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty.

THE REMAND DIRECTIVES FOLLOW.

2. Obtain an opinion regarding the following from an appropriate examiner.

(a.) Clearly indicate whether any medications (over the counter or prescription) the Veteran used affected the level of severity of his GERD disability as of the December 2023 examination.

(b.) If any such medication was productive of ameliorative affects, clearly identify such effects and opine as to the severity of the GERD disability absent such medication as of the GERD examination. 

3. Provide the Veteran and the representative notice of the right to participate in a pre-decisional RO hearing and allow a reasonable period to respond/request the hearing prior to readjudicating the claim.

4. Readjudicate.
