REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the United States Army from November 1976 to November 1996.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the January 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of OSA, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran was informed that this appeal was untimely. See July 2024 BVA Untimely Appeal Letter. However, that notification was an error.  As background, in December 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182: Notice of Disagreement with the October 2021 rating decision but failed to select a review option.  The Veteran was notified that he had 60 days from the date of the notification letter advising him of the incomplete form or 1 year from the decision letter to submit a completed form.  See December 2021 BVA letter.  In January 2022, the Veteran's representative submitted a completed 10182 which had a date stamp from the St. Petersburg VA Regional Office mailroom of January 24, 2022.  However, the 10182 was not uploaded into the claims file until February 1, 2022 and was mislabeled as "correspondence." On June 21, 2024, a copy of the completed January 24, 2022 10182 was properly labeled as a Notice of Disagreement and uploaded to the claims file, which led to the erroneous notification that the appeal was untimely. Because a completed 10182 clarifying the review option the Veteran sought was received within 1 year of the rating decision on appeal, the appeal is timely, and the Board may proceed with adjudication. 38 C.F.R. 20.202.

1. Entitlement to service connection for OSA.

The Veteran contends that his OSA onset during active military service. 

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). For the reasons set forth below, the Board finds that remand is warranted to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2021. The Board finds that the October 2021 VA medical opinion is inadequate and affords it no probative value.  The examiner stated there was "no objective documentation to support a diagnosis of OSA until May 26, 2021..."  The Board concludes the VA medical opinion is heavily influenced by the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (stating that the Board erred in relying on a medical examiner who "ultimately relies not on the objective medical evidence, but rather the absence of such in reaching her opinion that the onset of the appellant's psychiatric symptoms did not occur during service"; and "the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence may not serve as the sole basis for discrediting a lay report).  Further, private treatment records indicate the Veteran was diagnosed with OSA, severe with hypoxemia in February 2020.  Therefore, the October 2021 opinion is based on an inaccurate factual premise as well.  As such, remand is necessary to obtain an adequate medical opinion. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain an addendum medical opinion as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea. The need for another clinical evaluation is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the addendum opinion.

The examiner MUST review the medical records contained in the claims file and a copy of this remand. The examiner should certify that this review was completed in their response. 

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following: 

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's OSA onset during his military service?

For purposes of this opinion only, presume the Veteran's lay statements are credible. An opinion based on a lack of in-service treatment, complaints, or diagnosis is not adequate without explaining the significance of the lack of treatment.

A complete medical rationale must be provided for all opinion(s) offered. If the requested opinion(s) cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and identify what additional evidence, if any, would allow for a more definitive opinion.

2. Readjudicate the issue on appeal.
