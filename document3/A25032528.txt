ORDER

An effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On October 31, 2022, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) received an Intent to File followed by a March 2023 claim for service connection for hypertension; in a June 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service-connection for hypertension, with a noncompensable disability rating assigned, effective from October 31, 2022. 

2. A January 2024 higher-level review rating decision assigned an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension pursuant to a liberalizing law - the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), 38 U.S.C § 1116.

3. The Veteran filed this [separate] claim for service connection for hypertension (which is the subject of this appeal), less than one year following the enactment of the PACT Act; the Veteran continuously pursued his claim for an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for hypertension from October 31, 2022, the date of his Intent to File; and the date of the Veteran's claim was later than the date entitlement to service connection for hypertension arose.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C §§ 1116, 5107, 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.114, 3.155, 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1964 to July 1967.  

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a January 2024 higher-level review of a June 2023 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  The June 2023 rating decision granted service connection for hypertension and assigned a noncompensable disability rating, effective from October 31, 2022.  The January 2024 higher-level review rating decision assigned an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension and continued the previously assigned noncompensable disability rating for hypertension.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114

In a January 2025 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed the denial of an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension.  The Veteran also waived his ability to request to switch AMA dockets pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024); and he elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Notably, as discussed in more detail below, the Veteran has a pending appeal before the Board under docket number 220408-235004, seeking service connection for a heart disability, to include atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hypertension on a direct basis prior to August 10, 2022, the effective date of the PACT Act.  

That appeal is currently before the Board following a February 2025 Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC or Court) Order granting a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) requesting to vacate that part of the Board's June 2024 decision that denied entitlement to service connection for a heart disability [to include hypertension] prior to the August 10, 2022 effective date of the PACT Act; i.e. on a direct basis.  The JMPR found that the June 2024 Board decision failed to address whether service connection for a heart disorder [to include hypertension] is warranted on a direct basis prior to the enactment of the PACT Act.  That appeal remains docketed under Docket Number 220408-235004, and a Board decision in compliance with the February 2025 JMPR directives will be forthcoming.

Procedural History

By way of background, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for a heart disability, claimed as atrial fibrillation, in May 2017.  The RO denied the claim in a July 2017 rating decision and the Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement in the legacy review system.  The Veteran subsequently requested to opt-in to the new review system via the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) in August 2018.  In the RAMP opt-in the Veteran selected the option for a higher-level review of a July 2017 rating decision that denied service connection for atrial fibrillation (which was subsequently expanded to include all heart disabilities, including hypertension).  In a December 2018 higher-level review RAMP rating decision, the AOJ continued the denial of service connection for atrial fibrillation, and in March 2019, the Veteran appealed to the Board.  In a December 2019 decision, the Board recharacterized the issue of entitlement to service connection for a heart disability as "including hypertension."  Notably, the Board found that the evidence of record did not support a finding that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during his service in Thailand.  In March 2020, the Veteran subsequently filed a supplemental claim of service connection for a heart disability "including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease and hypertension."  The prior denial of service connection for atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease was confirmed and continued in a September 2021 rating decision.  However, it is not clear why the RO did not address hypertension in that rating decision particularly because hypertension is specifically noted as part of the service connection claim for a heart disability in the December 2019 Board decision and, in the Veteran's March 2020 supplemental claim.  

The Veteran appealed the September 2021 rating decision to the Board via an April 2022 NOD.  The appeal was docketed as 220408-235004.  In May 2022, the Board confirmed the prior denial of claims of service connection for atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease (as well as two unrelated service-connection claims), finding that new and relevant evidence had not been received to warrant readjudication of the previously denied claims.  The Veteran appealed that determination to the Court, and in a September 2022 Order, the Court vacated the May 2022 decision and granted a JMR because the parties agreed that the new evidence submitted with the Veteran's March 2020 supplemental claim was, in fact, relevant.  Accordingly, the JMR directed the Board to readjudicate the claims of service connection for coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation (and the other two unrelated claims) on the merits.  

Meanwhile, on October 31, 2022, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File a claim for compensation. 

In a February 2023 decision, the Board initially determined, pursuant to the directives set forth in the September 2022 JMR, that new and relevant evidence had been received to warrant readjudication of, inter alia, "service connection for a heart disability, including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension."  The claim was thereafter denied on the merits.  Notably, the February 2023 decision correctly characterized the claim as a claim of service connection for a heart disability to include atrial fibrillation, CAD and hypertension.  The Veteran appealed the February 2023 Board denial to the Court.  In a December 2023 Order, the Court vacated the February 2023 Board decision and granted a November 2023 JMPR directing the Board to consider the Veteran's claim of service connection for, inter alia, "a heart disability to include atrial fibrillation, CAD and hypertension" pursuant to the PACT Act which became effective on August 10, 2022.  

Meanwhile, just days after receiving the February 27, 2023 notice of the Board denial, on March 6, 2023, the Veteran inexplicably filed a separate VA Form 526EZ original claim of service connection for hypertension, even though it is now clear that the Veteran intended to appeal the February 2023 Board decision, under docket number 220408-235004, which included a claim of service connection for a heart disability, including hypertension, to the Court.  

Although the issue of service connection for hypertension was already part of a pending JMPR, the AOJ nevertheless accepted the concurrent election as a new claim of service connection for hypertension, and, in a June 2023 rating decision, granted service connection for hypertension, effective from October 31, 2022, the date of the Veteran's Intent To File noted above.  In September 2023, the Veteran initially requested a higher-level review of the effective date assigned for the grant of service connection for hypertension.  As noted above, in the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the higher-level reviewer granted an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension based on the regulations governing effective dates based on liberalizing laws.  The Veteran appealed the January 2024 higher-level review rating decision on January 16, 2025, and the instant appeal was docketed at the Board based on the date of the January 2025 NOD.  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Veteran did, in fact, appeal the February 2023 denial of service connection for a heart disability to include atrial fibrillation, CAD and hypertension, to the Court, and as noted above, the Court vacated the February 2023 decision and granted a November 2023 JMPR directing the Board to adjudicate the claims pursuant to the PACT Act.  In a June 4, 2024 decision, the Board granted service connection for atrial fibrillation and CAD, and specifically limited the grant as such based on a finding that the June 2023 hypertension grant with an effective date of August 10, 2022 was considered a full grant of benefits sought on appeal as to that portion of the claim of service connection for a heart disability.  As such, the June 7, 2024 implementing rating decision did not include the issue of hypertension in its assignment of the initial effective date of August 10, 2022 effective date for the atrial fibrillation and CAD.  The AOJ subsequently issued a "revised" rating decision addressing the initial ratings assigned for, inter alia, the service-connected "coronary artery disease with acute, subacute or old myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary hypertension" following evidence obtained from a VA examination.  

On January 10, 2025, the Veteran appealed the initial ratings and effective dates assigned for disabilities addressed in the revised July 2024 rating decision.  On January 16, 2025, the Veteran separately appealed the January 2024 higher-level review rating decision asserting that an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, is warranted for the grant of service connection for hypertension.  

The Veteran also appealed the June 2024 Board decision to the Court.  In a February 2025 JMPR, the parties agreed that a vacate is warranted for that part of the June 2024 Board decision that "denied entitlement to service connection for a heart disability to include atrial fibrillation and CAD due to herbicide exposure" on a basis other than pursuant to the PACT Act.  In essence, the JMPR took issue with the Board's June 2024 finding that the Veteran's appeal of service connection for hypertension, which had an effective date of August 10, 2022, had been granted in full.  The parties also agreed that the June 2024 Board decision that granted service connection for a heart disability, "to include hypertension" failed to address whether it had complied with the November 2023 JMPR's directives which included addressing potentially favorable evidence that may have entitled the Veteran to an effective date of service connection for a heart disability based on direct service connection prior to August 10, 2022.  In so doing, the JMPR also found that the lack of such analysis renders the Board's statement of reasons and bases inadequate and that remand is warranted for the Board to discuss whether it substantially complied with the terms of the November 2023 JMPR.  

Nevertheless, as the sole issue on appeal in the present case stems from a March 2023 service connection claim for hypertension, and the June 2023 rating decision that granted service connection for hypertension, the analysis below is limited to the evidence of record in the present appeal stream under docket number 250116-504416.  Any claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date based on the May 2017 service connection claim for a heart disability (including hypertension) is premature as the issue of entitlement to service connection for a heart disability on a direct (pre-PACT Act) basis remains pending under docket number 220408-235004.

Effective Dates

Generally, and except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If a claim for disability compensation, i.e., service connection, is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of the grant of service connection is the day following separation from service or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  

The phrase "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation.  However, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has interpreted it as, the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, as determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  As such, an effective date generally can be no earlier than the "facts found;" and "these 'facts found' include the date the disability first manifested" as well as "the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation."  See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 51 (2011) (citing 38 U.S.C § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400).  Thus, were a veteran to file a claim for benefits before "he actually had the disability," the effective date for the benefits sought would be no earlier than the date his disability first manifested (or the date entitlement arose if it is after the date the claim was filed).  See DeLisio, 25 Vet. App at 52 (citations omitted); see also Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

A claimant may submit a VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File, and VA will recognize the receipt date of the Intent to File a claim as the date of claim, so long as VA receives a successfully completed claim form within one year of receipt of the Intent to File.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  An Intent to File must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension), but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based.  Id.  A Veteran may also preserve the date of claim by continuously pursuing a claim under the method prescribed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension 

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an effective date of April 17, 2017, for the grant of service connection for hypertension because he continuously pursued his claim for service connection for a heart disability, to include hypertension, since VA received his April 2017 Intent to File.  See January 2025 VA Form 10182.  The Veteran also asserts that he is entitled to an earlier effective date because a March 2023 VA medical examination shows he has been diagnosed with hypertension since at least June 2008.  Id.  The Veteran further asserts that the January 2024 rating decision on appeal was not a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal because the AOJ granted service connection for hypertension on a presumptive basis, pursuant to the PACT Act, but did not consider whether service connection is warranted on a direct basis based on his service in Thailand, prior to the effective date of the PACT Act, which, if found, would afford the Veteran an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for hypertension.  However, the Veteran acknowledges that the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for a heart disability, to include hypertension, is currently pending before the Board in a separate appeal stream under docket number 220408-235004.  Id.  Additionally, in his September 2023 higher-level review request, in the present appeal stream, the Veteran asserted that he was entitled to an effective date of August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for hypertension, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, because his initial claim for service connection for hypertension under docket number 250116-504416 was filed within a year of the enactment of the PACT Act.  

As noted above, the issue of whether service connection for a heart disability, to include hypertension, is warranted on a direct (pre-PACT Act) basis is pending before the Board in a separate appeal stream under docket number 220408-235004.  Therefore, the question of whether the Veteran continuously pursued his service connection claim for a heart disability, to include hypertension, since April 2017 is not at issue in the present appeal under docket number 250116-504416.  

Based on the evidence of record in the present appeal stream, an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, is not warranted for the grant of service connection for hypertension, as the date of claim is later than the effective date of the PACT Act.  

Turning to the evidence of record, a March 2023 VA medical examination report shows the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension as early as June 2008.  As such, the date entitlement arose for service connection for hypertension is in June 2008.  

The date of claim for service connection for hypertension is October 31, 2022.  By way of history, the Veteran filed an October 31, 2022, Intent to file at the AOJ, followed by a claim for service connection for hypertension, which VA received in March 2023.  Following the June 2023 rating decision, which granted service connection for hypertension and assigned a noncompensable disability rating, effective from October 31, 2022, the Veteran filed a September 2023 higher-level review request, which resulted in the January 2024 decision on appeal that granted an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, but continued the noncompensable disability rating for the service-connected hypertension.  As the Veteran continuously pursued his claim for an earlier effective date since he filed the October 2022 Intent to File, the date of claim for the service-connected hypertension is October 31, 2022.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

Generally, the Veteran would be entitled to an effective date of October 31, 2022, as the date of claim is later than the date entitlement arose to service connection for hypertension.  However, pursuant to the regulation governing liberalizing laws, 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(1), the January 2024 AOJ decision granted an effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension because the Veteran's claim was filed within one year from the effective date of the PACT Act.  Thus, the Veteran has already received the earliest possible effective date for the grant of service connection for hypertension in the present appeal stream based on the liberalizing law regulations, and an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, is not warranted on that basis.  

As noted above, the issue of whether service connection for hypertension on a direct basis prior to the August 10, 2022 PACT Act effective date is on appeal in another appeal stream pending adjudication and a decision will be forthcoming under separate cover.
