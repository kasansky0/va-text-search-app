ORDER

Entitlement to additional Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program of Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (Post-9/11 GI Bill or Chapter 33) is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was not on active duty when he enrolled in a program of education under Chapter 33 for the school term from November 19, 2019, to April 13, 2020; he applied for and was awarded additional benefits under VA's Yellow Ribbon Program.  

2. The Veteran was called to active duty with the United States Marine Corps Reserve (USMC-R) from October 15, 2019, to October 14, 2020. 

3. Since Veteran was on active duty at the time he pursued his program of education, he is not entitled to additional educational assistance benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to additional VA educational assistance benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program of Chapter 33, prior to August 1, 2022, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3311, 3313, 3317(2020); 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520, 21.9700.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from October 2005 to February 2017.  The Veteran had additional service with the USMC-R, to include a period of active duty from October 2019 to October 2020.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2020 Higher-Level of a May 2020 rating decision of VA's Veterans Benefits Administration, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied entitlement to additional VA educational assistance benefits under the Yellow Ribbon program of the Post-9/11 GI Bill.  VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement (NOD), in July 2020, wherein the Veteran requested the Board's hearing docket.  The Veteran subsequently testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in March 2024.  A transcript of that proceeding is of record.

Evidentiary Windows

The Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue on appeal, evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the Board hearing, to include testimony provided at the hearing; and evidence submitted within 90 days following the Board hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300(a), 302(a).  If additional evidence was submitted between the dates of the AOJ decision and the hearing, the Board will not consider it unless it is resubmitted during the 90 days following the Board hearing.  If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Entitlement to additional VA educational assistance benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program of Chapter 33. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to back pay under VA's Yellow Ribbon Program, for the period October 15, 2019, to October 14, 2020, when he continued to be enrolled in a program of education under Chapter 33 but was ordered back to active duty.  The question before the Board is whether the Veteran was entitled to additional VA educational assistance benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 3317(a), while on active duty with the USMC-R, prior to August 1, 2022.

The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides for VA educational assistance for members of the Armed Forces based on active-duty service after September 10, 2001.  38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520.  Veterans are eligible for Chapter 33 education benefits if they served a minimum of 90 aggregate days on active-duty after September 10, 2001, and separated from active-duty service with an honorable discharge. 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.9505, 21.9520.

VA's Yellow Ribbon Program was established to provide additional educational assistance benefits to cover portions of the tuition and fees that exceed the base Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fees benefits as set forth under 38 U.S.C. § 3313(c)(1)(A).  The Yellow Ribbon Program payment is paid equally by the institutions of higher learning (IHL) and VA.  The program allows schools to enter into agreements with VA to match a certain amount of the tuition and fees not otherwise covered by the basic Post-9/11 GI Bill.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3317(2020); see also ERIC - ED617512 - The Post-9/11 GI Bill: A Primer. CRS Report R42755, Version 22. Updated, Congressional Research Service, 2021-Sep-23.  

38 U.S.C. § 3317 also provides that the Yellow Ribbon program shall only apply to covered individuals described in paragraphs (1), (2), (9), and (10) of section 3311(b).  These subsections specifically describe various scenarios in which individuals are entitled to the 100 percent rate of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.  With particular relevance to the facts of this case, 38 U.S.C. § 3311(b)(1), which exclusively pertains to eligibility at the 100 percent rate and not entitlement to additional benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program, requires individuals an aggregate of at least 36 months on active duty and after completion of such service, to either continue on active duty or have been honorably discharged or released from active duty.  

There is no dispute that the Veteran's military service entitled him to Chapter 33 educational assistance.  After September 10, 2001, the Veteran completed the necessary service for basic eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.  See, i.e., March 6, 2019, Certificate of Eligibility.   

By way of background, the Veteran enrolled in a program of education under Chapter 33 for the school term from November 19, 2019, to April 13, 2020.  The Veteran also applied for additional benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program.  See Enrollment Certification (VA Form 22-1999) received on March 20, 2020.  A VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR) report generated in connection with his enrollment reflected, however, that the Veteran was called to active duty with the USMC-R from October 15, 2019, to October 14, 2020. 

In a May 2020 decision, the AOJ notified the Veteran that VA received his query regarding his Yellow Ribbon Program payments for his enrollment in a program of education from November 19, 2019, to April 13, 2020.  The AOJ notified the Veteran that active duty members and spouses of active duty members eligible for Transfer of Entitlement are not eligible for Yellow Ribbon payments.  The AOJ explained that the Yellow Ribbon Program, codified under 38 U.S.C. § 3317, only applied to additional tuition and fee costs "not covered" by payments issued exclusively "under section 3313(c)(1)(A)" 38 U.S.C. § 3317 for individuals eligible at the 100 percent level.  Since the payments of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits to students on active duty, as it is the Veteran's case, are specifically controlled under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 3313(e), and because 38 U.S.C. § 3317 only allows additional payments but for students specifically meeting the requirements under section 3313(c)(1)(A), entitlement to additional educational assistance benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program was not warranted.  The AOJ further explained that according to Section 104 of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public Law (P.L.) 115-48, enacted on August 16, 2017), also known as the Forever GI Bill, the Yellow Ribbon Program would be extended to active duty service members and their spouses, effective August 1, 2022.  The AOJ indicated that this benefit was not retroactive.  

The Board has considered the Veteran's arguments in support of his claim, to include his oral testimony during his March 2024 Board hearing.  However, for the reasons set forth below, additional payments under the Yellow Ribbon Program for a program of education pursued from November 2019 to April 2020, while serving on active duty with the USMC-R, are not warranted. 

First, Section 104 of P.L. 115-48 expanded the Yellow Ribbon Program, in pertinent part, to servicemembers on active duty as set forth under 38 U.S.C. § 3313(e)(2)(A) which, as noted above, is the controlling statute for the payment of Chapter 33 benefits for individuals serving on active duty, but only for enrollments beginning on or after August 1, 2022.  Section 104 specifically reads "Inclusion of certain members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty in Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement program."  The clear text of Section 104 of P.L. 115-48 reads as follows: 

(a)	IN GENRAL-Section 3317(a), is amended, in the first sentence, by striking "section 3313(c)(1)(A) and inserting "subsection (c)(1)(A) or (e)(2)(A) of section 3313 of this title.

(b)	EFFECTIVE DATE-The amendment made by subsection (a) 

shall take effect on August 1, 2022.

See Section 104, P.L. 115-48, August 16, 2017.  

In other words, prior to August 1, 2022, additional benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program were only available to individuals at the 100 percent rate of educational assistance benefits of Chapter 33 as set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 3313(c)(1)(A) as explained above.  Nonetheless, through the enactment of P.L. 115-48, Congress expressly extended eligibility to Yellow Ribbon payments to individuals or spouses of servicemembers on active duty pursuant to subsection 38 U.S.C. § (e)(2)(A), but only for enrollments on or after August 1, 2022.  

The Board finds that it was Congress's clear intent that additional Yellow Ribbon payments to active duty servicemembers and their spouses to whom benefits were transferred were expressly intended to take effect on August 1, 2022, and not earlier.  See The Post-9/11 GI Bill: A Primer. CRS Report R42755, Updated, Congressional Research Service, August 1, 2018, and September 23, 2021.        

The Veteran's main contention, in essence, is that that the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions in 2020 were vague and that he met the requirements for the Yellow Ribbon Program regardless of his active duty status.  See hearing transcript, p.6.   He asserts that according to the 2020 version of 38 U.S.C. § 3317, he is still an individual who, commencing on or after September 11, 2001, served an aggregate of at least 36 months on active duty in the Armed Forces and, after completion of such service, was discharge with an honorable discharge.  Therefore, he contends he meets the requirements set forth under 38 U.S.C. § 3311(b)(1), as required by Section 3317(a). The Veteran asserts that the fact that he was called to active duty in 2019 as a reservist should not serve as a basis for disentitlement of the additional payments under the Yellow Ribbon Program.  

In that regard, the Board clarifies that 38 U.S.C. § 3311(b)(1) strictly refers to basic eligibility requirements for entitlement to Chapter 33 benefits at the 100 percent rate, but not an automatic entitlement to additional payments under the Yellow Ribbon Program.  The controlling authority for the eligibility under the Yellow Ribbon Program is 38 U.S.C. § 3317(a).  In passing the Harry W. Colmery Act of 2017, Congress specifically expanded the Yellow Ribbon Program to active duty servicemembers eligible at the 100 percent benefit level by specifically adding to 38 U.S.C. § 3317(a), subsection (e)(2)(A) of 38 U.S.C. § 3313.  This subsection specifically addresses the additional payment of benefits for "Programs of Education Leading to a Degree Pursued [while] on Active Duty on More Than Half-time Basis."  That section was not for consideration for the Yellow Ribbon Program under 38 U.S.C. § 3317 before August 1, 2022.  

Additionally, Congress clear intent to prospectively expand the Yellow Ribbon Program to active duty servicemembers is evidenced by the Congressional Research Service on the Post-9/11 GI Bill: A Primer, on its August 1, 2018, September 23, 2021, and May 24, 2024, updates as discussed above.  The report unambiguously indicates that the program is available only to participants who are at the 100 percent benefit level, but that prior to August 1, 2022, "[s]ervicemembers on active duty and their spouses are not eligible." See https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED617512.pdf, p.19, n.70 (the report also confirms that P.L. 115-48 expands availability to include active duty servicemembers at the 100 percent benefit level and the spouses of active duty servicemembers effective August 1, 2022).  See also (CRS) on the Post-9/11 GI Bill: A Primer, updated on May 24, 2024, p.21, n.78, accessed through https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42755.  A simple read of the foregoing serves as clear guidance that Congress's expansion of the program to servicemembers on active duty did not exist prior to the enactment of P.L. 115-48 and that although the expansion is now in effect, it was not to be applied retroactively, but only for enrollments that occurred on or after August 1, 2022.  

The Board is grateful for the Veteran's honorable service in the USMC and is sympathetic to his contentions in that he believes he is entitled to additional educational assistance benefits under the Yellow Ribbon Program of Chapter 33.  Unfortunately, there is no provision that allows for payment of additional Yellow Ribbon Program benefits for individuals who served on active duty prior to August 1, 2022.  Thus, despite the Veteran's arguments and request, the Board lacks the legal authority to award benefits outside the scope of the law and has no authority to grant claims on an equitable basis. 38 U.S.C. § 7104.  No equities, no matter how compelling, can create a right to payment out of the United States Treasury that has not been provided for by Congress. Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994).   

For the reasons discussed above, the claim of entitlement to additional educational assistance benefits under the Yellow Ribbon program of Chapter 33, prior to August 1, 2022, must be denied as a matter of law.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
