ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for stress fracture, right foot 3rd metatarsal is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for stress fracture, left foot 3rd metatarsal is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's foot disabilities are manifested by moderate symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for stress fracture, right foot 3rd metatarsal have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5284 (2024).

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for stress fracture, left foot 3rd metatarsal have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5284 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service from October 2006 to February 2007.? 

These matters are before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal of an October 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).? 

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.?Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. §?20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.? 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. §?3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating - Right & Left Foot Disabilities

The Veteran asserts that they should have higher ratings for their foot disabilities as their symptoms are worse than those contemplated by the currently assigned ratings.

For the period on appeal, the Veteran has been assigned a 10 percent rating for each foot pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5284. Under Diagnostic Code 5284, a 10 percent rating is warranted when a foot injury is productive of a moderate disability, a 20 percent rating is warranted when a foot injury is productive of a moderately severe disability, and a 30 percent rating is warranted when a foot injury is productive of a severe disability. A maximum rating of 40 percent may be assigned if loss of use of a foot is demonstrated.

Words such as "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decision is "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6 (2018). With this principle in mind, the term "moderate" is generally defined as "of average or medium quality, amount, scope, range, etc." and the term "severe" is generally defined as "extremely intense." See Webster's New World Dictionary, Third College Edition, 871, 1071 (1988).

At an August 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported that their feet swell, and they have difficulty standing, walking, sitting, and navigating stairs. The Veteran endorsed flare-ups that were moderate in severity, last 8-10 hours at a time, and are precipitated by using their feet. Upon physical examination, the examiner noted that there was no pain during the examination; however, the Veteran's reports of pain with prolonged activity were noted. The examiner also noted that swelling, interference with standing, and pain were contributing factors of the Veteran's disability.

At a January 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that their feet hurt daily, and the pain worsens throughout the day. They reported difficulty weight-bearing, aching feet, and a limp. The Veteran denied flare-ups. Upon physical examination, the examiner noted that the only symptoms the Veteran experienced was extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces and physical pain in both feet. The examiner identified swelling, interference with standing, and pain as contributing factors of disability. The examiner stated that the Veteran's feet were swollen during the examination, that standing caused the Veteran pain, that the Veteran could not walk over 50 feet without pain, that the Veteran could not navigate stairs without pain, and that their disability required the use of shoe inserts.

A review of the record shows that the Veteran received periodic treatment for their foot disabilities. However, a review of the treatment notes of record do not show the Veteran to have symptoms worse than those reported at their VA examinations.

The Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a rating in excess of 10 percent for either their left or right foot disability. In this regard, while the Veteran experiences pain in their feet, the functional limitations of their foot disabilities do not more nearly approximate moderately severe limitation. The evidence also does not indicate that the Veteran's condition warrants the use of an ambulating device and they have not been prescribed specialized orthotics related to their disability. Physical examination findings show pain, and the Veteran does report compromised weight-bearing as a result of their foot disabilities, but there is no indication from the record that such has more than a moderate impact on the Veteran's balance or propulsion, as evidenced by the fact that the Veteran does not require any assistive devices for ambulation as a result of their foot disabilities. Additionally, while the Veteran is limited in their ability to perform certain activities such standing or walking for prolonged periods, that limitation is accounted for by the currently assigned rating for a moderate disability. Accordingly, the Board concludes that even with consideration of all pertinent disability factors, there remains no basis for the assignment of a rating in excess of 10 percent for either the right or left foot disability. Therefore, the Board finds that a higher rating is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5284.

The Board has considered assigning a higher, or separate rating under another diagnostic code pertaining to the foot. However, the Veteran's service-connected foot disabilities do not include plantar fasciitis, flat foot, weak foot, claw foot, malunion or nonunion of tarsal or metatarsal bones, metatarsalgia, hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, or hammertoe. Thus, Diagnostic Codes 5269, 5276, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5280, 5281, 5282, and 5283 are not for application. Additionally, there is no evidence that the Veteran experiences arthritis in either foot that has resulted in limitation of motion, and thus, a rating under Diagnostic Code 5003 is not for application.

Consideration has been given to assigning staged ratings. However, at no time during the period in question has the disability warranted a higher schedular rating than that assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable as the evidence is not in approximate balance, and entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent each for the right and left foot disabilities is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) (2018); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
