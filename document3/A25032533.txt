DOCKET NO. 211012-190444
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of April 16, 1999, but no earlier, for service connection for foot conditions to include bilateral pes planus, bilateral plantar fasciitis, bilateral pes cavus, bilateral metatarsalgia, and right foot stress fracture (a bilateral foot disability) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of April 16, 1999, but no earlier, for service connection for lupus with diffusely distributed scaly pruritic exanthemata (lupus) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran separated from service on April 15, 1999.

2. On May 14, 1999, a claim seeking service connection for a bilateral foot disability and lupus was received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 

3. The Veteran did not appeal the January 2002 rating decision that denied service connection for a bilateral foot disability and lupus on the basis that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) were unavailable, and that no in-service incurrence was shown in the record; this rating decision became final.

4. The Veteran did not file a substantive appeal to the August 2004 Statement of the Case (SOC) that denied the application to reopen the claims on the basis that new and material evidence was not received; the August 2003 rating decision from which the August 2004 SOC originated became final.

5. VA received the Veteran's STRs in November 2004.

6. The finality of the prior rating decisions is vitiated based on the subsequent receipt of relevant STRs in November 2004.

7. The claim remained open and pending since originally filed in May 1999.

8. The claims were granted based at least in part on these STRs.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of April 16, 1999, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for a bilateral foot disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date of April 16, 1999, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for lupus have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1996 to October 1996 and September 1997 to April 1999.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2021 higher-level review (HLR) rating decision following a June 2020 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the October 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2020 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board finds that entitlement to a TDIU has been raised by the record in association with the claims. Therefore, the Board has added a claim of entitlement to a TDIU, as reflected on the title page. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). 

Next, the Board acknowledges that a copy of the Board Docketing letter sent to the Veteran was returned as undeliverable mail in December 2021. However, review of the claims file reflects that VA sent a copy to an updated address in December 2021, and this was not returned as undeliverable mail. The claims file also reflects that a copy was sent to the representative. 

As a final preliminary matter, the Board acknowledges the June 2020 Correspondence requesting "expedited handling." To the extent that this may be deemed a motion to advance this appeal on the Board's docket, it is denied. The record does not reflect a level of severe financial hardship or serious illness as required by the regulation governing advancement on the docket. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.800, 20.902(c). 

Entitlement to an effective date of April 16, 1999, but no earlier, for service connection for a bilateral foot disability is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of April 16, 1999, but no earlier, for service connection for lupus is granted.

The Veteran seeks to vitiate the finality of prior rating decisions that denied service connection for lupus and a bilateral foot disability and obtain an earlier effective date of April 16, 1999. See April 2020 Third Party Correspondence and October 2021 VA Form 10182. For the reasons set out below, the Board agrees with the Veteran's assertions and finds that an earlier effective date of April 16, 1999, is warranted.

In general, the effective date of an award of service connection will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

If a claim is received within one year after separation from service, then the effective date shall be "day following separation from active service." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

A "claim" is a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a specific VA benefit submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Regulations defining a "claim" were revised, effective March 24, 2015. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014). The revision eliminated informal claims and required claims on a form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151(a), 3.155, 3.160. The revised regulation allows a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Prior to March 24, 2015, an informal claim may be any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under VA law; an informal claim must be written, and it must identify the benefit being sought. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.155(a) (2008) (repealed 2015); Thomas v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 197 (2002); Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 80 (U.S. 2009) ("Thus, it follows that (1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing are the essential requirements of any claim, whether formal or informal").

While "the date entitlement arose" is not defined in statute or regulation, the Court has interpreted this term as the date the claimant met the requirements for the benefit sought. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

The laws and regulations governing additional aspects of earlier effective dates were further amended during the pendency of this appeal.

In February 2019, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), came into effect. The AMA created a new framework for veterans seeking review of VA's decisions on their claims. Although a new framework was established, the existing framework under the "Legacy" system was not eliminated. Rather, the AMA and Legacy systems operate concurrently.

The changes enacted by the AMA included a new standard for reviewing previously denied claims, which replaced the one existing under the Legacy system. Under the Legacy system, the standard was one for "new and material" evidence; the AMA lowered that standard to one for "new and relevant" evidence.

Under the Legacy system, in general, an AOJ determination that is not appealed within one year becomes a final decision, which may only be reopened with a showing of new and material evidence. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5108, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d), 19.2, 20.1103.

However, exceptions to finality exist. At any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider that original claim on a de novo basis. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1).

Indeed, under such circumstances, VA is required to reconsider the claim de novo. See Kisor v. Shulkin,?869 F.3d 1360?(Fed. Cir. 2017); George v. Shulkin,?29?Vet. App.?199?(2017);?38?C.F.R. §?3.156(c). The purpose of this exception is to put the veteran in the same position he or she would have been in had VA considered the records in the first place. Blubaugh v. McDonald,?773 F.3d 1310, 1313?(Fed. Cir. 2014). The term "relevant" in the context of section 3.156(c)(1) means noncumulative and pertinent to the matter at issue in the case. See Kisor,?869 F.3d at 1368-69. Where the newly obtained records do not remedy the defects of the prior claim and contain facts that were never in question, they are not "relevant" within the meaning of?38?C.F.R. §?3.156(c)(1).?Id.?at 1368-69 citing Blubaugh,?777 F.3d at 1314. 

If upon reconsideration, VA makes an award based "all or in part" on these newly associated service department records, the assigned effective date will be "the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later." 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3); Mayhue v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 273, 279 (2011). 

The Board now turns to the procedural history of the claim.

The Veteran separated from his second period of service on April 15, 1999.

On May 14, 1999, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526 (Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension), seeking service connection for a right foot fracture and bilateral foot condition, as well as lupus. In August 2000, the AOJ secured a formal finding of unavailability for the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e). In an August 2000 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection on the basis that no in-service incident was shown and noting that no STRs were available for review. The Veteran filed an application to reopen the claim within the one-year appeal period in December 2000. The AOJ denied service connection on the merits in a January 2002 rating decision, noting that the STRs were unavailable. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201 (2012); 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (prior to March 24, 2015, VA recognized the submission of informal NODs).  

The Veteran did not appeal the January 2002 rating decision, and no evidence was received within one year of the rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). Accordingly, the January 2002 rating decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §20.1103. 

The Veteran filed an application to reopen the claim in February 2003. The AOJ denied the claim to reopen in an August 2003 rating decision on the basis that there was no new and material evidence received sufficient to reopen the claim. The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) in May 2004, and the AOJ denied the application in an August 2004 statement of the case (SOC) on the basis that no new and material evidence was received. No substantive appeal was filed.

Under the Legacy system, appellate review was initiated by an NOD and completed by a substantive appeal filed after an SOC was furnished to an appellant. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(a); 38 C.F.R. § 19.20. A substantive appeal must be filed within 60 days from the date of mailing of an SOC, or within the remainder of the one-year period from the date of mailing of the notification of the determination being appealed, whichever period ends later. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 19.52(b)(1). In the absence of a properly perfected appeal, the AOJ may close the appeal and the decision becomes final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(3); Roy v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 554, 556 (1993); 38 C.F.R. § 19.32. The AOJ did so in this case, as evidenced by the fact that it did not certify to the Board the issue of entitlement to service connection for lupus or a bilateral foot disability following the August 2004 SOC. No further action was taken by VA to suggest that this issue was on appeal. Accordingly, the August 2003 rating decision from which the August 2004 SOC originated became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

On October 31, 2005, the Veteran filed the present application to reopen the claim. The AOJ denied the application to reopen in an October 2006 rating decision on the basis that there was no new and material evidence received sufficient to reopen the claim. The Veteran filed a timely NOD in February 2007, and the AOJ denied the claim in a February 2007 SOC on the basis no new and material evidence was received. The Veteran filed a timely substantive appeal in March 2007.

In June 2010, the Board found that the exception to finality pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) was for application in the present case. Specifically, the Board found that STRs were received by VA in November 2004, following the August 2003 rating decision and August 2004 SOC. Accordingly, the Board would review the issues on a de novo basis. 

The Board then remanded the claims of entitlement to service connection for lupus and a bilateral foot disability for the AOJ to readjudicate the issues on appeal following the receipt of STRs in November 2004. Subsequently, the Board remanded the service connection claims in July 2012, December 2013, and July 2017. In September 2018, the Board granted service connection for lupus and remanded the bilateral foot disability claim. In a June 2020 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for a bilateral foot disability and assigned an effective date of October 31, 2005, for both the awards of service connection for a bilateral foot disability and lupus.

The Board notes that, in the December 2013 remand, it had noted that the claims file consisted of a paper file and electronic file. The Board further notes that, prior to the electronic uploading of evidence within claims files, evidence within paper files was date stamped on the day that it was received. When VA converted from paper files to the electronic system, evidence was converted from paper files to electronic files, in the order the paper files were received. Thus, the date that the document was marked received was normally associated with that date stamp on that document. Here, the Veteran's STRs are clearly stamped as received on November 23, 2004. Accordingly, it is evident that the STRs were received by VA after the August 2004 SOC. Furthermore, they show treatment for foot complaints and complaints of other joint pain. Therefore, and as set out in prior remands and decision, they are relevant to the claim. Thus, the Board finds that the finality of the prior rating decisions is vitiated, and the claim has remained open and pending since it was originally filed in May 1999.  Finally, the claims were granted at least in part based on these STRs.

The date of filing is May 14, 1999. The record shows that the Veteran separate from service on April 15, 1999. Accordingly, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2), the effective date will be April 16, 1999, which is the day following separation from active service, as the claim was received well within one year of separation from service. 

The Board does not find that an effective date even earlier than this one is warranted. There is no legal authority for the assignment of an effective date prior to the day after his separation from active service. Neither the Veteran nor his representative have presented or identified any argument or evidence that supports the grant of an even earlier effective date, nor is any evident to the Board upon review of the record. In sum, after review of the record, the Board does not find that an even earlier effective date is warranted as the earliest possible effective date has been assigned herein. 

In sum, the effective date of the award of service connection for the Veteran's bilateral foot disability and lupus shall be April 16, 1999. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). To the extent that the Veteran asserts entitlement to an earlier effective date, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim; there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved; and any further increased rating is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

The Board finds that a remand is warranted for correction of an error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, as correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. 

The Veteran expressly listed "Entitlement to TDIU" in the April 2021 HLR request in response to the June 2020 rating decision, where the AOJ implemented the grant of service connection for lupus and awarded service connection for the bilateral foot disability in the first instance following remand, and also awarded effective dates and initial ratings for both disabilities. Pre-decisional evidence also raises the issue of unemployability due to the service-connected lupus.  See, e.g., November and October 2020 VA treatment records.  The Board notes that TDIU can be informally raised pursuant to Rice and essentially constitutes a claim for an increased or total rating. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 454-455 (2009). 

In view of the foregoing, remand is necessary to provide adequate notice of the requirements to substantiate a claim for TDIU. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Send the Veteran a VA Form 21-8940, Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, and an appropriate notification letter.
