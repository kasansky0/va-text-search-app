ORDER

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his hearing loss is attributable to his active-duty service 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1976 to February 1979.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service Connection

Generally, to establish service connection a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Service connection may be established for a current disability on the basis of a presumption that certain chronic diseases, to include organic diseases of the nervous system, manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after service must have had their onset in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a). For organic diseases of the nervous system, the disease must have manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(3).

In deciding the Veteran's claim, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event; or whether the persuasive evidence of record is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.

Bilateral Hearing Loss

The Board notes that the rating decision on appeal contained a favorable finding that noise exposure in-service has been conceded and also that the Veteran had diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss. The Board is bound by these findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). The Board also notes that the Veteran is service connected for tinnitus. See June 2024 rating decision. 

The issue presented to the Board, then, is whether a nexus between the Veteran's hearing loss his in-service noise exposure exists.

The Board recognizes that a February 2020 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's hearing loss was not at least as likely as not caused by or as a result of military noise exposure. The examiner's opinion was based on the lack of in-service documented hearing loss and the lack of hearing threshold shift evidenced during service. The examiner did document that there was no post-service noise exposure.

Although the Board has considered the VA examiner's opinion, the Board affords the VA examiner's opinion little probative weight. The Board is mindful that the absence of in-service evidence of disability during service is not always fatal to a service connection claim. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). Furthermore, service connection is not precluded if there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a relationship between the appellant's service and a current disability which satisfies 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App.

The Veteran himself is of the opinion that a link exists between his current hearing loss and active service. See January 2023 Statement in Support of Claim. While a lay person, he is capable of opining on medical questions that fall within the realm of common knowledge. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 438 (2011). Specifically, hearing loss may be observed and described by a lay person. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanon v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). 

Additionally, the Veteran submitted a private examination audiological report which stated that the Veteran's hearing loss was related to acoustic trauma. See July 2024 private medical record.

Any doubt regarding the onset of the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss must be resolved in the Veteran's favor. Thus, though the Veteran's private medical record did not contain a rationale for the relation of hearing loss to acoustic trauma, the Board finds that the medical opinion in combination with the Veteran's assertion that his hearing loss is related to his conceded in-service acoustic trauma to be of probative value. As such, the negative medical opinion of record is outweighed by the Veteran's statement and the private medical opinion. Additionally, the Board is reminded that seeking negative evidence against the Veteran is prohibited by VA law. See Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).

Therefore, the Board notes the probative evidence of record and finds that the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss is related to his active-duty service. Accordingly, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted. See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); see also 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.
