ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and knee strain ("a right knee disability"), prior to November 27, 2018 is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for a right knee disability from November 27, 2018 is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee instability as of April 17, 2015 is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. Prior to November 27, 2018 the Veteran's right knee disability has been characterized by painful motion; limitation of flexion to 30 degrees, limitation of extension to 15 degrees, a combination of limitation of flexion and limitation of extension, favorable ankylosis of the knee at full extension or in slight flexion between 0 and 10 degrees have not been shown.

2. From November 27, 2018, the Veteran's right knee strain has been characterized by limitation of extension to 40 degrees; neither limitation of extension to 45 degrees nor ankylosis have been shown.

3. During the period reviewed, the Veteran's right knee instability has been no greater than moderate in severity.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and knee strain, prior to November 27, 2018, have not been met.   38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.1, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5260, 5261.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from December 1986 to December 1989.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400 (a)(1). Here, the Veteran submitted a timely October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, in which he elected the Direct docket. The claims on appeal are thus properly before the Board. Therefore, the Board may consider the evidence of record as of the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301.

Increased Ratings

Service connection for right knee instability was granted in a final January 1993 Rating Decision in which the RO assigned a 10 percent rating from November 8, 1989 and noncompensable from October 1, 1992.  In May 2000, the RO issued a Rating Decision assigned a 10 percent rating for right knee instability from September 7, 1999. In a final January 2005 Rating Decision, the RO denied an increased rating claim received in July 2004.   

In April 2015, the RO received the Veteran's Intent to File form, followed within a year by his March 2016 VA 21-526EZ.  In a June 2016 Rating Decision, the RO awarded service connection for right patellofemoral pain syndrome and knee strain, assigning a 10 percent rating from April 17, 2015 for painful motion.  In July 2016, within a year, the RO received the Veteran's NOD, claiming increased ratings for both right knee disabilities.  In January 2018, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 9 substantive appeal of a November 2017 Statement of the Case, appealing to the Board.  

In April 2019, the Board remanded the issue of entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 10 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and knee strain with painful flexion. In a July 2020 Rating Decision, the RO granted a rating of 40 percent from November 27, 2018, recharacterizing the disability as limitation of extension and assigning an initial rating under DC 5261 instead of DC 5260.

In March 2023, the Board again remanded the issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for a right knee disability prior to November 27, 2018, and entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 40 percent for a right knee disability after November 27, 2018.  In September 2023, after consideration of additional evidence, the RO granted service connection for right knee limitation of flexion, assigning a rating of noncompensable from September 13, 2023; notification was issued in October 2023.  In September 2023, the RO also issued a Supplemental SOC denying a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to November 27, 2018, and in excess of 40 percent from that date for right knee limitation of extension under DC 5261.  

In February 2024, the Board added and remanded the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee instability from April 17, 2015.  See February 21, 2024 Board Remand.  After additional development, those issues were denied in an October 30, 2024 SSOC.  However, in a December 2024 Rating Decision, the RO granted an increased rating of 20 percent for right knee instability from April 17, 2015. Accordingly, the Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate all three issues captioned above.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

When there is a question as to which of two separate evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria required for that particular rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In this regard, it should be noted that, during this appeal, the schedular criteria pertaining to knee instability under 38 C.F.R. §4.71a, DC 5257, was amended effective February 7, 2021. See 85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (November 30, 2020).  

Where a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a claim for increased rating, the Board should first determine whether application of the revised version would produce retroactive results. In particular, a new rule may not extinguish any rights or benefits the claimant had prior to enactment of the new rule. VAOPGCPREC 07-03 (November 19, 2003).

However, if the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. §5110; Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308, 313 (1991), overruled in part, Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). As the Veteran's claim was received prior to the effective date of the regulation changes, the Board must consider the Veteran's right knee disability under both the old and the revised rating criteria and must apply the old rating criteria if the result is more favorable to the Veteran. Id.

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and knee strain, prior to November 27, 2018,  

The Veteran asserts that his service-connected right knee disability is more disabling than reflected by the currently assigned disability ratings.

Knee disabilities are rated according to the varying types of functional impairments that may be present. Under Diagnostic Code 5260, limitation of knee flexion is rated 30 percent disabling where flexion is limited to 15 degrees; 20 percent disabling where flexion is limited to 30 degrees; 10 percent disabling where flexion is limited to 45 degrees; and noncompensable where flexion is limited to 60 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Diagnostic Code 5261 governs limitation of extension and provides for a noncompensable rating for extension limited to 5 degrees, 10 percent for extension limited to 10 degrees, 20 percent for a limitation to 15 degrees, 30 percent for a limitation to 20 degrees, 40 percent for extension limited to 30 degrees, and a maximum of 50 percent for a limitation to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.

In this case, a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to November 27, 2018 for the Veteran's right knee disability based upon limitation of extension is not warranted. Specifically, in an April 2016 VA examination, the Veteran reported difficulty with prolonged standing and walking, affecting physical employment. He had full initial range of motion.  He reported pain on flareups limiting extension to 120 degrees, and slightly diminished muscle strength.  There was no evidence of additional functional loss due to pain or repetitive testing in either knee. There was also no ankylosis or incapacitating episodes of arthritis of the right knee.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome and knee strain from November 27, 2018

In a legacy NOD received in July 2016 and a January 2018 substantive appeal, the Veteran complains of right knee instability, and indicates that this examination was inadequate because it was not thorough.  In December 2018, the Veteran presented for another VA examination.   

From November 27, 2018, the Veteran is in receipt of a 40 percent rating for right knee disability.  The Board finds that he is not entitled to the next highest 50 percent rating, as extension is not limited to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.  

The Veteran's November 2018 VA examiner observed pain on flexion and extension.  He reported flare ups of the knees during which variable increased pain and weakness limited flexion was difficult. On examination the Veteran exhibited right knee flexion and extension to 35 degrees, warranting the currently assigned 40 percent rating. The examiner noted pain and weakness on examination with flexion, extension, and on weight bearing. Additionally, no additional functional loss on repetitive testing or history of recurrent effusion was noted. There was no additional loss of motion which would support a rating in excess of 40 percent. The Board also notes the Veteran's apparent complaints of flare-ups after overuse of the joint, during which pain increased.  Unfortunately, however, the precise extent to which these flare-ups cause additional loss in range of motion was not recorded because the examiner felt that there was no way to estimate additional loss without directly observing the flareup.  In any event, based on the observed range of motion and the Veteran's statements, it does not appear that the next higher rating is for contemplation, even in such situations.

Next, the Veteran's September 2023 VA examiner observed pain on flexion and extension.  On examination the Veteran exhibited right knee flexion and extension to 65 degrees. Pain, fatigability, and weakness on flareups limited flexion to 60 degrees.  The examiner noted pain and weakness on examination with flexion, extension, and on weight bearing causing functional loss, but the evidence does not indicate that this functional loss approached limitation of extension to 45 degrees. No additional functional loss on repetitive testing was noted. There was no additional loss of motion which would support a higher rating.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee instability as of April 17, 2015

In knee claims, a claimant with both arthritis and instability of the knee may be rated separately under DCs 5003 and 5257 or 5258/5259. See VAOPGCPREC 23-97. For example, when a knee disorder was already rated under DC 5257 (addressing lateral instability), a separate rating may be warranted if the Veteran's knee also shows limitation of motion which at least meets the criteria for a zero-percent rating under DC 5260 (flexion limited to 60 degrees or less) or 5261 (extension limited to 5 degrees or more). Moreover, a separate rating could also be warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, based on X-ray findings of arthritis with painful motion. See VAOPGCPREC 9-98; see also Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1997). In addition, separate ratings may be granted based on limitation of flexion (DC 5260) and limitation of extension (DC 5261) of the same knee joint. VAOPGCPREC 09-04.

Thus, increased rating appeals for knee limitation of motion implicitly include instability. The Veteran might potentially be entitled to ratings for knee instability beginning April 17, 2015. However, the Board finds that separate ratings are not warranted for the periods on appeal.

A rating based on knee instability or cartilage symptoms requires:

"	Dislocation of the semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of locking, pain and effusion in the joint (20 percent under DC 5258);

"	Recurrent subluxation or lateral instability (under DC 5257; 10 percent for slight symptoms, 20 percent for moderate symptoms, and 30 percent for severe symptoms);

"	Symptoms due to the removal of the semilunar cartilage (10 percent under 5259); or,

"	Genu recurvatum (acquired, traumatic, with weakness and insecurity in weight bearing objectively demonstrated) (10 percent under 5263).

See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Under the pre-amended criteria, DC 5257 provides for instability that is "slight," "moderate," or "severe." 38 C.F.R. 4.71a, DC 5257 (2020).  These terms (slight, moderate, severe) are not defined in the pre-amended diagnostic code and, therefore, rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  

The use of the terminology within a VA examination report is not in and of itself dispositive. Id.  According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 999 (11th Ed. 2007), "slight" means small in amount.  "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect.  "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree. Effective February 7, 2021, DC 5257 is amended to provide for more explanation as to the terminology.  

Although not effective until February 7, 2021, the Board finds the definitions within the amended DC 5257 criteria instructive and, therefore, will apply either the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition or the amended DC 5257 definitions, whichever is most favorable for the Veteran in light of the evidence.

In this case, the Veteran's right knee instability does not reach the level of "severe."  

From April 17, 2015, the Veteran is in receipt of a 20 percent rating for moderate right knee instability. Given the absence of ankylosis, to receive a higher 30 percent rating, the Veteran must show severe symptoms. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257.

Here, the Board finds that a higher rating for this period is not warranted, as the symptoms are no more than moderate. The April 2016 C&P examiner diagnosed a right knee strain with instability. The examination report shows 0-5 mm anterior and medial instability in the right knee.  Next, the Veteran's November 2018 C&P examiner was unable to ascend the table to perform joint stability testing.  However, the evidence of record, to include a September 2023 C&P examination, do not seem to indicate right knee joint instability severe enough to warrant a rating in excess of 20 percent.  Indeed, that examination report shows recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  Specifically, he reports sudden giving out of the knee with prolonged standing or walking.  However, the symptoms above, taken as a whole, do not show that the symptoms are very painful, or harmful of a great degree.  Indeed, with recurrent subluxation or lateral instability of one knee, some sudden giving out with extended walking and standing is expected.  The fact that it occurs upon extended walking or standing indicates limit in scope.  As such, severe symptoms are not shown or indicated from April 17, 2015. Therefore, the medical and lay evidence after this examination does not show entitlement to instability ratings in excess of 20 percent from that date.

The Board also considered whether higher disability evaluations are warranted based on functional loss due to fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, pain on weight-bearing, flare-ups, and weakness. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; see Sharp v. Shinseki, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017); Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016); DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 206 -07 (1995). In this case, the Veteran has complained that he is limited in running, kneeling, and squatting due to pain. However, while the Veteran experiences the aforementioned symptoms, overall, it does not appear that these symptoms result in additional and significant functional loss, and his complaints are adequately contemplated in the ratings he currently receives. See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 37-43 (2011) (pain must affect some aspect of the normal working movements of the body such as strength, speed, coordination or endurance). Of note, the Veteran's April 2016, November 2018, and September 2023 VA examiners, did not find any evidence of additional loss of motion or functioning after repetitive testing, flare-ups, and/or weight bearing that would warrant a higher rating for his right knee.

In considering the appropriate disability ratings, the Board has also considered the Veteran's statements that his right knee disability is worse than the rating he currently receives. Specifically, the Veteran notes that his knee gives out and function is limited with extended standing, walking, and kneeling. In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).

Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. While the Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses, he is not competent to identify a specific level of disability of his right or left knee disability according to the appropriate diagnostic codes. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991).

On the other hand, such competent evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's right knee disability has been provided by the medical personnel who have examined him during the current appeal and who have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with the evaluations. The medical findings (as provided in the examination reports) directly address the criteria under which this disability is evaluated. Therefore, based on the evidence of record, the Board determines that the ratings awarded for this period are appropriate.

The Board also finds that consideration for an extraschedular evaluation, a component of a claim for an increased rating, is not warranted. Bagwell v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 337, 339 (1996). Although the Board may not assign an extraschedular rating in the first instance, it must specifically adjudicate whether to refer a case for extraschedular evaluation when the issue either is raised by the claimant or is reasonably raised by the evidence of record. Barringer v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 242 (2008).

In considering whether an extraschedular rating may be warranted, VA must first determine whether the available applicable schedular rating criteria are inadequate because they do not contemplate the Veteran's level of disability and symptomatology. If the rating criteria are inadequate, VA must then determine whether the Veteran exhibits an exceptional disability picture indicated by other related factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization. If such related factors are exhibited, then referral must be made to the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service for extraschedular consideration. See Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008).

In this case, the evidence does not indicate that Veteran's disability picture could not be adequately contemplated by the applicable schedular rating criteria discussed above. Specifically, the Board has reviewed all relevant symptoms related to the issues on appeal, and concludes that there are no symptoms that were not able to be addressed by the applicable diagnostic codes. See Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181 (1998). As such, the Veteran's symptoms are not which are so unusual that they are outside the schedular criteria.

Therefore, given that the applicable schedular rating criteria are more than adequate in this case, the Board need not consider whether the Veteran's disability picture includes exceptional factors, and referral for consideration of the assignment of a disability evaluation on an extraschedular basis is not warranted. See Thun, 22 Vet. App.at 111; see also Bagwell v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 337, 338-9 (1996); Floyd v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 88, 96 (1996); Shipwash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 218, 227 (1995).

Lastly, TDIU is not for application, as the evidence does not indicate, nor does the Veteran contend, that his service-connected disabilities cause unemployability.  

Based on the medical evidence of record, the Board finds that a 10 percent rating prior to November 27, 2018 and a 40 percent rating from that date based on limitation of motion accurately represents the Veteran's right knee disability. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the Veteran's own statements regarding the severity of his right knee disability, and accounts for its effect on his daily life. However, at no time does the medical or lay evidence indicate that the Veteran's right knee flexion is limited to 30 degrees or extension is limited to 15 degrees prior to November 27, 2018, even when factors such as pain, weakness, and fatiguability are considered. Therefore, a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee limitation of motion prior to November 27, 2018 is not warranted.  Further, a rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee instability during the period reviewed is not for application.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
