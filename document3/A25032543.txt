FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to February 9, 2024, the right upper extremity radiculopathy was manifested by moderate incomplete paralysis of the minor extremity; severe incomplete paralysis was not shown.

2. Since February 9, 2023, the right upper extremity radiculopathy has been manifested by moderate incomplete paralysis of the minor extremity; severe incomplete paralysis has not been shown.

3. The Veteran's anterior neck scar was not documented as painful or unstable, or as having visible or palpable tissue loss, or any of the other characteristics of disfigurement.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial 30 percent disability rating for right upper extremity radiculopathy for the period prior to February 9, 2024 are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8510.  

2. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for right upper extremity radiculopathy for the period from February 9, 2024 are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8510.  

3. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for the anterior neck scar are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1973 to September 1976.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  A February 2023 rating decision granted service connection for right upper extremity radiculopathy and an anterior neck scar and assigned 20 percent and noncompensable ratings respectively.  The Veteran submitted a request for Higher Level Review (HLR) in July 2023 that was resolved by the November 2023 rating decision on appeal.  Following the November 2023 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) and selected the Direct Review docket.  

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of February 1, 2023-the date of the rating decision adjudicated by the November 2023 HLR rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after February 1, 2023, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The Board notes that the RO increased the disability rating for right upper extremity radiculopathy to 30 percent in a December 2024 rating decision, effective February 9, 2024.  As this does not represent a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal, the claim remains before the Board.  

Increased Ratings 

Generally, disability ratings are determined by applying the rating criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and represent the average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10. 

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA compensation, as well as the whole recorded history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; see generally Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where there is a question of which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  Id.  Additionally, while it is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

Where the appellant has expressed dissatisfaction with the assignment of a rating, separate, or "staged," ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found.   Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Right Upper Extremity Radiculopathy

The Veteran has an initial 20 percent rating for right upper extremity radiculopathy, effective October 20, 2022 pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8510.  As noted, the rating is staged to 30 percent effective February 9, 2024.  Diagnostic Code 8510 provides a 20 percent rating for mild incomplete paralysis of the major and minor extremities.  See id.  A 40 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis of the major extremity and a 30 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis of the minor extremity.  See id.  Severe incomplete paralysis is rated 50 percent on the major side and 40 percent on the minor side, and complete paralysis is rated as 70 percent on the major side and 60 percent on the minor side.  See id.  

The terms "major" and "minor" as used in the rating criteria refer to the dominant or non-dominant upper extremity.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.69.  

The terms "mild," "moderate," and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all evidence, to the end that decisions will be equitable and just.  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, is not dispositive of an issue.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Absent an express definition, it is presumed that VA regulations employ words using their ordinary dictionary meanings at the time the regulations were promulgated. See Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 80506 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  However, VA's Adjudication Manual, M21-1, III.iv.4.N.4.c specifically defines the terminology in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DCs 8510-8730. The Manual defines "mild" as:

As this is the lowest level of evaluation for each nerve this is the default assigned based on the symptoms, however slight, as long as they were sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment for service connection purposes. In general, look for a disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area. A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.

The Manual indicates with regard to "moderate:"

Symptoms will likely be described by the claimants and medically graded as significantly disabling. In such cases a larger area in the nerve distribution may be affected by sensory symptoms. Other sign/symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate.

Finally, the Manual indicates with regard to "severe:"

In general, expect motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases. Even though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve. Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve.

Considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to an increased evaluation of 30 percent for moderate incomplete paralysis of the minor extremity prior to February 9, 2024.  The Board also concludes that an increased evaluation in excess of 40 percent is not warranted at any point during the claim period.  

Initially, the Board notes that the records are unclear as to whether the Veteran is right or left hand dominant.  In a December 2002 VA examination report he is listed as right-handed; however, a previous VA examination in April 2021 indicated that he is left-handed.  The VA treatment records are also inconsistent as to the dominant extremity.  The Board notes, however, that a March 2025 Board decision acknowledged these discrepancies and determined that the most probative evidence showed the Veteran was left hand dominant.  As part of that decision, the Board rated the service-connected left upper extremity radiculopathy disability under the criteria for major extremities.  Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by favorable findings by the RO or by a prior Board decision on an issue on appeal in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Board finds no indication of CUE in the March 2025 Board decision and will thus rate the right upper extremity as the minor extremity.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for the service-connected neck disability in December 2022.  The examiner noted bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy characterized by moderate pain and mild numbness.  The examiner noted that the Veteran experienced moderate constant pain and mild numbness.  The Veteran had full muscle strength, no atrophy, normal reflexes and some decreased sensation on the right upper extremity.  The Veteran was noted to be limited in pulling, carrying, and lifting moderate objects overhead.  VA treatment records document the Veteran's cervical radiculopathy.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was afforded an additional VA examination for neck conditions in November 2024.  However, as this examination is outside the evidentiary window for this appeal, the Board may not consider it.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the right upper extremity radiculopathy more nearly approximates moderate incomplete paralysis throughout the claim period.  The evidence shows that the Veteran experienced moderate constant pain, as well as sensory impairment, including numbness in his right upper extremity and decreased sensation in the forearm and hand of the right upper extremity.  As noted, Diagnostic Code 8510 provides that moderate symptoms of radiculopathy for the minor extremity warrants a 30 percent evaluation.  Thus, resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that entitlement to an increased evaluation of 30 percent prior to February 9, 2024 for right upper extremity radiculopathy is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8510.  

The Board also concludes that the record does not support that the right upper extremity radiculopathy manifested as severe incomplete paralysis or complete paralysis at any time during the claim period.  As noted, the symptoms were reported as moderate or mild by the VA examiner and, although the Veteran has some decreased sensation, his reflexes and muscle strength testing were normal.  Accordingly, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that the Veteran is entitled to an increased rating of 30 percent prior to February 9, 2024 and the claim is granted to that extent. The claim is otherwise denied.  To the extent the claim is denied, the Board concludes that the evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced.  Rather, it persuasively weighs against an increased disability rating.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine (38 U.S.C. § 5107(b)) is therefore not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  

Anterior Neck Scar

The Veteran has an initial noncompensable disability rating for the anterior neck scar pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800.  

Diagnostic Codes 7800 to 7805 pertain to scars.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Diagnostic Code 7800 applies to scars of the head, face or neck.  Under that code, a 10 percent rating is warranted for one characteristic of disfigurement.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or with two or three characteristics of disfigurement.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or with four or five characteristics of disfigurement.  An 80 percent rating, the highest rating available under Diagnostic Code 7800, is warranted for visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or with six or more characteristics of disfigurement.

Note (1) following Diagnostic Code 7800 identifies 8 characteristics of disfigurement, for the purposes of evaluation under § 4.118: (1) scar 5 or more inches (13 or more cm.) in length; (2) scar at least one-quarter inch (0.6 cm.) wide at widest part; (3) surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation; (4) scar adherent to underlying tissue; (5) skin hypo-or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); (6) skin texture abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); (7) underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); and (8) skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.).

As the scar is on the neck, Diagnostic Codes 7801 and 7802 do not apply in this case, and will not be discussed.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7801 and 7802.

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, a 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful.  Higher ratings of 20 and 30 percent are warranted if there are three or four, or five or more, unstable or painful scars, respectively.  If one or more scars are both unstable and painful, a 10 percent rating is added to the rating that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.  An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804, Note 1.

Under Diagnostic Code 7805, a scar may be rated on any disabling effect(s) not considered as part of Diagnostic Codes 7801 to 7804.  

As relevant here, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for the scar in December 2022.  The examiner noted the existence of a scar, status post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion C3-4, anterior neck.  The Veteran did not report current symptoms.  The examiner noted that the scar was not painful or unstable and not due to burns.  The scar was measured as 5.5 by 0.2 centimeters.  The examiner noted no elevation, depression, adherence to underlying tissue or missing underlying soft tissue.  The examiner also noted no abnormal pigmentation.  The examiner reported that the scar was not tender to palpation or unstable on inspection.  The examiner also noted no gross distortion or assymetry of facial features or visible or palpable tissue loss.  The examiner also reported that the scar did not result in any limitation of function.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a compensable disability rating for the neck scar.  The evidence of record does not reflect any visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features or any characteristics of disfigurement.  Nor is there evidence of pain, instability or functional limitation related to the scar.  Accordingly, the claim for an initial compensable disability rating for the neck scar is denied.  

The Board concludes that the evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced.  Rather, it persuasively weighs against an increased rating.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine (38 U.S.C. § 5107(b)) is therefore not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
