2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had any compensable symptoms of a lumbar spine disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. Bruxism is not disability for which service connection can be granted.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had any symptoms of a cervical spine disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had any symptoms related to a left knee scar at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had any symptoms of bilateral shin splints at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

7. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had any symptoms of a left wrist impairment at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 4, to April 12, 2016. 

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2023 decision.  In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

SERVICE CONNECTION

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

To establish the presence of a current disability, there must be competent evidence specific to the claimant tending to show that an impairment rises to a level to affect earning capacity, which may include showing manifestations of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person. Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 17 (2020). 

Every veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service. 38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b). Therefore, where there is evidence showing that a disorder manifested or was incurred in service, and this disorder is not noted on the veteran's entrance examination report, this presumption of soundness operates to shield the veteran from any finding that the unnoted disease or injury preexisted service. See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012); Bagby v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 225, 227 (1991); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).

Such presumption is only rebutted where the evidence clearly and unmistakably shows that the veteran's disability (1) existed before acceptance and enrollment into service and (2) was not aggravated by service. See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Bagby, 1 Vet. App. at 227; VAOPGCPREC 3-2003 (July 16, 2003). The two parts of this rebuttal standard are referred to as the "preexistence prong" and the "aggravation prong." Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 234 (2012). To satisfy this second-prong requirement for rebutting the presumption of soundness, the government must show by clear and unmistakable evidence either that there was no increase in disability during service or that any increase in disability was "due to the natural progression" of the condition. Joyce v. Nicholson, 443 F.3d 845, 847 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

The Board is bound by favorable findings of the AOJ under the AMA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus

The AOJ found that the Veteran had bilateral mild, asymptomatic pes planus on his enlistment examination dated November 15, 2015. 

A preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active-duty service where there is an increase in disability during the service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a). Clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence is required to rebut the presumption of aggravation where the pre-service disability underwent an increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b).

To trigger the presumption of aggravation, the Veteran must simply show, via evidence of record, that there was an increase in disability during his time in service. See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004). If the Veteran establishes such a showing, the burden then shifts to the government to show a lack of aggravation by establishing that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease. See Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support presence of disability even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has clarified that lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis or etiology when (1) a lay person is competent to identify a medical condition; (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

The credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, should be assessed to determine its probative value, and the evidence found to be persuasive or unpersuasive should be accounted for, and reasons should be provided for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. See Masors v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181 (1992). Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value.

A review of the lay and medical evidence of record following the Veteran's separation from service does not reveal any complaints, treatment, or lay statements describing symptoms that would support a finding that the Veteran has a current disability of pes planus. 

While the Board acknowledges that the Veteran had pes planus on his entrance examination, no further diagnosis, treatment, or complaints for pes planus is contained in the medical evidence of record. Therefore, a current disability cannot be established. 

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the award of service connection for bilateral pes planus, and the claim for service connection must be denied. As the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt does not apply. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability

The Veteran contends he began experiencing low back pain during 8-mile ruck marches during service. 

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of any lumbar spine disability reaching the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

In making this determination, the Board has considered Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), in which the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Id. at 1367-69. However, as discussed further below, the medical evidence of record does not reveal any complaints or symptoms associated with a lumbar spine disability. The only indication of any lumbar spine disability is a notation of a possible pars defect on an X-ray as part of an employment physical. 

A review of the Veteran's medical records reveals all normal musculoskeletal examinations with no complaints of back pain or other lumbar spine issues. 

While the Veteran believes there is a current diagnosis of a lumbar spine disability reaching the level of functional impairment of earning capacity, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education and the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

3. Entitlement to service connection for bruxism

The Veteran contends he has bruxism related to his active duty service. 

A Final Rule prohibiting bruxism as a stand-alone disability for VA compensation purposes became effective on September 10, 2017. See 82 Fed. Reg. 36080, 36081 (Aug. 3, 2017). The Final Rule noted that "VA has determined that only secondary service connection for treatment purposes is warranted for [bruxism], both because it is only a secondary condition, not a primary condition, and because its symptoms are already contemplated by the underlying condition." Id. The Veteran has not asserted that his bruxism is related to another service-connected disability. Therefore, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted for bruxism on a direct basis.

4. Entitlement to service connection for scar, left knee

The Veteran's entrance examination shows a history of knee surgery of the right knee. 

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records and post-service treatment records reveal no evidence of a left knee scar. The Veteran has not alleged any symptoms associated with a left knee scar. As there are no current symptoms or any indication of any left knee scar or disability, the Board finds there is no current disability, and the claim must be denied. Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 17 (2020).

5. Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability

6. Entitlement to service connection for left leg shin splints

7. Entitlement to service connection for right leg shin splints

8. Entitlement to service connection for left wrist impairment

The remaining issues on appeal will be considered together because they share a similar set of facts and circumstances. 

The Veteran submitted a claim for entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability, bilateral shin splints, and a left wrist impairment. A review of the Veteran's STRs and post-service treatment records has not revealed any report of symptoms, complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to any of these disabilities. The Veteran has not submitted any lay statements indicating that he has any symptoms related to any of these impairments. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have any current cervical spine, bilateral leg shin splint, or left wrist disabilities and has not had any during the pendency of the appeal. Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 17 (2020).

If the Veteran has medical treatment records or other evidence that could substantiate these claims, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition

to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.
