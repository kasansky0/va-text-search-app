ORDER

An initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right knee post-traumatic arthritis and patellofemoral chondromalacia, status-post partial knee replacement, meniscectomy, and arthroscopy (instability) is denied.  

As the reduction in the rating was invalid, a 30 percent rating for right knee post-traumatic arthritis and patellofemoral chondromalacia, status-post partial knee replacement, meniscectomy, and arthroscopy (limitation of flexion), from April 11, 2023, is restored, and the appeal is granted, subject to the law and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence shows the Veteran experiences mild laxity with anterior drawer motion of the right knee, indicating right knee instability, and does not require a brace or assistive device.  

2. The reduction in the disability rating for right knee post-traumatic arthritis and patellofemoral chondromalacia, status-post partial knee replacement, meniscectomy, and arthroscopy (limitation of flexion), from April 11, 2023, from 30 to 10 percent, was not based on an adequate examination and showing evidence of sustained material improvement under the ordinary conditions of life.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee post-traumatic arthritis and patellofemoral chondromalacia, status post partial knee replacement, meniscectomy, and arthroscopy (instability) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.321, 4.3, 4.7, 4.20, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5260, 5261.

2. The reduction in the disability rating for right knee post-traumatic arthritis and patellofemoral chondromalacia, status-post partial knee replacement, meniscectomy, and arthroscopy (limitation of flexion), from 30 percent to 10 percent from April 11, 2023 was invalid.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.344.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from May 1990 to May 1994 and April 2006 to February 2007.  

This case arrived before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2023 rating decision, in which the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) Regional Office (RO) continued a 10 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected right knee instability, and reduced a 30 percent rating to 10 percent for his service-connected right knee limitation of flexion effective April 11, 2023.  

By way of background pertaining to the right knee, in two separate January 2021 rating decisions, the RO had granted service connection for a right knee disability of "right knee joint condition," assigning a noncompensable evaluation effective December 8, 2019, and a few days later increased the evaluation to 10 percent and recharacterized the service-connected disability as "right knee strain status-post meniscectomy arthroscopy."

Over a year after the most recent decision, VA received private medical records in March 2022.  

In June 2022, a separate evaluation for right knee status-post partial knee replacement, meniscectomy arthroscopy, patellofemoral chondromalacia, shin splints, post-traumatic arthritis and instability was granted with an evaluation of 10 percent effective June 1, 2022.  At that time, the RO also assigned a temporary total evaluation based on surgical or other treatment necessitating convalescence due to evidence showing the Veteran underwent a partial knee replacement in December 2021, effective December 6, 2021 to June 1, 2022 (the first month follow convalesce period), and 30 percent thereafter.  

Within a year of that decision granting service connection for right knee instability, the Veteran filed a claim for benefits regarding his right knee evaluation in March 2023, which apparently led to the July 2023 decision on appeal, continuing the 10 percent evaluation for instability, and reducing a 30 percent evaluation for limitation of flexion.  

In a January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran appealed the July 2023 decision and elected the Board's Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Veterans Benefits Law

1. Rating Reduction

Where a reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The beneficiary will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor.  Additionally, the beneficiary must be given notice that he has 60 days to present additional evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at the present level, and (2) 30 days to request a predetermination hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), (i).  

If a timely request for a predetermination hearing is received, VA will notify the beneficiary in writing of the time and place of the hearing at least 10 days in advance of the scheduled hearing date.  The hearing will be conducted by VA personnel who did not participate in the proposed adverse action and who will bear the decision-making responsibility.  Also, if a predetermination hearing is timely requested, benefit payments shall be continued at the previously established level pending a final determination concerning the proposed action.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i)(1).  

If a predetermination hearing is conducted, the final action will be based on evidence and testimony adduced at the hearing as well as the other evidence of record, including any additional evidence obtained following the hearing pursuant to necessary development.  If a reduction is then found warranted, the effective date of such reduction shall be the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final action expires.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105.  

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a), (b) prescribe additional requirements for rating reductions but only apply to ratings that have continued for long periods at the same level (5 years or more).  They do not apply to disabilities which have not become stabilized and are likely to improve.  Reexaminations disclosing improvement, physical or mental, in these disabilities will warrant reduction in rating.  38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).  

In this case, the issue concerns whether the reduction in the disability rating for right knee limitation of flexion was valid.  The Board finds, for the following reasons, that the reduction in the disability rating was invalid and that, therefore, the 30 percent rating must be restored.  

In the June 2022 rating decision, the RO awarded a 100 percent temporary total evaluation (TTE) due to the Veteran's December 2021 partial knee replacement requiring convalescence through June 1, 2022, and a 30 percent thereafter based on limitation of flexion of 15 degrees or less with an addition symptom of resurfacing of the knee.  The Board notes that the reduction from 100 to 30 percent in the June 2022 rating decision was performed under law, the 100 percent having resulted form a TTE.  Cf. Love v. McDonough, 106 F.4th 1361, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2024) (when the law itself contemplates a rating will change as the Veteran's diagnosis evolves, a reduction is not a "traditional" rating reduction where the rating is reduced in grade based on a stepwise improvement of their still-existing disability).  

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim for entitlement to a total disability evaluation based upon individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) in part based on his right knee.  As an aside, the Board notes TDIU has been granted from November 11, 2022.  Regarding any time period that a reduction did not result in an overall reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments being made (i.e., the Veteran's combined disability rating remained at 100 percent at the time of the reduction), no further discussion as to the notice and due process requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) is necessary.  In this regard, while the Board finds favorably for the Veteran, the Board also notes that any grant herein, or reversal of the reduction for limitation of flexion, is subject to the rules governing monetary rewards.  

The Veteran was provided with a VA examination in April 2023.  He reported flare ups requiring ice, medication, and stretching, and a functional loss of not being able to run, go on long walks, or kneel.  The examiner did not provide an opinion on improvement.  

In the July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ reduced the disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected right knee limitation of flexion from 30 percent to 10 percent based on painful motion of the knee, noting that a higher evaluation would not be warranted unless the evidence shows limitation of flexion of 16 to 30 degrees.  

At the time of the reduction, the rating for right knee limitation of flexion had been in effect since June 1, 2022.  Thus, as the rating had been in effect for less than five years, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a), (b), which provide additional regulatory hurdles to rating reductions, do not apply.  

Nevertheless, the applicable regulations "impose a clear requirement that VA rating reductions, as with all VA rating decisions, be based upon review of the entire history of the Veteran's disability."  Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1993) (referring to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.13).  

With respect to ratings that have been in effect for less than 5 years, as in this case, 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c) requires improvement before a rating is reduced.  Implicit in the regulations is that any improvement must be of such a nature as to warrant a change in the rating.  In Brown, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) articulated three questions that must be addressed in determining whether a rating reduction is warranted by the evidence.  First, a rating reduction case requires ascertaining "whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability."  Second, it must be determined whether the examination reports reflecting such change were based upon thorough examinations.  Third, it must be determined whether the improvement actually reflects an improvement in a Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 421.  

In light of the above evidence, the Board finds that the reductions in the disability rating for the Veteran's right knee limitation of flexion was invalid.  Specifically, the AOJ did not at all address whether there was "an actual improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work."  Id.   

The circumstances under which a disability rating may be reduced are specifically limited and carefully circumscribed by regulations promulgated by VA.  See Dofflemeyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 280 (1992).  The Court has stated that both decisions by the AOJ and by the Board that do not apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344, when applicable, are void ab initio and will be set aside as not in accordance with the law.  Kitchens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 320 (1995).  Where a rating reduction was made without observance of law, the reduction must be vacated and the prior rating restored.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).  

The law is clear that certain procedures must be followed when a disability rating is reduced.  For the foregoing reasons, the failure to properly apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 renders the rating reduction void ab initio.  Kitchens, 7 Vet. App. at 320; Dofflemeyer, 2 Vet. App. at 277.  Accordingly, under these circumstances, the previously assigned 30 percent rating for right knee limitation of flexion is to be restored, effective April 11, 2023. 

2. Evaluation of Knee Instability

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate Diagnostic Codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).  If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  

Where the appeal arises from the original assignment of a disability evaluation following an award of service connection, the severity of the disability at issue is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time. Where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different evaluations during the course of the appeal, the assignment of staged ratings is appropriate.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  

Where an increase in the level of a disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  Where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different evaluations during the course of the appeal, the assignment of staged ratings is appropriate.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  

Additionally, the evaluation of the same disability under several Diagnostic Codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided.  Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the Veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).  

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.  

Separate ratings can be assigned for knee disabilities when none of the symptomatology overlaps and the separate rating is based on additional disabling symptomatology; this includes separate ratings based on limitation of flexion (Diagnostic Code 5260), limitation of extension (Diagnostic Code 5261), instability and recurrent subluxation (Diagnostic Code 5257), and meniscal conditions (Diagnostic Codes 5258, 5259).  See VAOPGCPREC 23-97, 62 Fed. Reg. 63,603 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 9-98, 63 Fed. Reg. 56, 703 (1998); VAOPGCPREC 9-2004; 69 Fed. Reg. 59,988 (2004); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017).  

The normal range of motion of the knee is from 0 degrees extension to 140 degrees flexion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.  Limitation of flexion warrants 10, 20, and 30 percent ratings when limitation is to 45 degrees, 30 degrees, and 15 degrees, respectively.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.  Limitation of extension warrants 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 percent ratings when limitation is to 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees, respectively.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.  A 10 percent rating can also be assigned for the knee joint if there is painful motion without compensable limitation of motion. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003; see also Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011) (holding that the applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to arthritis claims).  

Ratings can be assigned when a knee disability affects the meniscus, with a 20 percent rating for dislocated semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint and a 10 percent rating for removal of semilunar cartilage (e.g., meniscectomy) and current residual symptoms.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5258, 5259.   

Ratings can be assigned for impairment of the tibia or fibula, genu recurvatum, or ankylosis of the knee.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5256, 5262, 5263. Ankylosis is stiffening or fixation of a joint as the result of a disease process, with fibrous or bony union across the joint.  Dinsay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 79, 81 (1996). Ankylosis is also defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure."  DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 93 (30th ed. 2003).  In this case the evidence does not reflect, and the Veteran does not allege, that he has genu recurvatum or ankylosis of the knee.  As for tibia or fibula impairment, on VA examination in October 2021, the examiner indicated the Veteran had medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), or shin splints for the right and left knee; however, they would have resulted in noncompensable ratings because they showed treatment for less than 12 consecutive months.  

In this case, the Veteran has separate ratings for right lower extremity shin splints, right knee limitation of flexion, and right knee instability, as well as meniscal scarring.  

In his appeal, the Veteran has sought a higher rating pertaining to instability.  From June 1, 2022, the Veteran's right knee post-traumatic arthritis and patellofemoral chondromalacia, status-post knee replacement, meniscectomy, and arthroscopy (instability) has been rated at 10 percent.  

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for disabilities of the knee and leg.  The amended Diagnostic Code 5257 provides ratings for other impairment of the knee based on recurrent subluxation or instability, and patellar instability.  

For recurrent subluxation or instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted for sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for one of the following: (a) Sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation; or (b) Unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation.  

For patellar instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: A brace, cane, or walker. A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker.  

Note (1) provides that, for patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon.  Note (2) provides that a surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as a surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration).  

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee instability.  The Board has considered the Veteran's reports about the severity of his right knee disability, including instability.  See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347, 352-53 (2018).  However, overall, the lay and medical evidence the Board is able to consider from before the July 13, 2023 rating decision indicates that while he has right knee instability, no medical provider has prescribed a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation.  

While the Board has considered the Veteran's argument, such as a hand-written statement sent to VA in November 2024, the Board cannot consider the content in the argument as evidence applicable to the rating period on review in this case as the direct docket selection on the Veteran's January 2024 VA Form 10182 prevents evidence submission for the present appeal beyond the July 2023 rating decision.  To this end, the argument can only pertain to evidence available for review prior to July 13, 2023.  

In this regard, there is no evidence he has been prescribed assistive devices for ambulation or a brace.  A VA examiner submitted an addendum to an April 2023 VA examination the following month, in May 2023, noting that there is recurrent subluxation or persistent instability, and clarified that the Veteran has mild laxity with anterior drawer motion of the right knee.  At the April 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported not being able to take long walks or run, but there were no devices used and the VA examiner indicated none had been prescribed.  

Medical treatment records during the period on review also do not support an increase in the rating for instability.  

Given the above, a higher or separate rating is not warranted based on right knee instability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.  

Regarding other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the knee and leg, other disability ratings not already assigned would be duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other knee disabilities.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).  

For the above reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for ratings in excess of 10 percent for right knee instability.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an increased rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).  

As a final note, the Board has considered the Veteran's claims on appeal and decided entitlement based on the evidence.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with respect to his claims.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
