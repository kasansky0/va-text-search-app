ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to fine particulate matter and has a present disability of chronic sinusitis that manifested after separation from a period of qualifying service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis are met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.317, 3.320.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from May 1992 to August 1992 and November 2002 to September 2003.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal of a January 2024 decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. The Veteran appealed by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in September 2024. He elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, consideration may only be given to the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted after, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Delaying a decision to permit additional time to submit evidence under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) is not needed. The claim is granted for the reasons below, and thus this appeal is distinguishable from Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Service Connection - Laws and Regulations  

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of inservice incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

Effective August 5, 2021, service connection may also be warranted on a presumptive basis for asthma, rhinitis, sinusitis, and rhinosinusitis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(2). To do so, such disorder must become manifest to any degree (including noncompensable) within 10 years from the date of separation from military service in: (i) The Southwest Asia theater of operations, as defined in § 3.317(e)(2), during the Persian Gulf War as defined in § 3.2(i); or (ii) Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti, or Uzbekistan on or after September 19, 2001 during the Persian Gulf War as defined in § 3.2(i). 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(1), (a)(4). Such Veterans are presumed to have been exposed to fine, particulate matter during such service, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to fine, particulate matter during that service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(3). However, such diseases shall not be presumed service connected if there is affirmative evidence that: (1) the disease was not incurred during or aggravated by a qualifying period of service; (2) the disease was caused by a supervening condition or event that occurred between the Veteran's most recent departure from a qualifying period of service and the onset of the disease; or (3) the disease is the result of the Veteran's own willful misconduct. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(b).

As a result of the PACT Act of 2022, the requirement that the disability must manifest within 10 years from the date of separation was removed from the regulation effective August 10, 2022. 

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against a claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

Entitlement to Service Connection for Chronic Sinusitis

The Veteran maintains that sinusitis is related to service.

The Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to fine particulate matter during his active duty in Iraq and Kuwait in 2002 and 2003, i.e., "qualifying service." See August 2023 VA Memorandum; January 2024 Rating Decision; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 3.320(a)(4). 

The evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether he also has a current diagnosis of sinusitis that manifested after separation from that qualifying service.  See October 2023 VA Examination (acute sinusitis); November 2023 VA Primary Care Physician Note ("chronic sinusitis") following review of x-rays.

As a result, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection for sinusitis is warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(2).  The appeal is granted.
