ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right hand disorder is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's right hand disability is due to his service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right hand disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310(a), 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2016 to July 2023. He is the recipient of various awards, to include the Combat Action Badge.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in July 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In August 2024, the Veteran timely appealed such decision to the Board by filing a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in such decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a right hand disorder. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See, e.g., Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In addition, for Veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including arthritis, are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. § 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307, 3.309.

That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease. If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

As an initial matter, the Board acknowledges that the AOJ initially denied this claim based on a lack of current diagnosis. However, the Board also finds that the record clearly demonstrates a diagnosis of right hand chronic pain, treated by rheumatology with a preliminary diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. While there has been some discussion within the medical treatment records of the exact nature of the Veteran's right hand pain, to include whether such might be more accurately diagnosed a right-hand trigger finger due to locking of the joint, the Board finds evidence of a clear disability and will not focus on the medical nuance therein. 

Further, the Board finds ample evidence of onset of this disorder during the Veteran's military service. Specifically, the Veteran began reporting right hand pain following his return from deployment in 2023. Medical records from February 2023-five months prior to separation from service-document several months of ongoing pain in the right hand, with flare-ups. Further, the Veteran reported right hand stiffness on his separation physical. Thereafter, medical records show treatment for ongoing chronic right hand pain. 

The Board acknowledges the negative nexus statement provided by a VA medical provider in April 2024. However, such was based on a finding that the Veteran does not have any currently diagnosed right hand disorder, which is inconsistent with the medical evidence of record, as already discussed. Further, the same examiner acknowledged the Veteran's reports of pain impacting his right hand function in a corresponding examination report.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110"refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability").

Therefore, after resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the evidence is in favor of finding that service connection for a right hand disorder, preliminarily diagnosed as arthritis, is warranted based on a finding of continuity of symptomatology since service.
