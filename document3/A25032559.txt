DOCKET NO. 240906-472475
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for sinusitis is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On October 29, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

In the present case, the Veteran submitted a statemen October 2024 statement in support of claim indicating he wished to withdraw his appeal for entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for sinusitis.  Therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
