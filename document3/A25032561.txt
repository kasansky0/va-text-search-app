REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right hip, stress fracture of neck of femur (claimed as joint pains (hip)) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2009 to June 2012.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), also known as the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of right hip, stress fracture of neck of femur (claimed as joint pains (hip)), any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to an initial increased rating for right hip, stress fracture of neck of femur (claimed as joint pains (hip)) is remanded. 

The issue of entitlement to an initial increased rating for right hip, stress fracture of neck of femur (claimed as joint pains (hip)) is remanded to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Veteran contends that she fractured her hip while in the field and that she disagrees with the 0 percent evaluation that was assigned with an effective date of January 31, 2023. See March 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; February 2024 VA Form 20-0996; and June 2024 Rating Decision. 

Initially, the Board notes that two VA examinations were requested for the Veteran's hip condition - one on May 19, 2023; however, the initial examination request did not contain a date. The record shows that the examinations were cancelled on May 9, 2023, and June 3, 2023, because the Veteran not being available. However, the exam scheduling request specifically stated that the Veteran did not need to report for all examinations for the contention of joint pains (hip). See April 2023; May 2023; and June 2023 Exam Requests. 

Additionally, the claims file contains no copies of an examination notice or other documentation that the Veteran had been notified of the date, time, and place of her scheduled examinations, or of the mechanism by which they attempted to contact the Veteran.

Although it appears that the Veteran failed to attend her scheduled VA examinations, the Board finds that the record lacks evidence that she was provided proper notice of the scheduled examinations. Furthermore, the exam request instructions stated that Veteran did not need to attend the VA examination; therefore, the Veteran remains entitled to a VA medical examination and opinion addressing her claim. 

The Board further notes that the record is devoid of the requested medical opinion as to whether the Veteran has a diagnosis of joint pains (hip) that is at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by (the) joint pains (hip) during service and if so, the severity of such disability. Such medical opinion still should have been obtained as the exam scheduling request specifically noted that the Veteran did not have to appear for the examination and cited additional information that should have been considered. See April 2023 and May 2023 Exam Requests. 

In remanding this claim, the Veteran is notified that the duty to assist is not a one-way street; a claimant is obligated to cooperate in the development of a pending claim. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). In short, failure to appear for examinations, as scheduled and with proper notice, may result in the denial of the issue on appeal. See 38 CFR § 3.158; Jernigan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 220 (2012).

Accordingly, the Board finds that this claim must be remanded for a VA examination and opinion addressing the current severity of the Veteran's service-connected hip disability.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of her service-connected hip disability. The VA examiner must review the complete claims file and must note that review in the report. All necessary tests and studies should be accomplished, and all clinical findings reported in detail.

2. Send notification to the Veteran, at her last reported home address detailing the date, time, and location of the scheduled examination. Request acknowledgement and give a reasonable amount of time to respond, cancel, or request rescheduling. 

3. Conduct the examination if possible or update the file with evidence that the Veteran was notified at her last known addresses of the date, time, and location of the examination.

4. Thereafter, readjudicate the claim on appeal.
