FINDING OF FACT

In January 2025, the Board received a written statement that the Veteran wishes to withdraw the appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board issues a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  The withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id. 

Appeal withdrawals must be in writing, must include the name of the claimant, the applicable claim number, and a statement that the appeal is being withdrawn, and must be received by the Board prior to issuance of a decision on the claim or claims being withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b).

Here, prior to issuing a decision in this matter, the Board received a January 2025 written statement (VA Form 21-4138) from the Veteran requesting to withdraw the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) he filed with respect to a September 2024 decision of the agency of original jurisdiction concerning entitlement to a higher rating for his left armpit scar, status post inclusion cyst excision.  He added that he no longer wished to pursue the appeal.  The statement includes his name and claim number.  Accordingly, the criteria for withdrawal of the appeal are satisfied.  See id. 

As there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law respecting the issue on appeal, which has been withdrawn, the appeal is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105
