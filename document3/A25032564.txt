DOCKET NO. 240814-465311
DATE: April 8, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of September 8, 2021 for the award of service connection for major depressive disorder and unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability was continuously pursued since his September 8, 2021 claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of September 8, 2021 for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder and unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156(a), 3.400, 3.2501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from August 1988 to August 1992.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). In July 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2024 decision. In August 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2024 decision. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 decision, which was subject to higher level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the June 2024 AOJ decision cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Although the one-year period to change Board dockets after issuance of the August 2024 decision has not expired, the Board is fully granting the Veteran's claim, so there is no prejudice to the Veteran in the Board's adjudication of the appeal at this time. 

Entitlement to an effective date of September 8, 2021 for the award of service connection for major depressive disorder and unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder is granted.

The Veteran and his attorney specifically assert that the proper effective date for the award of service connection for the Veteran's psychiatric disability is September 8, 2021. 

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Where a previously denied claim is granted after the submission of new and relevant evidence, the effective date is the later of the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156(a), 3.400, 3.2501.   

A claimant may indicate an intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). If within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a) appropriate to the benefit sought, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). Id. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. Id. The Board also has discretion to find an otherwise untimely appropriate review option was timely when a claimant shows good cause for the delay. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 20.203(c). 

After any reasonable doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor, the appropriate date of claim is September 8, 2021, and the claim has been continuously pursued since then.

Procedurally, a January 2019 Board decision denied service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. The Veteran did not appeal that decision or file for reconsideration, so the January 2019 Board decision became final. Next, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability on September 8, 2021. On September 10, 2021, the AOJ informed the Veteran that because that claim had been previously denied, he needed to file the claim on the proper form. Although the Veteran did not return the proper form, in March 2022 correspondence, VA informed the Veteran that there had been a delay in receipt of correspondence from VA from July 2021 through December 2021 and inclusive of the timeframe that the AOJ informed the Veteran that he needed to refile his claim on the proper form. Regardless, the October 2021 rating decision that denied service connection for the claimed psychiatric disability cited September 8, 2021 as the date of claim. As such, VA held out that claim as being properly filed. September 8, 2021 is therefore the date of claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability that was addressed in the October 2021 rating decision.

In January 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, seeking to reopen the previously denied claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability. Although received more than a year after the October 2021 rating decision, the Veteran also requested an extension to file the supplemental claim due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, the Board observes that the Presidential COVID-19 Emergency Declaration was in effect from March 2020 through April 2023, and inclusive of the period from October 2021 through January 2023. 

The January 2023 claim was then denied in a March 2023 rating decision. Within a year of that decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 HLR, continuing to seek service connection for a psychiatric disability, which eventually led to the June 2024 rating decision that granted service connection for the psychiatric disability effective from January 30, 2023. The Veteran then filed a timely HLR to the June 2024 rating decision, seeking an earlier effective date. That led to the August 2024 rating decision on appeal. 

Although the January 2023 Supplemental Claim was not otherwise timely, the Board finds the Veteran has shown good cause for his failure to timely appeal the October 2021 rating decision. In addition to the delay in receipt of mail recognized by VA, the 1-year appeal period for the October 2021 rating decision coincides with the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. Resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, good cause has been shown for the delay in filing the January 2023 supplemental claim. As a result, the claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability was pending from September 8, 2021 until it was granted, and the Veteran has since continuously pursued the claim for an earlier effective date. In sum, September 8, 2021 is the proper date of claim in this appeal.

Although the evidence indicates that entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability arose prior to September 8, 2021; the date of claim is later in time and therefore the proper effective date. Moreover, September 8, 2021 is the effective date specifically requested by the Veteran. 

Thus, the claim for an effective date of September 8, 2021 for the award of service-connection for a psychiatric disability is fully granted.
