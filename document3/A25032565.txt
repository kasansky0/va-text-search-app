ORDER

Entitlement to an initial evaluation of 60 percent for chronic kidney disease is granted.

Entitlement to an initial evaluation of 100 percent for chronic kidney disease, effective May 27, 2021, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1. Prior to May 27, 2021, the medical evidence shows the Veteran's chronic kidney disease manifested in a definite decrease in kidney function.

2. As of May 27, 2021, the medical evidence shows markedly decreased kidney function, which required regular dialysis. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial rating of 60 percent, but no higher, for chronic renal disease, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.7, 4.115a, Diagnostic Code 7530.

2. For the period beginning May 27, 2021, the criteria for an initial rating of 100 percent for chronic renal disease, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.7, 4.115a, Diagnostic Code 7530.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1954 to August 1958. He died in March 2023 and the Appellant is his surviving spouse, who has been accepted as the substitute claimant.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested review of a February 2022 decision. In March 2022, the AOJ issued a decision finding a duty to assist error regarding the Veteran's claim for chronic kidney disease, and further development was directed. 

In July 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision continuing a noncompensable evaluation for the Veteran's chronic kidney disease. In July 2023, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested review of a July 2022 decision. In August 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2022 decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601, 20.301. No evidence was submitted during the period after the July 2022 decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

In evaluating the severity of a disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. This practice is known as "staged" ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided; however, separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of the symptomatology of the other condition. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).

The Veteran was assigned a noncompensable evaluation for chronic kidney disease pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7530, when service connection was granted effective September 2020. The Veteran was also in receipt of a 10 percent evaluation for hypertension, rated under Diagnostic Code 7101.

During the pendency of the appeal, the criteria for rating dysfunction of the genitourinary system, which includes Diagnostic Code 7530, were amended effective November 14, 2021. Because the rating criteria changed during the pendency of the appeal, the Board will consider the rating criteria that existed prior to November 14, 2021, and that which existed after, applying whichever is more favorable to the claimant. However, the Board may not retroactively apply the amended rating criteria for the portion of the period on appeal prior to November 14, 2021.

Prior to November 14, 2021, a noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7530 is warranted when there is albumin and casts with history of acute nephritis; or, hypertension non-compensable under Diagnostic Code 7101. Renal dysfunction is rated at 30 percent for albumin constant or recurring with hyaline and granular casts or red blood cells; or, transient or slight edema or hypertension at least 10 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 7101. A 60 percent rating is warranted for constant albuminuria with some edema; or, definite decrease in kidney function; or, hypertension at least 40 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 7101. An 80 percent rating is warranted for persistent edema and albuminuria with BUN 40 to 80mg%; or, creatinine 4 to 8mg%; or, generalized poor health characterized by lethargy, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, or limitation of exertion. A 100 percent rating is warranted where regular dialysis is required, or more than sedentary activity is precluded from one of the following: persistent edema and albuminuria; or, BUN more than 80mg%; or, creatinine more than 8mg%; or, markedly decreased function of kidney or other organ systems, especially cardiovascular. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, Diagnostic Code 7530.

After November 14, 2021, renal dysfunction remained rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a. However, the criteria for evaluation changed. Renal dysfunction uses the following evaluation: A noncompensable rating is warranted with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) 30 mg/g for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. A 30 percent rating is warranted with GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and structural kidney abnormalities (cystic, obstructive, or glomerular) for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and either recurrent red blood cell (RBC) casts, white blood cell (WBC) casts, or granular casts for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or chronic kidney disease with GFR from 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. A 60 percent rating is warranted where chronic kidney disease with GFR from 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. An 80 percent rating requires chronic kidney disease with GFR from 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. A maximum 100 percent evaluation is assigned for chronic kidney disease with GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or requiring regular routine dialysis; or eligible kidney transplant recipient.

The Board notes the duty to assist error identified in the March 2022 decision was the failure to provide the Veteran with a VA examination to determine the severity of his condition. A VA examination was scheduled for March 2022, however the Veteran failed to appear. A July 2022 VA report of general information noted the Veteran was contacted and he declined rescheduling his examination, instead requesting a decision based on the medical evidence. As was noted by the AOJ in August 2023, when a Veteran fails to report for a necessary examination in connection with an original claim, the claim must be decided on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).  The appeal for compensable evaluation of kidney disease stems from the first claim of service connection for the disability; following a grant of service connection by the Board in February 2022, and implementation of such by the AOJ that same month, the Veteran appealed the initial evaluation. It is part of an original claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

A review of the medical evidence, including VA treatment records and private treatment records, show the Veteran had a definite decrease in kidney function. VA treatment records include lab chemistry reports noting that between July 2015 and June 2019, the Veteran's albumin level ranged between 3.60 to 4.25, eGFR ranged between 27 to 37, BUN ranged between 27.1 to 39.8. An April 2021 VA treatment record indicates the Veteran's GFR was 25 and creatinine was 2.45. In May 2021, the lab tests indicated a BUN level of 27.9, creatinine of 1.97, eGFR of 32.5. A private treatment record from May 2021 showed a GFR of 19. Lab results from June 2022 showed a GFR of 24. In a December 2020 private treatment record, the Veteran was referred to nephrology related to renal insufficiency. 

A private treatment record from May 27, 2021, where the Veteran was hospitalized for two days, shows a diagnosis of stage 4 chronic kidney disease, along with acute systolic congestive heart failure. Following the May 2021 hospitalization, both VA and private treatment records indicate that the Veteran began regular dialysis treatment, three times per week, in June 2021, along with daily medications. After May 2021, VA treatment records show the Veteran's active problems list included stage 4 chronic kidney disease. A January 2022 VA treatment record included a notation of endstage renal disease, referencing the 2021 hospitalization, with a community provider, for hypoxemic respiratory failure, and noteworthy progressive decline of renal function. 

Prior to May 27, 2021

The Board has carefully reviewed the medical evidence of record for the period on appeal prior to May 27, 2021. The pre-amendment rating criteria for chronic kidney disease applies for this period. The Board notes that the Veteran was rated at 10 percent disabling for hypertension under Diagnostic Code 7101, which would warrant at least a 30 percent rating. Moreover, the Veteran's renal lab results consistently show the Veteran was out of normal range for kidney function. The Board interprets the renal laboratory results in the light most favorable to the Veteran and finds that a definite decrease in kidney function was shown during the period on appeal, prior to May 27, 2021. Due to the finding of a definite decrease in kidney function, the Veteran's chronic kidney disease more nearly approximates a 60 percent rating. 

The medical evidence, however, does not include notations or indications of renal dysfunction with persistent edema and albuminuria with BUN level of 40 to 80 mg%, a creatinine level of 4 to 8 mg%, or generalized poor health characterized by lethargy, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, or limitation of exertion, which would warrant an 80 percent rating. Nor is there evidence of markedly decreased function of kidney or other organ systems which would warrant a 100 percent rating.

Accordingly, for the period prior to May 27, 2021, the Veteran's service-connected chronic kidney disease warrants an initial rating of 60 percent, but no higher. 

As of May 27, 2021

After a careful review of the record as of May 27, 2021, the medical evidence shows that the Veteran required regular dialysis, three times weekly. The treatment records after May 27, 2021 include notations of stage 4 kidney disease and "endstage" renal disease, along with frequent and regular dialysis indicates a markedly decreased function of kidney, which would warrant a 100 percent rating under the pre-amendment criteria. Moreover, under the post-amendment criteria, the condition would warrant a 100 percent rating due to requiring regular routine dialysis. 

Accordingly, effective May 27, 2021, the Veteran's chronic kidney disease warrants a rating of 100 percent.
