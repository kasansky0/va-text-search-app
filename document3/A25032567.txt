DOCKET NO. 241015-487209
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the proposal to change the effective date assigned for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The October 2024 rating decision proposed to change the effective date for PTSD to June 30, 2020.

2. No final decision was issued to change the effective date for PTSD to June 30, 2020, at the time the Veteran submitted his October 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), to the Board. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the proposal to change the effective date assigned for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.203, § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from April 2001 to April 2004. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2024. Since this constitutes an initial decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), issued after the effective date of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the modernized review system applies. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

The Veteran appealed this decision by submitting a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD). In doing so, the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

In the October 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ proposed to change the effective date assigned to the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. Thereafter, the Veteran submitted an NOD with an intent to appeal the AOJ's proposal to change. The Board finds that the Veteran's NOD as to the proposal to change the effective date was premature as this was a proposed rating action and not a final decision on the claim.

The Board highlights 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.203 and 3.2500, Place and time of filing of Notice of Disagreement and Review of Decisions, respectively, to guide the claims processing rule at issue. The Board points out, as explained in these provisions, a veteran may appeal a claim within one year from the date that the AOJ issues a notice of a decision (emphasis added). Id. Thus, a proposal to change an effective date is not an appealable issue because it is not an actual decision but is, instead, a proposed action. Indeed, there are due process rights associated with the proposal, which in this case were provided to the Veteran, along with the October 2024 rating decision, explaining that further action was required prior to the matter becoming ripe for appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.200.

Therefore, because the Veteran's October 2024 NOD was premature as to this claim (before the disability rating was actually reduced), the present appeal must be dismissed due to the Veteran's failure to follow statutorily required appeals processing procedures. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.203; 3.2500.

Notwithstanding the above, the Board notes, however, that the proposal to reduce was promulgated in a February 2025 rating decision. Thus, if the Veteran chooses to appeal, he is advised that he has one year from the date that the AOJ issued a notice of the decision.
