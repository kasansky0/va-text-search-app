ORDER

The Veteran's appeal of the claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement as to the 2013 rating decision for service connection for PTSD was not timely filed in accordance with applicable processing rules.

2. The Veteran has not shown good cause warranting the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182 as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, denied in a January 2013 rating decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The AMA appeal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400; 20.104; 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran has active service from March 1982 to October 1988.  

The Veteran attempted to appeal the January 2013 rating decision by submitting a VA Form 10182 in August 2024 (01/30/2013 Rating Decision - Narrative; 08/07/2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement). 

In his VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran identified a 2013 PTSD decision as the decision on appeal. The only decision of record meeting that description is the January 30, 2013 rating decision, with notices sent that same day (01/30/2013	Rating Decision - Narrative; 01/30/2013 Notification Letter).

The August 2024 VA Form 10182 was submitted more than one year after the January 2013 denial. This renders the appeal untimely under both the legacy appeal system and the AMA framework.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.203.  

The Veteran was notified that the VA Form 10182 was untimely. This notice included information regarding showing cause for a late submission of a notice of disagreement (08/19/2024 BVA Untimely Appeal Letter).

The Veteran has not shown good cause to permit the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182 as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, denied in the January 2013 rating decision

As proper claims processing rules have not been followed and good cause for delayed submission of an appeal has not been shown, the appeal for entitlement to service connection for PTSD, assigned to the AMA direct review docket, is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 20.104.
