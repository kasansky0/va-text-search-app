DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an initial 30 percent disability rating, but no higher, for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's GERD has been manifested by persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal pain with considerable impairment of health, but without pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia nor symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

For the entire appeal period, the criteria for a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for GERD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Codes (DC) 7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Initial Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule For Rating Disabilities, which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. 

If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation; otherwise, the lower evaluation will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In view of the number of atypical instances it is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified.  Findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom, and above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will, however, be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21. 

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition.  The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 593 (1991).  The medical as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Prior to May 19, 2024, disabilities involving the digestive system are evaluated under the regulatory criteria found at 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.110-4.114.  The Veteran's GERD is rated 10 percent disabling, effective July 29, 2021, under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.  The effective date corresponds to the date of receipt of the claim of service connection for GERD.

Under DC 7346 (hernia hiatal), a 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  A 30 percent evaluation is assigned when there is evidence of persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.  A 10 percent evaluation is assigned when there is evidence of two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.

From May 19, 2024, GERD is evaluated under the new DC 7206. Pursuant to the new DC 7206 for GERD, a noncompensable evaluation is assigned for documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications. A 10 percent rating is assigned for documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic. A 30 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement. A 50 percent rating is assigned for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year. A maximum 80 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube). 38 C.F.R. § 4.114.

As noted earlier, the rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2023 and the Board may not consider evidence beyond that date.  However, evidence prior to the July 2023 rating decision may be found to entitle the Veteran to an increased rating effective from the May 2024 revisions, and thus such revised criteria are for consideration here.

Turning to the evidence of record, an August 2021 VA treatment record reflects a diagnosis of GERD.  The Veteran complained of almost daily episodes of heartburn.  She has been prescribed Prilosec 20 milligrams.  She was advised to lose weight and to avoid alcohol, caffeine, spicy, fried or acidic foods.  08/04/2021 CAPRI at 10.

An August 2021 C&P examination reflects a diagnosis of GERD.  The Veteran reports that her GERD has gotten worse since onset, and she has to watch what she eats.  She suffers from a constant lump in her throat and was put on Omeprazole and has not had any further treatment.  She suffers from constant chest pain and tightness with a lot of nausea and she feels as if food is stuck in her throat.  She takes Omeprazole 20 milligrams.  Her signs and symptoms included persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, reflux, substernal pain, sleep disturbance caused by esophageal reflux 4 or more times per year lasting 10 days or more, and nausea 4 or more times per year lasting 10 days or more.  

An April 2022 VA treatment record reflects the Veteran's report of GERD symptoms.  She reported having increased symptoms over the past year, especially at night, due to reflux.  She experienced epigastric pain and reflux of sour contents. She slept with her head raised.  She had the sensation of food and liquid getting stuck in her substernal area.  She stated it is mostly food, such as a chicken sandwich.  The examiner diagnosed refractory GERD with symptoms of esophageal dysphagia to solids and liquids.  She had frequent nocturnal symptoms. Her symptoms were worsening despite treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI).  10/04/2022 CAPRI at 100-104.

A May 2022 VA treatment record reflects the Veteran's report of worsening GERD despite PPI adherence.  She did not experience dysphagia or odynophagia.  Id. at 84.

As detailed above, the Veteran takes Omeprazole to control her symptoms, although as detailed April and May 2022 treatment records reflect that her symptoms were worsening despite treating with PPI.  Per the August 2021 examination, her GERD was manifested by persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, reflux, substernal pain, sleep disturbance, and nausea.  She reported during the course of August 2021 VA treatment that she experienced daily heartburn.  In contemplation of the diagnostic criteria for a 30 percent disability, the Board notes that there have been specific findings of persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, and substernal pain.  The August 2021 examiner did not check the box for regurgitation, but she has reported reflux and a feeling of a lump in her throat that feels like food is stuck.

In light of the subjective complaints and objective findings of persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, reflux, substernal pain, sleep disturbance, heartburn, nausea, and symptoms consistent with regurgitation, and in light of the finding that her GERD had worsened despite PPI adherence, the Board finds that the Veteran's GERD is productive of considerable impairment of health.  Thus, the Board finds that a 30 percent disability rating is warranted for GERD for the entire appeal period.  A 60 percent disability rating is not warranted as there is no indication that her GERD is manifested by pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, nor other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  Moreover, there is no showing of esophageal stricture such as to enable a higher rating under the revised criteria of Diagnostic Code 7206 effective May 19, 2024.  There is otherwise no other diagnostic code that could provide for a higher disability rating while still addressing the constellation of symptoms at issue in this case.
