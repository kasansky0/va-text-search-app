ORDER

An overpayment of monthly housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33 of Title 38 of the United States Code, (Chapter 33 or Post-9/11 GI Bill), in the total amount of $7,030.20, was properly created and is valid.  To that extent, the appeal is DENIED.   

Entitlement to a waiver of recovery of overpayment of monthly housing allowance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, in the total calculated amount of $7,030.20, is GRANTED.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. An overpayment of Chapter 33 monthly housing allowance benefits stemming from the school enrollment running from June 29, 2022 through August 20, 2022, in the total calculated amount of $7,030.20, was properly created and is valid.  

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, recovery of this overpayment would be against equity and good conscience since it was not the Veteran's fault and collection of the debt would defeat the purpose for which the VA benefit was intended.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The debt created by the overpayment of Chapter 33 monthly housing allowance benefits in the amount of $7,030.20, was properly created and is valid. 38 U.S.C. § 3313; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.9505, 21.9635, 21.9695.

2. The requirements for waiver of recovery of the overpayment in the amount of $7,030.20, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5302; 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.962, 1.963. 1.965.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1994 to October 2003, and from November 2003 to June 2005.  The Veteran also served on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 2009 to June 2016.  The Veteran had additional service with the United States Navy and Air Force Reserves.  

The case is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2023  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) decision, and a March 2023 Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC) decision.  The February 2023 decision notified the Veteran of the reasons and bases for the overpayment of monthly housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33, whereas the March 2023 COWC decision denied a request for a waiver of indebtedness for the overpayment in question.   

In the May 2023 Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA Form 10182), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February and March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision or decisions on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision.     

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

Whether an overpayment of monthly housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33, in the amount of $7,030.20, was properly created 

The Veteran's entitlement to Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance benefits is not in dispute.  At issue in this case is whether the debt in the amount of $7,030.20 for payment of monthly housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33 was properly created.  

The term "overpayment" refers only to those benefit payments made to a designated living payee or beneficiary in excess of the amount due or to which such payee or beneficiary is entitled.  An overpayment debt is created when VA determines that a beneficiary or payee has received monetary benefits to which he or she was not entitled. 38 U.S.C. § 5302; 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.911, 1.962.  

An overpayment of educational assistance paid to an eligible individual under Chapter 33 constitutes a liability of that individual, unless: (1) the overpayment was waived as provided in 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.957 and 1.962; or (2) the overpayment results from an administrative error or an error in judgment. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9695(b) (cross-referencing 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(r)).

For the Board to determine that the overpayment was not properly created, such that the debt was not valid, it must be established that the Veteran was legally entitled to the benefits in question or, if the Veteran was not legally entitled, then it must be shown that VA was solely responsible for the Veteran being erroneously paid benefits.

In the instant case, the Veteran was awarded Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits for his enrollment at Golden State University in San Francisco, California to pursue a graduate degree in Public Administration for the 2022 Summer term from June 29, 2022 through August 20, 2022.  VA received the enrollment certification (VA Form 22-1999) in June 2022.       

In January 2023, Golden State University notified VA via a Change in Enrollment Status (VA Form 22-1999b) that the Veteran had switched from in-person training to distance learning effective June 29, 2022, the first day of the term.  The same day, VA notified the Veteran via decision that due to corrections or changes to his Chapter 33 information, he had been paid more than what he was due for monthly housing allowance.  The letter explains that he was paid monthly housing allowance through "December 18, 2022," resulting in an overpayment of housing allowance benefits in the amount of $7,030.20. 

A January 2023 accounting sheet generated by the RO in connection with this claim reflects that for his enrollment, the Veteran received $331.40 in prorated housing allowance benefits for the period from June 29, 2022 through July 1, 2022; $4,971.00 for the period from July 1, 2022 through August 1, 2022; and $3,314.00 in prorated housing allowance benefits for the period from August 1, 2022 through August 20, 2022.  

The prorated amounts were paid at the $4.971.00 monthly rate. However, because the Veteran had switched from in-person training to distance learning effective June 29, 2022, the RO determined that he was only entitled to monthly housing allowance at half the national average of up to $938.50 for the school years from 2021-2023, and not based on his zip code as it is the case for in-person training.  

Accordingly, the RO determined that the Veteran should have instead received $60.30 in prorated housing allowance benefits at the $900.50 monthly rate for the period from June 29, 2022 through July 1, 2022; $900.50 for the period from July 1, 2022 through August 1, 2022; and $625.67 for the period from August 1, 2022 through August 20, 2022, at the $938.50 monthly rate.  The RO found that the Veteran initially received a total of $8,616.40 in monthly housing allowance for the 2022 Summer period in question for in-person training.  However, given his change to distance learning, he was only entitled to a total of $1,586.20.  Thus, this action created the overpayment in the amount of $7,030.20.   

In a subsequent February 14, 2023 decision, the RO retracted from the incorrect information provided in the January 23, 2023 decision (listing December 18, 2022 as the last date of housing allowance payments) and properly notified the Veteran that his overpayment resulted from the school's amended report for the 2022 Summer period from June 29, 2022 through August 20, 2022.  The RO explained that he had been paid monthly housing allowance benefits for 4 residence credit hours that were converted to 4 distance credit hours effective June 29, 2022.  As a result, VA had incorrectly overpaid him for the in-person housing rate instead of the distance learning rate for the period in question, which resulted in an overpayment of $7,030.20.  

The provisions of the Post-9/11 GI Bill provide for VA educational assistance for members of the Armed Forces based on active service after September 10, 2001. 38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520.  Under the provisions of Chapter 33, an individual who is pursuing a program of education at more than one-half time at an institution of higher learning located in the United States may receive a lump sum for established charges (tuition and fees) paid directly to the institution of higher learning; a monthly housing stipend; and for the first month of each quarter, semester, or term as applicable, a lump sum amount for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational costs. 38 U.S.C. § 3313; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9640.  

With relevance to present appeal, a monthly housing allowance is provided only for individuals with a rate of pursuit towards the objective of a program of education of more than 50 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9640(b).  For each month an individual pursues a program of education on more than a half-time basis, he or she is entitled to a monthly housing allowance equal to the monthly amount of the basic allowance for housing payable under 37 U.S.C. § 403 for a service member with dependents in pay grade E-5 residing in the military housing area that encompasses all or the majority portion of the zip code area in which is located the campus of the institution of higher learning where the individual physically participates in a majority of classes. 38 U.S.C. § 3313(c)(1)(B)(i)(I).  

In this case, the Veteran's 2022 Summer enrollment was considered more than a half-time basis.  According to the enrollment certifications of record, Golden State University is located in zip code 94105.  The monthly amount of the basic allowance for housing under that zip code that was payable to a service member with dependents in pay grade E-5 in 2022 was $4,971.00 per month.    

VA law also provides that in the case of an individual pursuing a program of education solely through distance learning on more than a half-time basis, a monthly housing stipend equal to 50 percent of the amount payable to the national average is warranted if the individual were otherwise entitled to a monthly housing stipend for pursuit of the program of education. 38 U.S.C. § 3313(c)(1)(B)(ii) and (iii).  In other words, individuals enrolled at more than a half-time basis are only entitled to monthly housing allowance at half the national average.  

As shown by the January 2023 accounting sheet, in this case, the Veteran was changed from in-person training to distance learning effective June 29, 2022, the first day of the term.  Accordingly, between 2021 and 2023 he was entitled to housing allowance at half the national average up to $938.50 per month.    

The RO concluded that the Veteran should have received $60.30 in prorated housing allowance benefits at the $900.50 monthly rate for the period from June 29, 2022 through July 1, 2022; the full half-time rate of $900.50 for the period from July 1, 2022 through August 1, 2022; and $625.67 in prorated housing allowance for the period from August 1, 2022 through August 20, 2022, at the $938.50 monthly rate.  

Because the Veteran had been paid a total of $8,616.40 when in effect was only entitled to $1,586.20, the overpayment was properly created.  This overpayment resulted from the Veteran's change from in-person to distance learning, regardless of the circumstances.  There is no evidence that calls the amount of the overpayment into question.   

The Board concludes that the evidence of record does not show or suggest an administrative error on the part of VA.  That is, VA paid the benefits based on the certifications of enrollment received from Golden State University in June 2022 and the "Change in Student Status" received in January 2023 for the Veteran's enrollment in a graduate degree in Public Administration from June 29, 2022 through August 20, 2022. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9695. 

In the May 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran advanced arguments in support of his claim aimed toward a discussion of whether he was at fault or not in the creation of the overpayment.  The Veteran argues that during the enrollment period in question he traveled for a short business trip to Incheon, Korea and tested positive for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) while abroad.  He asserts that the Korean government placed him in quarantine in his hotel room and he could not leave the country until he was symptom-free or that future COVID tests resulted negative.    Similarly, in his most recent Appellate Brief, the Veteran, through his representative, asserts that while the Veteran was attending college, he traveled to Incheon, Korea.  The entire country was under a full quarantine as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Veteran was unable to return to attend his courses.  

Public Law (P.L.) 116-128 was signed into law by the President of the United States on March 21, 2020.  The law addressed the continuation of VA Educational Assistance Benefits for certain programs of education converted to distance learning by reason of emergencies and health-related situations.  

Section 1(a) provides that in the case of a program of education approved by a State approving agency, or the Secretary when acting in the role of a State approving agency, "that is converted from being offered on-site at an educational institution to being offered by distance learning by reason of an emergency or health-related situation," as determined by the Secretary, the Secretary may continue to provide educational assistance under the laws administered by the Secretary without regard to such conversion, including, in pertinent part, with respect to paying any monthly housing allowance stipends under Chapter 33 of title 38, U.S.C.  

The statute further notes that the applicability period begins on March 1, 2020 and ends on December 21, 2020.  See Section 1(b).   Thereafter, Congress amended the applicability period to end on June 1, 2022 per P.L. 117-76, also known as the "Responsible Education Mitigating Options and Technical Extensions" or "Remote Act" of December 21, 2021, Section 1(b)).     

Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds that the enrollment period in this case began on June 29, 2022, past the extended applicability period of June 1, 2022 established by Congress by the enacting of P.L. 116-333 of December 21, 2021.  Unfortunately, the protections set forth by P.L. 116-128 of March 21, 2020, P.L. 116-140 of April 28, 2020, and P.L. 117-76 of December 21, 2021, with respect to the continuation of housing allowance payments at the same rate regardless of conversions from in-person to distance learning are not applicable to the facts of this case.    

The Board has further considered VA's guidance on its web page with respect to "Additional COVID Provisions of Remote Act."   The guidance provides that "[s]tudents who are attending converted distance learning courses that span the June 1, 2022 expiration date will continue to be eligible to receive MHA  at the resident rate until the end of the enrollment term or June 30, 2022, whichever occurs earlier."  The guidance further indicates that "after June 30, 2022, [the housing allowance] will be reduced to the online MHA rate if the student is taking all courses online."  As noted above, in this case, the Veteran's enrollment period in question began on June 29, 2022, after the June 1, 2022, expiration date.  Accordingly, this additional VA guidance neither applies to the facts of his case.  

Lastly, the Board notes that Congress enacted P.L. 117-333 of January 5, 2023.  The Statute introduced a "Subchapter I" to address emergency situations, such as the one addressed herein.  The new Section 3603 of Title 38, U.S.C., provides the following:

In the case of a program of education approved by a State approving agency, or the Secretary when acting in the role of a State approving agency, that is converted from being offered on-site at an educational institution or training establishment to being offered by distance learning by reason of an emergency or health-related situation, as determined by the Secretary, the Secretary may continue to provide educational assistance under the laws administered by the Secretary without regard to such conversion, including with respect to paying monthly housing stipends under Chapter 33 of this title. 

See P.L. 117-333, Sec. 2(a); see also 38 U.S.C. § 3603.  

However, the above statute is of applicability to emergency situations that occur after its enacting date, January 5, 2023.  In this regard, the United States Supreme Court has held that statutes generally may not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires that result. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994).  Accordingly, the Board cannot apply the foregoing statute prior to its effective date as it does not explicitly provide for retroactive application.  See also Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (in the context of regulations applicable to veterans law).

While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's assertions and finds no reason to deem his statements in support of his claim less than competent and credible (Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994)), in light of the fact that the Veteran was not legally entitled to the in-person housing allowance rate but to the distance learning rate from June 29, 2022 through August 20, 2022, as set forth by 38 U.S.C. § 3313(c)(1)(B)(ii), and because there was no administrative error on the part of VA in the creation of the overpayment, the calculated overpayment in the amount of $7,030.20, is valid. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9695.  

II

A waiver of recovery of overpayment of monthly housing allowance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, in the amount of $7,030.20

Recovery of overpayment of any benefits made under laws administered by VA shall be waived if there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of the person or persons having an interest in obtaining the waiver, and recovery of the indebtedness from the payee who received such benefits would be against equity and good conscience. 38 U.S.C. § 5302; 38 C.F.R. § 1.963(a). However, if there is an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith in the creation of the overpayment, waiver of the overpayment is automatically precluded, and further analysis is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.962, 1.963, 1.965.

In denying the Veteran's waiver request, the COWC did not find fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of the Veteran.  This constitutes a favorable finding under the rules of the modernized review system and the Board will not disturb it. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The validly created overpayment in this case is the result of the Veteran's change from in-person training to distance learning due to unforeseen medical complications beyond his control that prevented him from traveling back to the United States from Korea, while in the foreign country during a short business trip.  This supports the AOJ's finding that there is no indication that this debt is the result of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5302(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.963(a), 1.965(b).  

The next question for the Board is whether a waiver of recovery of the indebtedness is warranted on the basis of equity and good conscience under 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a) and 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.963(a), 1.965(a).

The standard of "equity and good conscience" will be applied when the facts and circumstances in a particular case indicate the need for reasonableness and moderation in the exercise of the Government's rights. 38 C.F.R. § 1.965(a).  The decision reached should not be unduly favorable or adverse to either side.  The phrase "equity and good conscience" means arriving at a fair decision between the obligor and the Government.

In making this determination, consideration will be given to the following elements, which are not intended to be all-inclusive: (1) the fault of the debtor; (2) balancing of faults between the debtor and VA; (3) undue hardship of collection on the debtor; (4) whether collection would defeat the purpose of an existing benefit to the veteran; (5) whether failure to collect a debt would result in the unjust enrichment of the veteran; and (6) whether the veteran changed positions to his detriment in reliance upon a granted VA benefit. 38 U.S.C. § 5302; 38 C.F.R. § 1.965(a); Ridings v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 544, 546 (1994).

After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that it would be against the principles of equity and good conscience to require the Veteran to repay the debt of $7,030.20. 

With respect to fault, as previously noted, the overpayment was created when the Veteran, while on a short business trip in Incheon, Korea was quarantined by the local government after testing positive for COVID-19.  The Veteran was held in the country until he was symptom-free or tested negative.  The Veteran was placed in quarantine in his hotel room, against his will, due to foreign health protocols.  This, in turn, forced him to change his enrollment from in-person training to distance learning as it was physically impossible to attend his class in person in San Francisco, California.  Thus, he is clearly at no fault in the creation of the overpayment.  Moreover, in his January 2023 Inquiry to VA, the Veteran credibly indicated that he connected to his class via Zoom from his hotel room.  In this regard, there is no indication in the education appeal file suggesting that the Veteran withdrew, had to repeat, or did not approve his course.  

As far as balancing faults, the Board finds that VA is not at fault in the creation of the debt.  After receiving information from Goden State University regarding the Veteran's change from in-person training to distance learning from his program of education, VA adjusted his benefits accordingly, and the overpayment was created. 38 C.F.R. § 1.965(a).  This is further supported by the Veteran's statements which unequivocally attributes the reason of the overpayment to this unexpected change and not VA's fault.  

Also, there is no indication that collection of the overpayment would defeat the purpose of an existing benefit, and there is no indication that the Veteran detrimentally changed his position in reliance on the overpayment. Id.  

As to whether collection of the overpayment constitutes an undue hardship, according to the March 2023 COWC decision, in Box 36 of the VA Form 5655 (Financial Status Report) received in support of this claim, the Veteran reported that the overpayment would not cause him an undue hardship.   Nonetheless, the Veteran indicated in Box 24B that he can pay $0 on a monthly basis toward his debt.  

The Financial Status Report further shows that the Veteran's net monthly income after expenses such as deductions from his salary, rent or mortgage, food and utilities is $262.86.  

After review of the Veteran's Financial Report and statements detailing his household obligations, to include the fact that the Veteran indicated that he can pay $0 toward his debt on a monthly basis, the Board believes that recovery of the debt would have a financial impact on the Veteran and would impair his ability to fulfill other legal obligations and obtain basic necessities.  Thus, the Board finds repayment would likely constitute an undue hardship for the Veteran.   

Next, the Board considers whether the recovery of the overpayment would defeat the purpose for which the benefits were intended.  It has not been shown that recovery of the overpayment would defeat the purpose of VA education benefits, which is to help eligible students complete a program of education by providing financial assistance.  Here, the record reflects that the benefits at issue were in fact used in an attempt from the Veteran to pursue a graduate program of education.  Although not legally entitled in retrospect, these education benefits were used for their intended purpose.  The Board also notes that the Veteran was still responsible for his housing payments back in the United States and had it not been because he tested positive to COVID-19 while in a foreign country, he would not have been placed in quarantine and would not have changed his enrollment from in-person training to distance learning. 

Regarding the fifth factor, the facts show that the Veteran was arguably enriched by the improper payment of VA benefits which allowed him an opportunity to pursue an educational program, thus increasing his earning potential in the future.  However, this unjust enrichment is tempered by the other factors described above, as well as by the fact that he was prevented from fully pursuing his program in-person in light of his unforeseen and unexpected positive testing for COVID-19 in a foreign country whose government mandated health protocols forced him to remain in quarantine.     

The final factor that the Board must consider is whether reliance on the benefits resulted in relinquishment of a valuable right or the incurrence of a legal obligation.  The Veteran has not contended with any specificity, nor does the evidence show, that he had relinquished a valuable right or incurred a legal obligation in reliance on his VA educational assistance benefits.

(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)

The Board concludes that the totality of the evidence weighs in favor of finding that recovery of the overpayment of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits in the total amount of $7,030.20 would be against equity and good conscience and potential financial hardship, to include defeating the purpose for which the benefit was intended.  The unique facts of this case dictate a need for reasonableness and moderation in the exercise of the Government's rights.  Accordingly, the Veteran's request for a waiver is granted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
