REMAND

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND 

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from October 1968 to October 1972.  He died in September 2021.  The appellant in this appeal is the Veteran's surviving spouse.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2025 Supplemental Claim rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which, in pertinent part, denied an effective date earlier than  August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.   

In March 2025, the appellant, through her attorney, Marcia Moellring, submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on which she identified the February 2025 rating decision, the issue as "Proper Effective Date for DIC based on Cause of Death," and elected the Direct Review docket.    

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2025 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that along with the appellant's March 2025 VA Form 10182, Ms. Moellring submitted a waiver of the time remaining to select a different Board Review Option and requested that the Board review her appeal as soon as possible.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).   

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for cause of the Veteran's death.  

The appellant contends that service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death should be effective from the date of his death.  

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

The effective date of an award of death benefits based on a post-service death is the first day of the month in which the Veteran's death occurred if the claim is received within 1 year after the date of death; otherwise, date of receipt of the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(c)(2).  

The Veteran's death certificate shows that he died in September 2021 and that the cause of his death was cerebrovascular accident with hemiplegia due to diabetic and chronic kidney disease.  At the time of his death, service connection was not in effect for any disability, although the Veteran had had a pending claim of service connection for diabetes mellitus, which he contended was the result of exposure to herbicide agents during his service in Thailand.  (The record indicated that the Veteran's claim had been denied on multiple prior occasions on the basis that the record did not show he had been exposed to herbicide agents during active duty.  See e.g. May 2021 Board decision).   

The record on appeal includes the Veteran's service treatment and personnel records which are entirely negative for complaints or findings of diabetes mellitus or to exposure to herbicide agents.  

In October 2021, shortly after the Veteran's death, the appellant submitted a VA Form 21-534EZ, Application for DIC, Survivors Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits, on which she sought service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  She also filed a request to be substituted as the claimant in the Veteran's pending claim of service connection for diabetes mellitus.  

In a May 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, finding that "Military records confirm the Veteran served in Thailand during the herbicide exposure presumptive period as defined in Public Law (PL) 117-168, Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022, or the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022; therefore, herbicide exposure is conceded."  The RO further determined that the clinical evidence showed that the Veteran had been diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus, type II, with diabetic nephropathy during his lifetime and that these conditions contributed to his death.  The RO established an effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection, corresponding to the effective date of the PACT Act.  

Thereafter, in a December 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for diabetes mellitus "on the basis of presumption due to herbicide exposure."  The RO also granted service connection for numerous disabilities determined to be complications of diabetes.  Despite its finding that service connection had been granted on the basis of a presumption of herbicide exposure, the RO assigned an effective date of April 25, 2016, which appears to correspond to the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim.  The RO provided no explanation for its assignment of that effective date.  

In March 2024, Ms. Moellring submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request:  Higher-Level Review, seeking review of the May 2023 rating decision assigning an effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  

Also in March 2024, Ms. Moellring sought review of numerous aspects of the December 2023 rating decision, arguing, inter alia, that higher ratings were warranted for various complications of diabetes such as left upper and lower extremity weakness, that a separate rating was warranted for facial droop and diabetic retinopathy, and that the RO should have assigned a total rating based on individual unemployability as well as special monthly compensation based on various theories of entitlement.  See March 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request:  Higher Level Review; March 2024 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request:  Supplemental Claim.  

In a June 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision, the RO denied an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of DIC benefits, explaining that because the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death benefits had been based on the PACT Act which became effective August 10, 2022, no earlier effective date was legally available.  

Somewhat incongruently, in a July 2024 Higher Level Review rating decision, the RO granted special monthly compensation based on the need for aid and attendance from December 26, 2019; granted service connection for right upper extremity weakness and assigned an initial 30 percent rating, effective December 26, 2019; granted service connection for left facial droop and assigned an initial 10 percent rating, effective April 25, 2016; and denied higher ratings for left upper and lower extremity weakness, right lower extremity neuropathy and lower extremity weakness.  The RO also identified a duty to assist error with respect to the claim for TDIU.   

In a September 2024 rating decision, the RO, in pertinent part, granted service connection for diabetic retinopathy and assigned an initial 30 percent rating effective April 25, 2016, and granted special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance from April 25, 2016. 

In September 2024, Ms. Moellring submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, seeking review of the March 2024 Higher Level Review rating decision denying an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  She argued that in light of the December 2023 and July 2024 rating decisions granting service connection for diabetes mellitus and related complications from April 25, 2016, an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death was warranted.  

Ms. Moellring's argument apparently prompted the RO to review its prior decisions granting service connection from April 25, 2016.  As a result, in the February 2025 rating decision now on appeal, the RO denied an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  The RO also proposed to sever service connection for diabetes mellitus and related complications, explaining that the December 2023 rating decision had granted service connection based on the presumption of exposure to herbicides in Thailand, provided by the PACT Act.  Because that Act did not become effective until August 10, 2022, after the Veteran's death, the award of service connection was clearly and unmistakably erroneous.  

In a February 2025 letter, the RO advised the appellant that she had 60 days from the date of the letter to submit additional evidence showing that the proposed severance should not take place, or 30 days to request a predetermination hearing.  The record currently before the Board contains no indication that the appellant or Ms. Moellring submitted additional evidence or requested a hearing.  The RO has not yet taken action on the proposed severance.  

Given the applicable legal criteria and the evidence of record, the Board finds that the issue currently on appeal is inextricably intertwined with the proposed severance.  Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991) (two issues are "inextricably intertwined" when they are so closely tied together that a final decision on one issue cannot be rendered until a decision on the other issue has been rendered.).  Therefore, the issue on appeal must be remanded for correction of an error by the AOJ in satisfying a statutory or regulatory duty.  See Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127, 136 (2024) (remand for correction of an error by the AOJ in satisfying a statutory or regulatory duty required when the Board grants service connection in same appeal seeking a total rating based on individual unemployability).  

This matter is REMANDED for the following:

After issuing a decision on the severance proposed in the February 2025 rating decision, adjudicate the issue of entitlement to an effective earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.
