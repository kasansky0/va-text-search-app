ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his tinnitus is at least as likely as not related to hazardous noise exposure during service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§1101, 1110, 1154 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.30, 3.307, 3.309(a) 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1971 to August 1975.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 Rating Decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  On May 28, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), but identified a December 2015 Rating Decision. The Board accepted and docketed the May 28, 2024 appeal.  The Veteran also submitted a June 2024 Notice of Disagreement, choosing the Direct Review docket and identifying the May 2024 Rating Decision. This second Notice of Disagreement was treated as a duplicate appeal.

In July 2024, the Board sent a letter to the Veteran regarding the May 2024 Notice of Disagreement appealing the 2015 Rating Decision, informing him that this would be a Legacy appeal and that he would need to file a Form 21-0958 Notice of Disagreement and submit a good cause extension request.  The letter attached a Form 21-0958. The Veteran responded by filing the Form 21-0958 and selecting the Decision Review Officer (DRO) Review Process.  The Board notes that this legacy appeal concluded when the Veteran did not submit a timely appeal following a September 2016 Statement of the Case (SOC).

This decision addresses the AMA appeal filed May 28, 2024 under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), appealing the February 2024 Rating Decision.  The Veteran chose the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Some chronic diseases, including organic diseases of the nervous system like sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, may be presumed to have been incurred in service, if they become manifest to a degree of ten percent or more within the applicable presumptive period. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101(3), 1112(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a), 3.309(a). For those listed chronic conditions, a showing of continuity of symptoms affords an alternative route to service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The applicable presumptive period is one year from separation.

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability that are subject to lay observation. 38 U.S.C. § 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Moreover, the Board notes that tinnitus is a type of disability that may be established on the basis of lay evidence alone. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The May 2024 Rating Decision made the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 5104A

The Veteran claims that his tinnitus was caused by noise exposure during his active military service. Specifically, the Veteran claims that his tinnitus was caused by prolonged exposure while in the Navy as a jet engine mechanic. The Veteran's military occupation specialty (MOS) was as a machinist's mate. See Military Personnel Record.   Based on this evidence, the Board concedes that the Veteran experienced hazardous military noise exposure. Therefore, the dispositive issue is whether there is a nexus between the in-service hazardous noise exposure and the current tinnitus.

In the Veteran's March 2016 Notice of Disagreement and in his March 2024 lay statement, the Veteran reported that he suffered from long-standing gradually worsening tinnitus. He reported tinnitus seemed to start during his time in the service as he was around loud jet engines and machinery. The Veteran also reported that despite using ear protection the almost constant roar of the jet engines on the tarmac could not be sufficiently muffled by the ear protection that was issued to him in service. The Veteran reported in medical treatment records that he's had "ringing in his ears for years with the right ear being worse than the left." See CAPRI records, submitted June 2023.

An August 2015 VA examination determined that the Veteran's tinnitus was not service connected because he did not complain about it until 2012. The May 2024 Rating Decision denied service connection for the Veteran's tinnitus based on the 2014 VA examination opinion that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's tinnitus was due to military noise exposure.   

While the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not show any complaints of, or treatment for, ringing in the ears while in service, the Veteran reported that his tinnitus began in service and has continued to this day.  The Board finds that the Veteran is competent to report the onset and progression of his tinnitus.

The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus was caused by in-service hazardous noise exposure.  

As any reasonable doubt created must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
