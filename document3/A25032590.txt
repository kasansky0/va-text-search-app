REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for anxiety and depression with insomnia is remanded.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 18, 2023 for the grant of service connection for anxiety and depression with insomnia is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 1992 to April 1997.

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for anxiety and depression with insomnia, assigning a 50 percent initial rating effective May 18, 2023, in a September 2023 rating decision (RD).

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review (HLR)) in September 2023, seeking higher level review of the initial rating and effective date assigned.

The AOJ confirmed the initial rating and effective date assigned in a February 2024 HLR RD.

The Veteran subsequently submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD)) in May 2024, appealing these issues and choosing the "Direct Review" lane.  As such, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, that is, evidence submitted prior to September 11, 2023.

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for anxiety and depression with insomnia is remanded.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 18, 2023 for the grant of service connection for anxiety and depression with insomnia is remanded.

In a separately docketed appeal, (docket # 211126-200748), the Veteran sought entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  In this decision, the Board noted that the Veteran was already service connected for anxiety and depression with insomnia associated with right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy.  Given this, the Board expanded the scope of the claim to include these diagnoses, and characterized the issue as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include PTSD.  

Notably, in September 2024, the Board in the separately docketed appeal (docket # 211126-200748), remanded the claim to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  As all psychiatric disabilities are rated under a General Rating Formula, the further development and readjudication of the acquired psychiatric disorder claim in docket # 211126-200748, may affect the resolution of the claim in this appeal, (docket # 240531-444930), as to entitlement to an increased initial rating and earlier effective date for anxiety and depression with insomnia.  Where a decision on one issue may have a "significant impact" on another, the two claims are inextricably intertwined.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991); Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443 (1994); Henderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 11 (1998).  Thus, the claim for entitlement to an increased initial rating and earlier effective date for anxiety and depression with insomnia claim must be remanded to allow the AOJ to first readjudicate the acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, claim.

The Veteran is notified that under the modernized appeal system, remands do not automatically return to the Board for additional adjudication.  Should the AOJ deny the claim in whole or in part and the Veteran wishes to continue his appeal before the Board, the Veteran must file an appropriate NOD (VA Form 10182) within the applicable appeal period after the AOJ's readjudication of the claim.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ should complete the development and readjudication of the separately docketed claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, remanded by the Board in September 2024.  After this action is completed, and following any additional development deemed necessary, the AOJ should then readjudicate the increased initial rating and earlier effective date for anxiety and depression with insomnia claims.
