ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's chronic hypertension is related to his active-duty service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1974 to August 1979 and November 2001 to December 2002.      

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2021 rating decision, including a good-cause extension of time for the delayed review due to Covid-19.  In May 2023, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error during the HLR and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim lane.  In February 2024, the AOJ issued the decision on appeal which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran has continuously pursued a January 2021 claim that sought to readjudicate a previous claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension denied in a November 2018 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension

The Veteran asserts that his hypertension is related to service.  See June 2024 Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182).  Specifically, the Veteran contends that his hypertension is caused by his service-connected frequent/uncontrolled difficulty urination disability.  See July 2018 Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 21-526EZ).  The Veteran also contends that he had hypertension while on active duty in October 2001 through 2003, which the military doctors failed to diagnose.  See April 2021 Correspondence.  

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or?unpersuasive and?provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?36, 39-40 (1994).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.

Generally, the degree of probative value which may be attributed to a medical opinion issued by a VA or private treatment provider takes into account such factors as its thoroughness and degree of detail, and whether there was review of the claims file.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (2021); Ortiz?v.?Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Here, in the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension; a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service - service treatment records (STRs) from January 11, 2001 to November 30, 2002 show elevated blood pressure readings; the Veteran has sufficient service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection, serving 90 days or more during a period of war or after December 31, 1946; and the Veteran is service connected for frequent/uncontrolled difficulty urination.  See February 2024 Rating Decision.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  

Thus, the only question remaining for the Board is nexus.  After a thorough review of the evidence, the Board finds service connection for hypertension is warranted on a direct basis.    

For VA purposes, hypertension is defined as diastolic blood pressure predominantly at 90 millimeters (mm) or greater.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.  A 10 percent rating for hypertension under Diagnostic Code 7101 is assigned when: (1) diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more; or (2) systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more; or (3) if there is a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more with continuous medication for required control.

Note (1) provides that hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days. For purposes of this section, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm. or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm.

In a December 2020 letter, G.C., a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, opined that the Veteran's chronic hypertension more likely than not started while on active duty in the Air Force.  He noted his review of the in-service and post-service medical records.  He also indicated the Veteran's hypertension was chronic, and his blood pressure was checked several time during medical examinations on active duty, highlighting a blood pressure reading of 158/81 on October 31, 2002 and 143/86 on April 4, 2002.

Indeed, the Veteran's STRs reveal multiple high blood pressure readings during service. In addition to those highlighted by Dr. G.C., the Veteran's STRs indicate blood pressure readings of 142/90 on June 28, 2001; 160/94 on January 22, 2002; and 143/96 on October 1, 2002.  See STRs received March 2005 and March 2013 STR.  Collectively, the three readings were taken on three different days, during the Veteran's service.  The readings show a diastolic pressure predominantly 90mm or greater, and systolic blood pressure predominantly 160mm. or greater, with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm.  

The Veteran filed an April 2021 correspondence in which he reported that his blood pressure readings were high while in service from October 2001 through 2003.  See April 2021 Correspondence.  The medical facility at Hurlburt AFB, FI Clinic, failed to diagnose him with hypertension during this period of service, and he was living with the disease during this time.  The doctors always advised him to take a baby aspirin daily, and never told him that his blood pressure readings were elevated.  

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the STRs reveal onset of hypertension symptoms during service.  Moreover, Dr. G.C. provided sufficient rationale to link the Veteran's chronic hypertension with the elevated in-service hypertension readings.    

The Board notes an August 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's hypertension was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner reasoned that there is insufficient evidence to support a nexus between the current diagnosis of hypertension and military service. Without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology.   However, the Board affords this opinion no probative weight as the August 2023 VA examiner did not consider the Veteran's medical history of elevated blood pressure readings starting in service and continuing since service, did not address the positive opinion from Dr. G.C., and appeared to improperly rely on the lack of an in-service diagnosis for hypertension as the basis for the opinion.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007) (an opinion is inadequate when the examiner does not consider the Veteran's medical history); McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243, 256 (2019); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) ("It is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion... that contributes probative value to a medical opinion").  

For the above reasons, based on the competent and credible lay and medical evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection for hypertension is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(b).
