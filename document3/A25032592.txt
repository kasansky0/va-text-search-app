ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for service-connected sleep apnea is dismissed.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for service-connected left shoulder strain is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to issuance of a decision on this issue, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received an October 2024 statement from the Veteran's attorney withdrawing his appeal of the issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for service-connected sleep apnea. 

2. The January 2024 VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision effectuating the Board's July 2023 grant of entitlement to a 20 percent rating for service-connected left shoulder strain is not an appealable decision.  Further, the Veteran withdrew this appeal in October 2024. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal of the issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for service-connected sleep apnea have been met.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for service-connected left shoulder strain have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1989 to October 2005.

By a January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ effectuated the July 2023 Board decision granting a 20 percent rating for service-connected left shoulder strain, effective April 16, 2016.  By a July 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for sleep apnea and assigned the same an initial 50 percent rating, effective April 16, 2016.  

The Veteran filed a timely September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement NOD)), to the cited rating decisions, electing to be heard by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) of the Board.  Due to the nature of the disposition of the issues herein, that they are dismissed, the Board need not consider whether the requested Board hearing was held or identify the appellate time period during which it may consider evidence.

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for service-connected sleep apnea.

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board issues a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  The withdrawal may be made by the Appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  Appeal withdrawals must be in writing, must include the name of the claimant, the applicable claim number, and a statement that the appeal is being withdrawn, and must be received by the Board prior to issuance of a decision on the claim or claims being withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b).

Prior to issuing a decision on the issue, the Board received an October 2024 statement from the Veteran's attorney withdrawing his appeal.  The statement is in writing and includes the Veteran's name and claim number.  It clearly states that the appeal is being withdrawn; the criteria for withdrawal of an appeal are satisfied.  See id.  

As there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law respecting the issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for service-connected sleep apnea, the appeal is dismissed.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for service-connected left shoulder strain. 

As discussed above, a July 2023 Board decision granted a 20 percent rating for service-connected left shoulder strain, effective April 16, 2016.  That Board decision was effectuated by a January 2024 AOJ decision.  The Veteran attempted to appeal the January 2024 AOJ decision by submitting his September 2024 NOD.  

However, this issue must be dismissed as a matter of law.  A Board decision is the final and conclusive determination of the Secretary as to any discrete issue decided in that decision, and a pure implementation of a Board decision cannot be regarded as a decision affecting the provision of benefits.  Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 31 (2023).  A rating decision that implements a grant of benefits by the Board is not a "decision" for appeal purposes, as the issue has already been determined by another part of the agency.  Rather, such a rating decision is merely ministerial in nature.  Id.  

Because the January 2024 AOJ decision that effectuated the July 2023 Board decision was not appealable to the Board, the Board cannot accept the September 2024 NOD as to that issue.  Accordingly, the appeal of the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for service-connected left shoulder

strain is dismissed as a matter of law.  Further, the Board notes that the Veteran withdrew this appeal in an October 2024 statement.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.
