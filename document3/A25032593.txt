ORDER

Entitlement to restoration of a 10 percent rating for right foot great toe gout is granted effective July 24, 2023.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against demonstrating that the Veteran's right big toe gout has actually undergone an improvement in the ordinary conditions of life and work.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The rating reduction for right big toe gout from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective July 24, 2023, was improper, and restoration of the 10 percent rating is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.344, 4.13, 4.2, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5017-5284.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1994 to August 1999, June 2004 to November 2005, May 2010 to August 2010, August 2011 to December 2011, October 2015 to December 2015, July 2017 to November 2017, and April 2020 to September 2020.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 2023 decision.  In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 2023 decision.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  In his 10182, the Veteran elected to appeal both the August 2023 and the March 2024 rating decisions.  However, this would be a prohibited concurrent election and the Board will view this matter as being on appeal from the later March 2024 rating decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  Regardless of which decision is on appeal, the evidence window is the same.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As a final preliminary matter, in his March 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also appealed an August 2021 rating decision denying service connection for a neck disability and vertigo.  The 10182 is untimely, as it was filed more than a year after the 2021 rating decision.  The 2021 rating decision is also the most recent to address those issues, and there is not another decision he could have timely appealed.  

Entitlement to restoration of a 10 percent rating for right foot great toe gout is granted effective July 24, 2023.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a restoration of his 10 percent rating for his right toe gout.  The Board agrees.

Procedural requirements for ratings reduction.

Where the reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability or employability status is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 requires the following: (1) a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance setting forth all material facts and reasons; (2) notification to the Veteran at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and detailed reasons for that action; and (3) a final rating action to reduce the Veteran's disability award in the amount that he was notified of.

The required notification must advise the Veteran that he or she has 60 days to present additional evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at their present level. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e). The notice must also advise the Veteran of his or her right to a predetermination hearing, which must be requested within 30 days of the notice to continue the benefits at the current rate.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (i).

Here, the reduction in evaluation for right toe gout did not result in a reduction of the Veteran's overall disability award.  See August 2023 rating decision finding the "decision will not impact your overall combined evaluation of 90 percent".  Therefore, the RO did not need to comply with the procedural notice requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.  Accordingly, VA has satisfied the procedural requirements detailed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

Substantive requirements for ratings reduction.

In every reduction case, there must be a finding of improvement.  In Murphy v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 510 (2014), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) stated that the RO and Board are required "in any rating-reduction case" to determine (1) "based upon review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability"; (2) "whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based upon thorough examinations"; and (3) whether any improvement "actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work."  Murphy, 26 Vet. App. at 517 (citing 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10, and 4.13 (1992) and quoting Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 421 (1993)).

Even where the assigned rating is less than five years old and 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c) applies, improvement in a Veteran's ability to function must still be shown under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 420-21.

A determination that a disability has improved must be based upon a review of the entire history of the disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10 (2017); see Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991) ("Whether or not a disability has improved cannot be determined without reference to prior records detailing the history of that condition").  VA must then ascertain whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based on thorough and adequate examinations.  Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000).  See also Tucker v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 201 (1992) (holding that an examiner's failure to review the claims file rendered the reduction decision void).

The Veteran is rated under Diagnostic Codes 5017-5284, meaning he is rated for gout (DC 5017) by analogy to a foot injury (DC 5284).

The criteria for rating musculoskeletal disabilities, including DC 5017 pertaining to gout, have changed, effective February 7, 2021.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 76453 (Nov. 30, 2020).  Prior to February 7, 2021, the rating schedule provided that DC 5017 for gout was to be rated based on DC 5002.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  From February 7, 2021, DC 5017 pertaining to gout is to be rated based on limitation of the affected parts.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  

As the relevant period is after February 7, 2021, the Veteran is rated based on the limitation of his right big toe.  Under DC 5284, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate symptoms, a 20 percent rating is warranted for moderately severe symptoms, and a 30 percent rating is warranted for severe symptoms.  With actual loss of use of the foot, a 40 percent rating is assigned under DC 5167.  The criteria for DC 5284 were not changed as part of the February 7, 2021, amendment.

The rating schedule does not define words such as "moderate" or "severe."  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decision is "equitable and just."  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  

By way of background, the Veteran is service connected for gout in both his big toes.  Although the right toe is at issue in this claim, a July 2017 left big toe VA examination states "[h]e had several Gout attacks however once he started taking Allopurinol daily and has had a significant decrease in the amount of attacks he experiences."  Similarly, an August 2017 VA examination states, "[s]ince Veteran has been taking Allopurinol he has not had an incident that was incapacitating.  Without Allopurinol use he would have flare ups that would leave him unable to ambulate because of pain in the Left [big toe]."

In January 2021, VA examined both big toes for gout.  The Veteran reported weekly mild pain in both big toes, which lasts for hours.  He also reported treating with diet management, Allopurinol, and Colcrys.  The examiner noted flare-ups causing pain, weakness, fatigability, or incoordination.  The Veteran lost between 0 to 1 weeks of work over the past 12 months due to his gout.  The examiner marked that the Veteran had mild severity bilaterally.  

An August 2021 rating decision granted service connection for the Veteran's right big toe gout and assigned a 10 percent rating effective September 25, 2020.  In June 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking an increased rating for his right big toe gout.  

In July 2023, VA examined the Veteran again to determine the current severity of his right big toe gout.  The examination only refers to left foot/toe conditions, however, and the evidence cited refers only to the left toe.  The examiner marked that the Veteran had moderate severity symptoms, and that the Veteran's left toe gout had progressed/worsened.  The examiner remarked, "[h]e is service connected for the left great toe gout, he has no condition of the right foot/toe."  

An August 2023 rating decision reduced the Veteran's rating from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective July 24, 2023 (the date of the examination).  In March 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Request for a Higher-Level Review, arguing he still has gout in his right foot, and the reduction to 0 percent was not warranted.  The RO denied the Veteran's claim in a March 2024 rating decision.  As noted, the Veteran appealed in June 2024.

After the Veteran's appeal, an August 2024 rating decision granted an increased rating of 10 percent, effective April 3, 2024.  The decision did not restore the Veteran's rating for the entire period at issue.  Thus, there is still an issue of whether the Veteran is entitled to a restoration of his 10 percent rating from July 24, 2023.  

The July 2023 examination appears to be the sole evidence used to reduce the Veteran's rating.  However, the examiner's remark ("[h]e is service connected for the left great toe gout, he has no condition of the right foot/toe") is inaccurate.  As noted, the Veteran was diagnosed with and service connected for gout in both big toes by the time of the examination.  See, e.g., Codesheet, January 2021 VA examination (diagnosing gout in the Veteran's left and right big toes.)  Further, the Veteran had just filed an increased rating claim for his right toe, which he would not do unless he felt the condition had worsened.  This opinion is inadequate as to the right big toe gout.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (an opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).

Finally, there is no evidence suggesting that the Veteran's right big toe gout improved or resolved.  Instead, the evidence suggests the opposite.  The July 2023 remark incorrectly suggests only that the Veteran had no diagnosis for his right foot, but not that the condition improved or resolved.  The prior examinations noted that the Veteran treated his symptoms with diet management and medications and rated his right toe at 10 percent.  The Veteran remained on the same medication the next two years, but still reported worsening symptoms, not improvement.  The 2023 examiner also found that the left toe had worsened over those two years, and it would be unusual if one toe got better, while the other worsened on the same treatment regimen.  

Accordingly, improvement has not been shown, and the Veteran is entitled to restoration of his 10 percent rating for his right big toe gout effective July 24, 2023.
