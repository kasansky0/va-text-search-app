FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder on June 3, 2022, that was broadly construed as a claim for any acquired psychiatric disorder, to include adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  The Veteran did not submit any documents prior to June 3, 2022, that could be construed as an intent to file a claim of service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.

2. Resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, he submitted an intent to file a claim on April 29, 2023, before following up with a claim of service connection for tinnitus disorder on May 3, 2023.

3. The severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms caused by adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood did not more closely approximate occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity from June 3, 2022.

4. The severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms caused by adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood did not more closely approximate occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

5. The Veteran's lumbosacral strain with spondylosis (also claimed as lumbar strain, lumbar sprain, low back sprain, low back condition, back condition, low back condition), from April 13, 2023, is manifest by forward flexion to 50 degrees without ankylosis and no IVDS.

6. The Veteran's service-connected tinnitus is assigned a 10 percent rating, which is the maximum schedular rating authorized for tinnitus under Diagnostic Code 6260, for either a unilateral or bilateral disability.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Navy from January 2007 to March 2008. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from determinations by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued in July 2023,  December 2023, and May 2024 under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  In June 2024, the Veteran appealed such decision to the Board and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  

In pertinent part, the July 2023 rating decision assigned a 50 percent rating from April 13, 2023, for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood; a 20 percent rating for lumbosacral strain with spondylosis from April 13, 2023; denied service connection for sleep apnea; and granted service connection for tinnitus from April 13, 2023.  The December 2023 rating decision denied a rating greater than 50 percent for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression from April 13, 2023; denied a rating greater than 10 percent for tinnitus; assigned an effective date of May 3, 2023, for tinnitus; denied a rating greater than 30 percent for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood; and denied an effective date earlier than June 3, 2022, for mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  In May 2024, the AOJ denied service connection for sleep apnea.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the December 2023 rating decision was the result of a timely August 2023 Higher Level Review from the Veteran regarding the rating decisions issued in August 2022, November 2022, December 2022, January 2023, and July 2023.  The Board, however, notes that the Veteran had already submitted a VA Form 10182 in December 2022, appealing the decisions issued in March 2022, August 2022, September 2022, November 2022, and December 2022.

When a claim is denied under the AMA, a claimant may either elect to submit a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or submit an appeal to the Board.  A claimant cannot elect multiple review options simultaneously for the same claim.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501.  Such concurrent election is specifically prohibited by 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(b), which states, a "claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option."

As there was an already-pending appeal of the issues decided in the August 2022, November 2022, and December 2022 rating decisions, they are not presently before the Board.  The Board notes that in January 2025, the claims appealed in the December 2022 VA Form 10182 were adjudicated by the Board.

Turning to the claims on appeal, under the Direct Review docket, the Board is authorized to review only the evidence considered by the AOJ at the time of the rating decisions which was the subject of the December 2023 higher level review.  The Board may not consider evidence presented outside of the timeframes discussed above.  Therefore, evidence provided following the July 2023 rating decision has not been considered by the Board in its decision on the claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Thus, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the decision on July 21, 2023, for all issues other than the issue of service connection for sleep apnea.  For sleep apnea, a duty to assist error was identified in December 2023 and was denied on May 23, 2024, so evidence associated with the Veteran's file prior to the May 2024 rating decision will be reviewed.

Earlier Effective Date

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The effective date upon receipt of new and material evidence after a final disallowance will be the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2).  If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

A decision assigning an effective date for a service-connected disability becomes final when the decision is not appealed, and an appellant can only attempt to overcome finality of the decision by a request for revision based on clear and unmistakable error, or by a claim to reopen based upon new and material evidence.  However, because the proper effective date for an award based on claim to reopen could be no earlier than the date on which that claim was received, only a request for revision based on clear and unmistakable error could result in the assignment of an earlier effective date.  See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299 (2006).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 3, 2022, for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than June 3, 2022, for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood ("anxiety").

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued this claim from June 3, 2022, when he submitted a claim of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that the VA broadly construed as a claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  Following the August 2022 rating decision denying the claim of service connection for PTSD, he sought higher-level review in September 2022, resulting in a grant of service connection for anxiety in January 2023.  He then sought higher-level review in August 2023, within a year of the January 2023 rating decision, and the claim was decided in a December 2023 rating decision that is currently on appeal.  Thus, the claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 3, 2022, is properly before the Board.

Turning to the claim, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran did not submit any documents that could be construed as a claim of service connection for anxiety or even an intent to file for his anxiety prior to June 3, 2022, especially since the current effective date is only made possible by a liberal interpretation of the Veteran's PTSD claim on June 3, 2022.

In sum, the Veteran is already in receipt of the earliest possible effective date for his service-connected anxiety.  As the evidence weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53-56.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 3, 2023, for tinnitus

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than May 3, 2023, for tinnitus.

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran submitted an intent to file on April 12, 2023, and again on April 29, 2023.  The Veteran then filed a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking greater ratings for diabetes mellitus type II, adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, and lumbosacral strain.  The Board thus finds that the April 12, 2023, intent to file was for these claims, and not for tinnitus.  Following the April 29, 2023, intent to file, however, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ on May 3, 2023.  Resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the April 29, 2023, intent to file was for the claim of service connection for tinnitus that immediately followed.

Accordingly, an effective date of April 29, 2023, but no earlier, for tinnitus is warranted.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  It is not expected that every case will show every criterion for a particular rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).

Where a claimant appeals the initial rating assigned following an award of service connection, evidence contemporaneous with the claim for service connection and with the rating decision granting service connection would be most probative of the degree of disability existing at the time that the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an [initial] rating on appeal was erroneous."  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  If later evidence obtained during the appeal period indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, "staged" ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found.  Id.

3. A rating greater than 30 percent for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood from June 3, 2022

4. A rating greater than 50 percent for unspecified depressive disorder (previously rated as adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood) from April 13, 2023

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to higher ratings for his adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood ("anxiety").  For the period on appeal, he is in receipt of a 30 percent rating from June 3, 2022, and a 50 percent rating from April 13, 2023, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 9440.  

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 30 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, due to such symptoms as:  depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events).  See Id.

A 50 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect, circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to compete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  See Id.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when there is objective evidence demonstrating occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  See Id.

A 100 percent rating is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment, due to symptoms such as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger or hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  See Id.

In Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that use of the term "such as" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating.  Accordingly, the evidence considered in determining the level of impairment under section 4.130 is not restricted to the symptoms provided in the diagnostic code.  Rather, VA must consider all symptoms of a claimant's condition that affect the level of occupational and social impairment, including, if applicable, those identified in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

More recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Court) held that "a veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration."  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 116 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  The Federal Circuit explained that in the context of a 70 percent rating, section 4.130 "requires not only the presence of certain symptoms but also that those symptoms have caused occupational and social impairment in most of the referenced areas."  Id. at 118.  The Federal Circuit indicated that "[a]lthough the veteran's symptomatology is the primary consideration, the regulation also requires an ultimate factual conclusion as to the veteran's level of impairment in 'most areas.'"  Id.

In January 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his claim of service connection for PTSD.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran as having adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, and that he had occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.  Symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, and chronic sleep impairment were observed.

In a January 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for anxiety and assigned an initial 30 percent rating from June 3, 2022.  

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking a rating greater than 30 percent for his anxiety.  Although this form does not establish continuous pursuit per 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(b), as discussed above, the Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 0996 in August 2023 and therefore continuously pursued his claim.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination on April 18, 2023.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms resulted in "occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity," meeting the criteria for a 50 percent rating.  Specifically, the examiner noted symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting.  The examiner remarked that while symptoms are consistent with the criteria for a higher rating, the "severity of symptoms does not warrant an indication of this impairment" and that the Veteran's functioning is "best described as 'occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.'"

In a July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ increased the rating to 50 percent from April 13, 2023.

In a December 2023 Higher Level Review, the AOJ continued its denial, but also decided that a rating greater than 30 percent for anxiety is denied and that entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to June 3, 2022, is denied.

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's anxiety does not warrant a rating greater than 30 percent prior to April 13, 2023, nor a rating greater than 50 percent thereafter.

Prior to April 13, 2023

There is no evidence of record, lay or medical, showing symptoms of flattened affect, panic attacks more than once a week, difficulty in understanding complex commands, impairment of short and long-term memory, impaired judgment, impaired abstract thinking, or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships that result in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

Although the Veteran has occasional symptoms that could support a higher rating, the Veteran's symptoms do not, on balance, cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to these symptoms.  The January 2023 examiner noted that the Veteran's symptoms better fit the description of occupational and social impairment with "occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks" rather than "reduced reliability and productivity."  

Other medical evidence of record also supports the January 2023 VA examination as the Veteran was consistently described as being alert and oriented with normal affect and speech during his visits for other ailments, as well as during visits for mental health. 

Therefore, in view of the evidence of record, the Veteran does not exhibit objective symptomatology that would be sufficient to warrant a rating greater than 30 percent.  Of note, although the Veteran may exhibit some symptoms of a higher rating, a holistic review of the Veteran's symptoms, such as consistently normal speech, thought process, judgment, and insight, without any signs of panic attacks, significant memory impairment, a psychosis, suicidal ideations, or thought disorder, demonstrate that his symptoms are better categorized by the 30 percent rating.  See Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 115-17.  Moreover, some of the symptoms listed in the diagnostic code for a higher rating have not been shown at all.

In summary, the most probative evidence reflects that the criteria for a rating greater than 30 percent for anxiety have not been met prior to April 13, 2023.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9440.  As the evidence weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53-56.

From April 13, 2023

There is no evidence of record from April 13, 2023, lay or medical, showing symptoms of: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control; spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

Therefore, in view of the evidence of record, the Veteran does not exhibit objective symptomatology that would be sufficient to warrant a rating greater than 50 percent.  Of note, although the Veteran may exhibit some symptoms of a higher rating, such as difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting, a holistic review of the Veteran's symptoms demonstrate that his symptoms are better categorized by the 50 percent rating.  See Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 115-17.  Moreover, some of the symptoms listed in the diagnostic code for a higher rating have not been shown at all.

In summary, the most probative evidence reflects that the criteria for a rating greater than 50 percent for anxiety have not been met prior to March 2, 2018.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9440.  

5. A rating greater than 20 percent for lumbosacral strain with spondylosis (also claimed as lumbar strain, lumbar sprain, low back sprain, low back condition, back condition, low back condition), from April 13, 2023.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a rating greater than 20 percent for lumbosacral strain with spondylosis ("lumbar disability").  He is in receipt of a 20 percent rating from April 13, 2023, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5237. 

A rating of 20 percent under DC 5237 is warranted when the evidence demonstrates: forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5237.

A rating of 40 percent is warranted when the evidence demonstrates: forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  Id.

A rating of 50 percent is warranted when the evidence demonstrates unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine, and a rating of 100 percent is warranted when the evidence demonstrates unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  Id.

Additionally, spine disabilities based intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) with incapacitating episodes may be rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5243.  A rating under DC 5243 is warranted when the evidence demonstrates: incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least one week but less than 2 weeks during the past 12 months (10 percent); or incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months (20 percent). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5243.

In a January 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for a rating greater than 10 percent for his service-connected lumbar disability.

In April 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his lumbar disability.  He reported daily flare-ups lasting 6 to 7 hours per day that are alleviated by rest and ibuprofen.  Range of motion was 60 degrees for forward flexion, 10 degrees for extension, 10 degrees for bilateral lateral flexion, and 20 degrees for bilateral lateral rotation.  Passive range of motion testing was performed and was the same as active range of motion.  There was evidence of pain in nonweight-bearing, active motion, passive motion, and caused functional loss.  Range of motion during flare-ups were estimated to be 50 degrees forward flexion, 0 degrees extension, while bilateral lateral flexion and rotation remained the same.  The examiner cited pain and fatigability as the causes for reduced range of motion during flare-ups.  There was localized tenderness but did not result in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour.  There was no ankylosis and no intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS).

For an evaluation greater than 20 percent, the Veteran's lumbar disability would have to show forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less, or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DCs 5235-42.  As he does not have a diagnosis of IVDS, DC 5243 does not apply.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5243.

As discussed above, however, the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine showed forward flexion to an estimated 50 degrees even during a flare-up, and there was no diagnosis of ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  The Board also notes that the Veteran himself described his flare-ups as flares of pain, and did not specifically report any loss in range of motion.  The April 2023 examiner also performed weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, active and passive range of motion testing as he noted evidence of pain in nonweight-bearing, active and passive motion before estimating the reduced range of motion during flare-ups.

For the foregoing reasons, the weight of the evidence reflects that the criteria for a 40 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected lumbar disability have not been met or more nearly approximated.  The benefit-of-the-doubt-doctrine is therefore not for application and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

6. A rating greater than 10 percent for service-connection for tinnitus

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a rating greater than 10 percent for tinnitus.

Tinnitus is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260, which was revised effective June 13, 2003, to clarify the existing VA practice that only a single 10 percent rating is assigned for tinnitus, whether the sound is perceived as being in one ear, both ears, or in the head.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260.

The Veteran has already been assigned the maximum schedular rating of 10 percent, under DC 6260, and there is no legal basis upon which to award a higher or separate schedular evaluation for tinnitus.

Ordinarily, the VA Schedule will apply unless there are exceptional or unusual factors which would render application of the schedule impractical.  See Fisher v. Principi, 4 Vet. App. 57, 60 (1993). 

According to the regulation, an extraschedular disability rating is warranted based upon a finding that the case presents such an exceptional or unusual disability picture with such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization that would render impractical the application of the regular schedular standards.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1).

An exceptional case is said to include such factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization as to render impracticable the application of the regular schedular standards.  See Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225, 229 (1993).

Under Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008), there is a three-step inquiry for determining whether a Veteran is entitled to an extraschedular rating.  First, the Board must determine whether the evidence presents such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular evaluations for that service-connected disability are inadequate.

Second, if the schedular evaluation does not contemplate the Veteran's level of disability and symptomatology and is found inadequate, the Board must determine whether the Veteran's disability picture exhibits other related factors such as those provided by the regulation as "governing norms."

Third, if the rating schedule is inadequate to evaluate a Veteran's disability picture and that picture has attendant thereto related factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, then the case must be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service to determine whether, to accord justice, the Veteran's disability picture requires the assignment of an extraschedular rating.

With respect to the first prong of Thun, the evidence of record does not disclose such an exceptional disability picture for which the available schedular evaluations for tinnitus are inadequate.

Upon a May 2023 VA hearing loss and tinnitus examination, a VA audiologist who reviewed the claims file; considered the Veteran's lay accounts; and conducted and appropriate evaluation.  The Veteran reported that tinnitus made him avoid silence.  Otherwise, the Veteran did not report any other symptoms; and the Veteran did not report that tinnitus functionally impaired his daily routines, social interactions, or occupational ability.

With respect to the first prong of Thun, the evidence of record does not reveal such an exceptional disability picture for which the one available schedular evaluation for tinnitus is inadequate.  A comparison between the degree of severity and of the Veteran's tinnitus with the established disability rating criteria (as discussed above) reveals that the disability rating criteria reasonably describe the Veteran's disability level and symptomatology.

Consequently, the schedular rating criteria reasonably describe the Veteran's disability level and symptomatology.

Because the evidence is against the claim for an extraschedular rating for tinnitus, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim on this basis must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C.§ 5107(b); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed Cir. 2001).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the May 2024 rating decision on appeal.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) did not obtain an adequate medical opinion prior to the rating decision on appeal.  Specifically, the Board finds that the January 2024 VA examination to be inadequate as it did not address aggravation.

Secondary service connection is a two-part issue that involves causation and/or aggravation.  See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (holding that secondary service connection is a two-part issue that involves causation and/or aggravation); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (providing that "[a]ny increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the nonservice-connected disease, will be service connected").  The Court had held that a medical opinion that focuses solely on causation is inadequate to address whether a service-connected disability aggravated another condition.  See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013).  Thus, because the VA examiner did not address the second element of secondary service connection, the January 2024 VA examination and opinion report is inadequate for rating purposes.  Accordingly, it necessary to remand the Veteran's claim of service connection for sleep apnea for additional development.  This is so because once VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum VA medical opinion regarding the Veteran's sleep apnea.  Specifically, the examiner must opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that sleep apnea was caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service or service-connected disabilities, to include adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  The examiner must provide a complete rationale for his or her opinion(s) in the examination report.  If any of the above requested opinions cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner must state this and provide a rationale for such conclusion. 

The need for another examination is left to the discretion of the examiner offering the addendum opinion.
