DOCKET NO. 240813-478868
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1805 for a child born with spina bifida are denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Appellant does not have a form or manifestation of spina bifida other than spina bifida occulta.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing benefits under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1805 for a child born with spina bifida have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1116A, 1802, 1805; 38 C.F.R. § 3.814.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from January 1963 to January 1966.  He served in the Republic of Vietnam and was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Purple Heart Medal.  The Veteran died in February 1982.

The Appellant is the Veteran's child.

In March 2024, the Board denied benefits for other covered birth defects and remanded this appeal for issuance of a statement of the case (SOC).  In March 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued a SOC.  In April 2024, the Appellant submitted a Decision Review: Higher-Level Review, VA Form 20-0996 opting into the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) appeals system.  In July 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued a higher-level review rating decision.  In August 2024, the Appellant submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 SOC.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the March 2024 SOC, the Board did not consider it in this decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Appellant would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim, VA Form 20 0995, and submit or identify the evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1805 for spina bifida.

VA will provide certain benefits for an individual with spina bifida whose biological father or mother served in Vietnam.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1802, 1805; 38 C.F.R. § 3.814.  Spina bifida means "any form and manifestation of spina bifida except spina bifida occulta."  38 U.S.C. § 1802; 38 C.F.R. § 3.814(c)(4).  The term "spina bifida" refers to a defective closure of the bony encasement of the spinal cord but does not include other neural tube defects such as encephalocele and anencephaly.  VAOPGCPREC 5-99; but see Jones v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 219 (2002).  Spina bifida is the only birth defect which warrants an award of monetary benefits based on the herbicide agent exposure of a Vietnam veteran who is the father of the child at issue.  See Jones, 16 Vet. App. at 219. 

The term "Vietnam veteran" means a person who performed active military service in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, without regard to the characterization of the person's service.  Service in the Republic of Vietnam includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations, if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.  38 C.F.R. § 3.814(c)(1).  

The Veteran's record indicates that he served in Vietnam.  The Appellant is his biological child conceived after service. 

On a March 2017 VA spina bifida claim form, the Appellant claimed benefits for cervical spine and lumbar spine disabilities and diabetes mellitus.  On an October 2019 spina bifida claim form, the Appellant indicated that he was claiming benefits for several disabilities, including cervical and lumbar spine arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  On an August 2020 VA Form 9, the Appellant stated that he had arthritis of the spine, scoliosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, a thyroid disability, and neuropathy.  In a January 2022 letter, the Appellant again stated that had several disabilities, including arthritis of the spine and rheumatoid arthritis.  In an August 2024 statement, the Appellant reiterated that he was born with scoliosis.  The Appellant did not claim or indicate that he had spina bifida in any of these documents.

At the October 2022 Board hearing, the Appellant stated that he was born with scoliosis and has arthritis of the spine.  He testified that he does not have spina bifida.  

The medical evidence does not indicate that the Appellant has spina bifida.  The record contains private treatment records from many providers, and treatment records obtained from the Social Security Administration (SSA).  The records include spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports and surgical reports.  Although these records indicate treatment for and complaints of spine symptoms, they contain no diagnosis or indication of spina bifida.  The Appellant's diagnoses include arthritis, chronic pain syndrome, spondylolysis, lumbago, and Grade I spondylolisthesis with bilateral foraminal stenosis.  The records indicate that the Appellant underwent spine surgeries.

The Appellant does not have a diagnosis of spina bifida and, therefore, does not meet the criteria for benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1805.  In cases where the Appellant's father is a Vietnam veteran, benefits may be granted only for spina bifida, other than spina bifida occulta.  The law does not provide flexibility in this case.  The law is dispositive of the issue on appeal, and the claim must be denied because of the absence of legal merit or entitlement under the law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
