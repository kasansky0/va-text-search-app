ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, in February 2025, the Veteran submitted a statement requesting to withdraw the appeal of entitlement to service connection for BPPV. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal of entitlement to service connection for BPPV have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his authorized representative.  Id.   

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal of entitlement to service connection for BPPV.  The February 2025 written statement from the Veteran specifically requested this issue be withdrawn.  Therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding this issue.  

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
