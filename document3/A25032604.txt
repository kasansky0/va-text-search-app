DOCKET NO. 240423-435884
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a written statement received in August 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision, the Veteran withdrew his appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty for training (ACDUTRA) from November 1993 to April 1994 and on active duty from January 2003 to August 2003; August 2004 to January 2006; May 2014 to August 2014; August 2017 to March 2018; and June 2018 to June 2019.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in March 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  In April 2024, the Veteran timely appealed such rating decision by submitting a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and requested to a Board hearing before a Veterans Law Judge; however, he withdrew his appeal before a hearing could be scheduled.  

Whether the reduction of the rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from 70 percent to 30 percent as of May 1, 2024, was proper.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  In a written statement received in August 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision, the Veteran withdrew his appeal as to the above captioned issue. In this regard, such statement was in writing, authored by the Veteran, included the correct file number, and explicitly requested that the appeal be withdrawn. Id.; Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).  Therefore, as there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
