ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record favors a finding that the Veteran has a left knee disability that is related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a left knee disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310 (2021). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1992 to February 2017. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service Connection

Laws and Regulations

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain diseases, to include arthritis, may be presumed to have been incurred in service when manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from active duty.  38 U.S.C. § 1112 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309 (2020). 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), an alternative method of establishing the second and third Shedden for certain chronic disabilities such as arthritis is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology.  

In relevant part, 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a) requires that the VA give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" in evaluating a claim to disability or death benefits.  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional."  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2007).  In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis. Id. at 1376-77; see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible.  See Layno, supra (distinguishing between competency ("a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered") and credibility ("a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted"). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), service connection may be granted for disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service- connected disease or injury.  Such permits a grant of service connection not only for disability caused by a service-connected disability, but for the degree of disability resulting from aggravation to a nonservice- connected disability by a service- connected disability. Id.  See also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b). 

In order to prevail on the issue of entitlement to secondary service connection, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran contends that she has instability of her left knee that is secondary to her service-connected right knee disability. 

The Veteran's service treatment records are negative for treatments or complaints of a left knee disability. However, the service treatment records document multiple complaints of right knee pain and right hip pain that increased with the right knee pain.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2016. While specific joint stability testing was negative for instability, there was a reduction in the Veteran's range of motion of her left knee as flexion was from 0 to 110 degrees.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2024. The diagnosis was patellofemoral arthritis of the left knee and a meniscus tear of the left knee. The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's left knee instability disability was proximately due to or caused by the service-connected right knee disability.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's patellofemoral arthritis of the left knee was the same as the patellofemoral arthritis of the right knee with the same severity and were likely caused by the same factors that led to the conditions to develop. The meniscus tear of the left knee was less likely than not caused by the service-connected right knee disability as meniscus tears were typically caused by trauma or degenerative changes in the joint. 

After resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds service connection for a left knee disability is warranted as the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran has a current left knee disability that is related to her service to include as secondary to her service-connected right knee disability. 

Initially, the Board notes that there is a current diagnosis of patellofemoral arthritis of the left knee and a meniscus tear of the left knee. Accordingly, the first element for service connection is established.

However, a veteran seeking disability benefits must establish not only the existence of a disability, but also an etiological connection between his military service and the disability.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); D'Amico v. West, 209 F.3d 1322, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Hibbard v. West, 13 Vet. App. 546, 548 (2000).

As reflected above, the Veteran's service treatment records demonstrate that the Veteran experienced multiple instances of right knee pain but are negative for left knee pain.

Additionally, the Board acknowledges that the July 2024 VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's left knee instability disability was proximately due to or caused by the service-connected right knee disability. 

However, while providing the negative conclusion, the July 2024 VA examiner seemingly limited the negative nexus medical opinion to the instability aspect of the left knee. Notably, on specific examination findings, there was no joint instability of the left knee found. However, the examiner did note that the Veteran had a meniscus tear of her left knee and that the meniscus tear of the left knee was less likely than not caused by the service-connected right knee disability as meniscus tears were typically caused by trauma or degenerative changes in the joint.

As reflected above, while the Veteran had a diagnosis of a meniscus tear of the left knee, she also has a current patellofemoral arthritis of the right and left knee disabilities. 

The Board notes that the scope of a disability claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and any other information of record. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). In this case, although the Veteran filed for service connection for instability of the left knee, a review of her medical treatment records again indicates diagnoses of patellofemoral arthritis of the left knee and a meniscus tear of the left knee. As a result, the Veteran's patellofemoral arthritis of the left knee is also encompassed in the Veteran's service connection claim. 

As reflected above, the July 2024 VA examiner specifically determined that the Veteran's patellofemoral arthritis of the left knee was the same as the patellofemoral arthritis of the right knee with the same severity and were likely caused by the same factors that led to the conditions to develop. Accordingly, despite opining that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's left knee instability disability was proximately due to or caused by the service-connected right knee disability, the examiner effectively provided a positive opinion for the Veteran's patellofemoral arthritis of the left knee disability as it was specifically noted to likely have been caused by the same factors that led to the right knee patellofemoral arthritis disability to develop.

Additionally, there is no competent contrary medical evidence of record that indicates that the Veteran's patellofemoral arthritis of the left knee disability was not caused or aggravated by her service-connected right knee disability.  

Therefore, the positive medical opinions of the July 2024 VA examiner provide the only competent medical opinions as to the relationship between the Veteran's left knee disability and her service-connected right knee disability.

Additionally, a remand for a new VA examination is not necessary because the evidence of record is sufficient to grant the Veteran's claim, and a remand would only serve to unnecessarily delay final adjudication of the claims.  

In sum, for the reasons and bases discussed above, the Board has resolved reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, and service connection for a left knee disability is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b)).
