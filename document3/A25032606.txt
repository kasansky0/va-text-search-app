ORDER

The appeal as to the reinstatement of VA disability benefits prior to March 13, 2024 following a period of incarceration is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) reinstated the Veteran's VA disability benefits from a 10 percent rate to a 60 percent rate, effective March 13, 2024, the date the Veteran first reported his release from incarceration, more than a year after he was released.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date, prior to March 13, 2024, following a period of incarceration for reinstatement of VA disability benefits have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5313; 38 C.F.R. § 3.665(i)(1).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2008 to September 2011.

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

The Board notes that subsequent to the March 2024 decision, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the March 2024 decision.  In April 2024, the AOJ issued a HLR decision, which continued the denial of an earlier effective regarding the resumption of the Veteran's VA disability benefits.  While the Veteran's appeal to the Board is timely to both the March and April 2024 decisions, the Veteran's VA Form 10182 indicates he was appealing the March 2024 decision.  Therefore, the Board finds that the March 2024 decision is on appeal.  See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The appeal as to the reinstatement of VA disability benefits prior to March 13, 2024 following a period of incarceration.

The Veteran contends that he was not informed that he had to inform VA of his release within one year of his release to have his VA disability benefits reinstated.  See April 2024 VA Form 10182; April 2024 HLR informal conference.

The regulations provide that VA benefits shall be resumed the date of release from incarceration if the AOJ receives notice of release within 1 year following release; otherwise, the award shall be resumed the date of receipt of notice of release.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.665(i)(1).

As a matter of background, in June 2021, the Veteran was notified that the AOJ proposed to reduce his monthly rate of disability benefits due to his incarceration in March 2021.  See June 2021 notification letter.  The Veteran was informed that benefits may be resumed upon his release from incarceration effective the date of release only if VA received notice within one year of release, otherwise VA may not pay from any date prior to the month the notice is received if VA does not receive notice within one year of release.  Id.  The Veteran was informed to immediately let the VA know when he was released, paroled, or sent to a halfway house, so that VA could award the full amount of his benefit.  Id.  In August 2024, the AOJ reduced the Veteran's VA disability benefits effective March 29, 2021. 

On March 13, 2024, the Veteran reported that he had been released to home confinement on March 31, 2022 and his sentence ended on January 9, 2023.  See March 2024 statement in support of claim.  The Veteran provided court documents that same day from the New Jersey Probation Office noting the Veteran was incarcerated up until January 9, 2023.  The AOJ confirmed the Veteran that the Veteran was released from FCI-Fairton in New Jersey on January 9, 2023.  See March 2024 report of general information.  

In March 2024, the AOJ reinstated the Veteran's VA disability rate to 60 percent disabling effective March 13, 2024, the date the Veteran first reported his release from incarceration which was more than one year from his actual release date.  See March 2024 notification letter.  

In light of the above, the Board finds that the AOJ properly reinstated the Veteran's VA disability benefits effective March 13, 2024, the date the AOJ first received documentation from an official source that the Veteran was released from incarceration on January 9, 2023.  In June 2021, the Veteran was properly notified that AOJ would resume his benefits the date of release from incarceration if notice of release was received within one year; or that benefits would be resumed the date notice of release was received if received after a year from release.  The Veteran does not contend, nor does the record indicate, the Veteran did not receive the June 2021 notification letter informing him to immediately notify VA of his release from incarceration.  Since the documentation of the Veteran's release was received more than a year after the Veteran's release from incarceration, the Board is bound by the law, and an earlier effective date for the reinstatement of VA disability benefits prior to March 13, 2024, is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.665(i)(1).  Accordingly, the appeal is denied.
