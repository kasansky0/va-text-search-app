ORDER

From February 16, 2021, a 30 percent rating, but no higher, is granted for IBS with GERD. 

FINDING OF FACT

From February 16, 2021, the Veteran's IBS with GERD manifested in diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress, but not in of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

From February 16, 2021, the criteria for a 30 percent rating for IBS with GERD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7139, 7399-7346. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from April 1988 to April 1992. 

This appeal is being adjudicated according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  See 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 169 (Jan. 18, 2019); 38 C.F.R. § 19.2.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Evidentiary Standards

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal.  VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

The law requires the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-29 (2000).  The Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence within the period on appeal and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim. 

Any findings favorable to the Veteran made by the VA Regional Office in notification of a decision are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the finding.  38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  "Findings" means "conclusions on questions of fact and application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue under review."  Id.  

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  

Diagnostic codes are assigned to individual disabilities.  Diagnostic codes provide rating criteria specific to a particular disability.  If two diagnostic codes are applicable to the same disability, the diagnostic code that allows for the higher disability rating applies.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  

From July 16, 2021, a rating in excess of 10 percent for IBS with GERD is

By way of background, the Veteran's claim for service connection for GERD was initially granted in a June 2023 rating decision with a noncompensable rating effective July 16, 2021, under DC 8873-7319.  After requesting Higher Level review, a July 2023 rating decision granted 10 percent for IBS with GERD from July 16, 2021.  This rating was confirmed and continued on Higher Level review in the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  

With regard to co-existing gastrointestinal conditions, VA regulation regulations that there are diseases of the digestive system, particularly within the abdomen, which, while differing in the site of pathology, produce a common disability picture characterized in the main by varying degrees of abdominal distress or pain, anemia, and disturbances in nutrition.  38 C.F.R. § 4.113.  Consequently, certain coexisting diseases in this area do not lend themselves to distinct and separate disability ratings without violating the fundamental principle relating to pyramiding as outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  Rather, a single evaluation will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher rating where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114.  The Board also notes that, with regard to the schedule of ratings of the digestive system, section 4.114 expressly prohibits, in pertinent part, the combination of ratings under Diagnostic Codes 7301 to 7329, inclusive, and 7345 to 7348 inclusive, which include the schedular criteria for IBS under DC 7319.  

Disease of the digestive system, including IBS and GERD, are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, schedule of ratings-digestive system.  The Board notes 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 was amended, effective May 19, 2024, to include a new Diagnostic Code (DC) for GERD, DC 7206.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 19.735 (Mar. 20, 2024).  This rule was made final in March 2024, with an effective date of May 19, 2024, after the review period ended for this matter.  As such, the revised version of the rating criteria is not applicable to this appeal.  Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  As instructed by the preamble, the board will evaluate and rate the Veteran's IBS with GERD under a single disability rating.  

The AOJ rated the Veteran's IBS with GERD using the rating criteria in place at the time of the rating decision.  Prior to the revision to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 in May 2024, there was no specific diagnostic code for GERD.  From July 16, 2021, the Veteran's IBS with GERD was rated by analogy under the DC 7319-7346.  

Diagnostic Code 7319 provides:

	Rating (%)

Irritable colon syndrome (spastic colitis, mucous colitis, etc.):	

Severe; diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress	30

Moderate; frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress	10

Mild; disturbances of bowel function with occasional episodes of abdominal distress	0

[For the maximum 30 percent disability rating, Diagnostic Code 7319 contemplates "severe" IBS. "Severe" IBS is defined as: (1) diarrhea or (2) alternating diarrhea and constipation, with (a) more or less constant abdominal distress.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7319.  "Abdominal distress" is not defined in the diagnostic code or anywhere else of relevance. Absent an express definition, it is presumed that VA regulations employ words using their ordinary dictionary meanings at the time the regulations were promulgated.  See Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 805-06 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  In the medical context, "distress" means "pain or suffering affecting the body, bodily part, or the mind." Distress, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/distress, Medical definition, (last visited April 7, 2025).  In this case, the type of distress is specified; it must be "abdominal" distress. Therefore, "abdominal distress" includes pain or suffering affecting the abdomen and bodily part of the abdomen.] 

Prior to May 19, 2024, GERD was rated by analogy under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.  Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625, 629 (1992); see 38 C.F.R. § 4.20 (providing that unlisted conditions may be rated "under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but [also] the anatomical localization and symptomatology[,] are closely analogous").

Diagnostic Code 7346 provides:

	Rating (%)

Hernia hiatal:	

Symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health	60

Persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health	30

With two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity	10

Diagnostic Code 7346 does not define the terms "considerable impairment of health" and "severe impairment in health." Absent an express definition, it is presumed that VA regulations employ words using their ordinary dictionary meanings at the time the regulations were promulgated. See Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 805-06 (Fed. Cir. 2010). 

An "impairment" from a disease or injury is "any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function." World Health Organization, International classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps: A manual of classification relating to the consequences of disease, May 1976, available at https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/41003 (last visited Apr. 7, 2025). 

The terms "considerable" and "severe" are adjectives that advise of the degree of impairment required to warrant a 30 and 60 percent disability rating, respectively. "Considerable" means "large in extent or degree." Considerable, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/considerable, Definition 2 (last visited Apr. 7, 2025). "Severe" means "very painful or harmful" and "of a great degree." Severe, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe, Definitions 6.b. and 8 (last visited Apr. 7, 2025).

In addition, where the rating criteria are written in the conjunctive, to establish entitlement to a particular rating, a claimant must demonstrate each of the criteria listed in the rating. Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 366 (2007).

As previously explained, ratings for Diagnostic Code 7319 and 7346 may not be combined with each other; rather, a single evaluation will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation. 

VA and private treatment records throughout the appeal period document the Veteran's report of bouts of abdominal urgency worse after the ingestion of food, alternating loose stools with constipation, fecal incontinence, and painful abdominal cramping.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination regarding the severity of his GERD in May 2022.  The VA examiner documented review of the Veteran's VA e-folder in combination with an in-person examination.  The Veteran reported symptoms of heartburn after eating for which he occasionally took Prilosec.  The VA examiner documented that the Veteran had pyrosis.  The Veteran did not have an esophageal stricture, spasm of the esophagus (cardiospasm or achalasia), or an acquired diverticulum of the esophagus.  The Veteran's disability did not impact his ability to work. 

The Veteran was afforded subsequent VA examination regarding the severity of his GERD in February 2023.  The VA examiner documented review of the Veteran's VA e-folder without in-person or telehealth examination.  The VA examiner documented the Veteran's report of heartburn after eating.  The VA examiner documented symptoms that the Veteran had pyrosis.  The Veteran did not have an esophageal stricture, spasm of the esophagus (cardiospasm or achalasia), or an acquired diverticulum of the esophagus.  The Veteran's disability did not impact his ability to work.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination regarding the severity of his IBS in June 2023.  The VA examiner documented review of the Veteran's VA e-folder in combination with an in-person examination.  The VA examiner documented the Veteran's report of alternating constipation and diarrhea with intermittent fecal urgency, nausea, abdominal cramping, sensation of incomplete bowel emptying, excessive gas, constant bloating, frequent fecal leakage, and severe abdominal discomfort 1-2 times per week.  Continuous medication was required for control of the Veteran's disability.  The Veteran did not have surgical treatment for his disability.   The VA examiner documented symptoms of diarrhea, alternating diarrhea and constipation, abdominal distension, intermittent bloating, nausea, flatulence, belching, and abdominal stabbing and cramping.  The Veteran had frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress but did not have weight loss or malnutrition.  The Veteran's disability did not impact his ability to work. 

On careful review, the Board finds that from July 16, 2021, the evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's IBS with GERD manifested in severe symptoms, such as diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress.  The Veteran has consistently reported to private and medical providers that he experienced symptoms of alternating diarrhea and constipation, fecal incontinence and painful abdominal cramping.  While the Veteran is not competent to assign to opine on the appropriate rating for his disability under any particular diagnostic code, he is competent to report the history of his symptoms.  The Board finds the Veteran's statements regarding his symptoms credible and probative.  See generally Fed. R. Evid. 803(4) (statements made for purposes of medical treatment are generally trustworthy); Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 73 (1997) ("[R]ecourse to the [Federal] Rules [of Evidence] is appropriate where they will assist in the articulation of the Board's reasons.")  VA and private treatment records consistently document symptoms consistent with the Veteran's reporting.

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran's GERD manifests in symptoms of pyrosis, but not in symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 

For the foregoing reasons, from July 16, 2021, a rating of 30 percent but no higher for IBS with GERD is granted.
