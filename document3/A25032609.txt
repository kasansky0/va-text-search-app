DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 4, 2023, for the grant of a temporary evaluation of 100 percent based on surgical or other treatment necessitating convalescence is denied.

REMANDED

A rating higher than 30 percent for left knee total replacement as of April 1, 2024, is remanded. 

A compensable rating for left knee scar(s), post total knee replacement is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran underwent left total knee replacement surgery on October 4, 2023, and was awarded a temporary total rating as of that date.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to October 4, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a temporary total disability rating for left total knee replacement are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.29, 4.30.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1989 to February 2002. Her service decorations include the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran wants VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify that evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for a higher rating for her left knee as of April 1, 2024 and associated left knee scar(s), any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

At the outset, the Board notes that in July 2024, the Veteran sought higher level review of an August 2023 rating decision which assessed the ratings assigned to her left knee prior to her October 2023 replacement procedure. The Veteran then filed the August 2024 NOD also seeking review of the August 2023 rating decision. As the Veteran had a pending higher level review of her left knee ratings prior to her total knee replacement, those issues were unable to be appealed to the Board and are not currently on appeal to the Board. A higher-level review rating decision was issued in November 2024 and no appeal of that rating decision has been received by VA. 

Additionally, the August 2024 NOD sought to appeal rating decisions from June 2018, November 2020, February 2022, and July 2022 along with the February 2024 and August 2023 rating decisions, discussed above. As the June 2018, November 2020, February 2022, and July 2022 rating decisions were beyond the one year appeal date, the Board finds that the Veteran's August 2024 NOD as to those rating decisions is untimely.

Thus, as the Board interprets it, the issues on appeal to the Board are the earlier effective date for a temporary total, the assignment of the 30 percent rating for her left knee residuals status post left knee replacement, and the non-compensable rating assigned for her left knee post replacement scars. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 4, 2023, for the grant of a temporary evaluation of 100 percent based on surgical or other treatment necessitating convalescence is denied.

To the extent that the Veteran is seeking an effective date prior to October 4, 2023, for the award of service connection for a temporary total disability rating for left total knee replacement, the Board notes that neither he nor his representative have asserted why such an earlier effective date is warranted.

VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran underwent a left knee replacement on October 4, 2023. As he is granted a temporary total effective from the date of his left knee replacement, there is no theory upon which to award an earlier effective date. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved and to the extent that the Veteran's appeal includes a claim seeking an effective date prior to October 4, 2023, for the award of a temporary total disability rating for left total knee replacement, such claim must be denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

A rating higher than 30 percent for left knee total replacement as of April 1, 2024, is remanded. 

A compensable rating for left knee scar(s), post total knee replacement is remanded.

The record shows that the Veteran underwent a left knee total replacement on October 4, 2023. See October 2023 VA medical center record. Pursuant to the mandates of Diagnostic Code (DC) 5055, a temporary evaluation of 100 percent for the Veteran's left knee was assigned effective October 4, 2023, and continued until April 1, 2024, when a 30 percent rating was assigned. See February 2024 Codesheet. Her left knee scars, post left knee replacement were assigned a noncompensable (0%) rating. 

As a 100 percent rating is the maximum rating allowed, the period from October 4, 2023, until May 31, 2024, is not on appeal to the Board. Thus, the appeal period under the Board's review is as of April 1, 2024. 

In the case of a disability which is temporary in nature such as a period of convalescence following surgery, governing regulation provides for temporary total disability ratings during convalescence. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.30. Temporary total ratings will be assigned from the date of hospital admission and continue for one, two, or three months from the first day of the month following hospital discharge when treatment of a service-connected disability results in: (1) surgery (including outpatient surgery after March 1, 1989) necessitating at least one month of convalescence; (2) surgery with severe post-operative residuals such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps of recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, or the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches (regular weight-bearing prohibited); or (3) immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (a). Extensions of one to three months, beyond the initial three months, may be made under 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (a)(1), (2), or (3). Extensions of one or more months up to six months beyond the initial six months period may be made only under 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (a)(2) or (3) upon the approval of the Veterans Service Center Manager. 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (b).

Moreover, DC 5055 instructs that a minimum 30 percent rating is assigned after a period of convalescence following knee replacement. A 60 percent rating is assigned for knee replacement with chronic residuals consisting of severe painful motion or weakness in the affected extremity. A 60 percent rating is the maximum rating allowed under DC 5055.

Prior to the rating decision on appeal and after her October 2023 procedure, no VA examination was conducted to determine the severity of the Veteran's left knee replacement residuals or whether her left knee scars warranted a compensable rating. This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error which must be corrected on remand.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the current severity of her left knee post replacement residuals, including her left knee scars. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.

All indicated testing should be accomplished and all symptomatology associated with the disability, to include range of motion test results for both active and passive motion, and in weight bearing and non-weight-bearing, and, recording the range of motion in the opposite, undamaged joint.

The examiner must address range of motion loss specifically due to pain and any functional loss during flare-ups. The examiner is to express an opinion on whether pain could significantly limit functional ability during flare-ups or when the joint is used repeatedly over a period of time. These determinations should, if feasible, be portrayed in terms of degrees of additional range of motion loss due to pain on use or during flare-ups. 

If a flare-up is not elicited during the examination, estimate the degrees of range of motion during flare-ups and include this in the examination report. If such estimation is not possible without resort to speculation, examiners must give an explanation as to why beyond merely noting that objective examination in such conditions has not been performed. In such a case there is necessarily a lack of objective testing and observation, and an estimation therefore must be based on statements by the Veteran or other treatment records. If such an estimation is impossible, it must be clear that the impossibility is predicated on a lack of knowledge among the medical community at large and not the insufficient knowledge of the specific examiner.

The examiner must specifically address the Veteran's left knee post-replacement residuals and determine if she has severe painful motion OR weakness in the affected extremity. To the extent possible, the examiner should report any of the following that existed as of April 1, 2024, forward: any additional surgery to the left knee, incompletely healed surgical wounds of the left knee, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, or the necessity for house confinement, the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches (regular weight-bearing prohibited), or immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more.

Additionally, the examiner is asked to determine the severity of the left knee scars associated with the Veteran's left knee replacement. The examiner is asked to determine the number of scars associated with the October 2023 surgery and provide a full description scars, including the length, width, and if the scars are unstable and/or painful.

The Veteran's statements regarding her symptomology should be recorded and considered.
