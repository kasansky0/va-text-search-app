Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran has not been shown to have tinnitus that manifested in service or to a compensable degree within one year thereafter or that is otherwise related to his military service. 

2.  The Veteran has not been shown to have left ear hearing loss since he filed his claim or within close proximity thereto.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  Tinnitus was not incurred in active service and may not be presumed to have been so incurred. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2.  Left ear hearing loss was not incurred in active service and may not be presumed to have been so incurred. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1979 to January 1980.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from March 2024 rating decisions.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in October 2024 and elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the issues of entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss and PTSD, any evidence that the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that an issue on appeal was characterized by the AOJ as entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  However, in light of the Veteran's assertions and the evidence of record, the Board has recharacterized the issue more broadly to include any acquired psychiatric disorder. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5-6, 8 (2009).

Law and Analysis

The Veteran and his representative have not raised any issues with the pre-decisional duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issues decided herein. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease. Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  As organic diseases of the nervous system, including tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss, are considered to be a chronic disease for VA compensation purposes, if chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013) and Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015) (adding tinnitus as an "organic disease of the nervous system" to the list of disabilities explicitly recognized as "chronic" in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a)).

In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including organic diseases of the nervous system, are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Tinnitus

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran's service treatment records are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of tinnitus.  Neither tinnitus nor manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity are shown during the Veteran's military service.  The pertinent regulations require that manifestations are "noted" in the service records and that is not the case in this instance.  Therefore, while currently diagnosed tinnitus is a chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), no notations of the disease or any characteristic manifestations of tinnitus were shown in the service records.  As such, service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) is not warranted, and tinnitus may not be presumed to have been incurred in service. 38 U.S.C. § 1101; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Moreover, the most competent, credible, and probative evidence does not show that the Veteran had tinnitus that manifested within one year of his military service. Indeed, there is no documentation of the disorder for many years thereafter.  

The Board does acknowledge the Veteran's statements that his tinnitus began in service. See March 2023 VA 21-526EZ.  Although lay persons are generally not competent to offer evidence which requires medical knowledge, they may provide competent testimony as to visible symptoms and manifestations of a disorder. Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137 (1994); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); Buchanan v. Nicolson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  A veteran can attest to factual matters of which he has or had first-hand knowledge, e.g., experiencing pain in service, reporting to sick call, being placed on limited duty, and undergoing physical therapy. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). Indeed, the Court has held that tinnitus is a condition is capable of lay observation. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).

The Federal Circuit has held that lay evidence is one type of evidence that must be considered, if submitted, when a veteran seeks disability benefits, and competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself for proving the existence of a chronic disease. See Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1335; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a), 3.307(b).  The Board, however, retains the discretion to make credibility determinations and otherwise weigh the evidence submitted, including lay evidence. Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1336.  Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994) (distinguishing between competency ("a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered") and credibility ("a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted")); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).

In this case, the Board finds that the Veteran is competent to state that he has had tinnitus since his military service.  However, the Board also notes that he has made inconsistent statements regarding the onset of the disorder.  In this regard, the Veteran told the March 2023 examiner that his tinnitus had its onset in October 1979 and that it has been constant and worsening since that time.  On the other hand, December 2020 and October 2022 private treatment records show that he denied having tinnitus.  Thus, his own statements to his private health care providers suggest that the disorder has not been present and continuous since service.

For these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's reported history regarding the onset of his tinnitus is unreliable and not credible.

In addition to the lack of evidence showing that tinnitus manifested in service or within close proximity thereto, the weight of the evidence of record does not relate the disorder to the Veteran's military service.

A March 2023 initially opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was at least as likely as not caused by or a result of military noise exposure.  She relied on a finding of excessive noise exposure in service and the Veteran's report that the disorder began in service.  However, in an addendum provide later that month, the same examiner noted that was no report of tinnitus in his service treatment records or until the time of the claim and that the Veteran had denied having tinnitus in October 2022.  Therefore, she instead concluded that it is less likely than not that the disorder is a result of military noise exposure.  In other words, the examiner clarified her opinion following further review of the evidence, and the Board notes that the latter opinion was based on a complete and accurate factual premise as opposed to her initial opinion. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that a medical opinion based upon an incomplete or inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).

There is no medical opinion otherwise showing that the Veteran's current tinnitus is related to his military service.

The Board has also considered the Veteran's lay statements indicating that his current tinnitus is related to his military service.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), as to the specific issue in this case, the etiology of his current tinnitus falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person, particularly in light of the delayed onset. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Moreover, even assuming that the Veteran is competent to provide such an opinion, the Board finds that the March 2023 VA examiner's addendum opinion is more probative, as it was provided by medical professional with knowledge, training, and expertise and is supported by a complete rationale based on such knowledge. The examiner also reviewed the claims file and considered the Veteran's reported history and medical literature.

Based on the foregoing, the weight of the competent, credible, and probative evidence does not persuasively show that the Veteran has current tinnitus that manifested in service or within one year thereafter or that is otherwise causally related thereto.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted for tinnitus.

Left Ear Hearing Loss

For the purpose of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board find that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for left ear hearing loss.

The Veteran's service treatment records are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of left ear hearing loss.  

Moreover, the Veteran has not been shown to have left ear hearing loss for VA purposes at any point during the appeal period or within close proximity thereto as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  In fact, a March 2023 VA examination revealed puretone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	 25	35	25	25	35

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 94 percent in the left ear. Such findings do not show that the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; that the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or that speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  

There is also no other evidence showing that the Veteran meets the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Moreover, an October 2022 private medical record indicates that he did not feel that he had a history of hearing loss at that time. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reported history of noise exposure. However, the evidence of record does not establish the existence of left ear hearing loss under the clear requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  In Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 174, 178-80 (2007), the Court specifically upheld the validity of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 to define hearing loss for VA compensation purposes.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  Evidence must show that the Veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed.

Because the evidence does not show that the Veteran has left ear hearing loss as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted, and discussion of the remaining elements is not necessary. See Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006) (the absence of any one element will result in denial of service connection). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Upon review, the Board finds that additional development is needed to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors for the remaining issues on appeal.

Right Ear Hearing Loss

A March 2023 VA examination found that the Veteran has right ear hearing loss as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, but the examiner opined that the disorder is not at least as likely as not caused by or a result of an event in military service.  She noted that the Veteran served on active duty for only six months and stated that it is unlikely that an individual would suffer significant hearing loss from noise exposure for a short duration of time.  The examiner referenced literature that had found that the amount of time in service was the most important contributing factor to the incidence of hearing loss.  She noted that members of the infantry typically do not develop hearing loss until serving more than seven and a half years and that member of armor units do not develop hearing loss until serving more than twelve and a half years. 

Nevertheless, the Board notes that the examiner relied solely on the Veteran's length of service.  She did not provide any other rationale or discussion of the relevant facts in this case.  Therefore, the Board finds that an additional medical opinion is needed to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right ear hearing loss.

Acquired Psychiatric Disorder

The Board notes that the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  He has claimed that he developed a psychiatric disorder due to an event that occurred during basic training, which led to him go absent without leave (AWOL).  His military personnel records show that he was discharged from service because he went AWOL.  Therefore, the Board finds that a VA examination and medical opinion were needed to determine the nature and etiology of any acquired psychiatric disorder that may be present.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) should obtain a medical opinion to determine the etiology of the Veteran's right ear hearing loss. A physical examination is only needed if one is deemed necessary by the individual providing the opinion.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file.

The examiner should note that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should state this with a fully reasoned explanation.

The examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran has right ear hearing loss that is causally or etiologically related to his military service, including noise exposure therein.

In rendering the opinion, the examiner should discuss medically known or theoretical causes of hearing loss and describe how hearing loss which results from noise exposure generally presents or develops in most cases, as distinguished from how hearing loss develops from other causes, in determining the likelihood that current hearing loss was caused by noise exposure or injury in service as opposed to some other causes.

A clear rationale for all opinions should be provided.

2.  The Veteran should be afforded a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, that may be present. Any studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file.

The examiner should note that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should state this with a fully reasoned explanation.

The examiner should identify all current psychiatric disorders. If any previously disorder is not found on examination, the examiner should address whether it was misdiagnosed or has resolved.

For each diagnosis identified other than PTSD, the examiner should provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the disorder is causally or etiologically related to the Veteran's military service, to include any symptomatology or events therein.  

Regarding PTSD, the AOJ should provide the examiner with a summary of any verified in-service stressors, and the examiner must be instructed that only these events may be considered for the purpose of determining whether exposure to an in-service stressor has resulted in PTSD.

The examiner should determine whether the diagnostic criteria to support the diagnosis of PTSD have been satisfied. If the PTSD diagnosis is deemed appropriate, the examiner should then comment upon the link between the current symptomatology and any verified in-service stressor.

A clear rationale for all opinions should be provided.
