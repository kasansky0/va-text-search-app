DOCKET NO. 240321-424627
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired mental health disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety (claimed as mental health disease), is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired mental health disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety (claimed as mental health disease), was erroneously docketed while the Veteran's request for Higher-Level Review was pending, resulting in an impermissible concurrent election.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of this appeal as to the claim of service connection for service connection for an acquired mental health disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety (claimed as mental health disease), are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1975 to April 1975 and from March 1980 to November 1981.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 26, 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  In the December 26, 2023 decision, the RO denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for mental health disease.  The RO also readjudicated and denied a claim for entitlement to service connection for hearing loss, secondary to PTSD in a December 29, 2023 rating decision, with notification sent on January 2 and 3, 2024.

In January 2024, the Veteran requested a higher-level-review of the December 26 and December 29, 2023 rating decisions.  While the higher-level review was pending at the AOJ, the Veteran also attempted to appeal those determinations to the Board.  In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Direct Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  He selected the Hearing docket.  However, in June and July 2024, the Veteran submitted additional VA Form 10182s, appealing only the issue of entitlement to service connection for mental health disease.  He requested direct review.  In an October 2024 letter, the Board informed the Veteran that it had received his June and July 2024 requests to change his review option for the issue of entitlement to service connection for mental health received in March 2024, and his appeal had been placed on the direct review docket.  The Board also informed the Veteran that because he did not request to change the Board review option for the issue of entitlement to service connection for hearing loss, that issue would remain on the hearing docket. See October 2024 BVA Letter.  As such, the issue of entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is placed on a different docket at the Board than the instant appeal and will be the subject of a separate Board decision issued at a later date.

The Veteran was not scheduled for a Board hearing after it was discovered that the appeal was improperly docketed as a concurrent election.  Moreover, in a May 2024 higher-level review rating decision, the AOJ addressed the Veteran's claim for service connection for mental health disease pursuant to the January 2024 higher-level review request.  

For the reasons stated below, the appeal from the December 26, 2023 rating decision must be dismissed as a matter of law.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework, there are three administrative review options following an AOJ decision on a claim: (1) Higher-Level Review, (2) Supplemental Claim, and (3) Board Appeal.  If a request for review of a decision, such as the Veteran's claims, under one of these three administrative review options lanes is pending final adjudication, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(d),(e), 20.205.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited.  See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).  The Court held that a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the one-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option. Terry, 37 Vet. App. at 2-3.  This holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple administrative review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); Id.  Accordingly, the Court makes it clear that only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues. Id.

On December 26, 2023, the AOJ denied service connection for mental health disease.  In January 2024, the Veteran requested a higher-level review of that determination, as noted above

As there was a January 2024 request for Higher-Level Review pending at the time the RO received the Veteran's March 2024 VA Form 10182, the March 2024 VA Form 10182 was a prohibited concurrent election, and should not have been docketed at the Board while the higher-level review request remained pending.  Furthermore, there is no indication that the Veteran withdrew the higher-level review request, and as noted above, the AOJ issued the May 2024 in response to the request for higher-level review.  Accordingly, the Board's docketing of this prohibited concurrent election was erroneous. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  

In Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021), the Court held that, where a claimant appeals a decision governed by the legacy review system by filing a VA Form 10182, and it is improperly docketed at the Board under the AMA, the Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  Nonetheless as stated by the Court in Hall, the Board may dismiss such cases due to procedural defects, such as noncompliance with claims processing rules.

In this case, there is a clear procedural defect with regard to claims processing rules because there was an impermissible concurrent election of Higher-Level Review and Board appeal options. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  As such, the March 21, 2024 appeal to the Board as to the claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired mental health disability, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety (claimed as mental health disease), must be dismissed as a matter of law.
