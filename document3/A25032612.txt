REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 3, 1981, to February 16, 1987, from January 21, 1991, to June 29, 1991, and from October 19, 2002, to November 2, 2002. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 13, 2023, for an award of service connection for a low back disability

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 13, 2023, for an award of service connection for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) secondary to a low back disability

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 13, 2023, for an award of service connection for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (femoral nerve) secondary to a low back disability

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 13, 2023, for an award of service connection for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) secondary to a low back disability

5. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 13, 2023, for an award of service connection for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity (femoral nerve) secondary to a low back disability

The effective date for the award of service connection for a disease or injury is the day following separation from active duty, or the date entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. The effective date of an award based on a claim reopened after final adjudication shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.?38?U.S.C. §?5110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.400.? 

By way of background, the Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for a low back disability and for disabilities of the bilateral lower extremities, characterized as "DDD Mid-Lower Back w/ surg...R - Lower Ext SEC DDD Back...L-Lower Ext SEC DDD Back..." in July 2018. Those claims were denied in an October 2018 rating decision. Following issuance of that decision, the Veteran timely filed a September 2019 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) appearing to appeal only the claims for service connection for disabilities of the lower extremity, the NOD referencing only "bilateral radiculopathy (sic)," with no mention of a lower back condition. 

The Veteran's appeal for service connection for disabilities of the bilateral lower extremities, characterized as bilateral radiculopathy, was denied by the Board in a November 2023 decision. The Veteran appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) which, pursuant to a Joint Motion for Partial Remand, vacated the Board decision and returned the matter to the Board on the basis that in denying the claims for service connection for bilateral radiculopathies of the lower extremities, the Board failed to explain why a "sympathetic reading" of the Veteran's September 2019 NOD would not have indicated the Veteran intended also to appeal the issue of service connection claim for a low back disability. Indeed, while the NOD on its face does not mention a low back condition, the Veteran has consistently theorized his radiculopathies as secondary to a low back disability. 

In a separate appeal stream, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim in December 2023, following issuance of the Board decision, without appending or citing to new and relevant evidence, seeking service connection for disabilities of the low back and bilateral lower extremities. Those claims were granted in an April 2024 rating decision, which assigned effective dates of December 13, 2023 for each of service connection for the low back, and radiculopathies of the bilateral lower extremities (sciatic nerve), and radiculopathies of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral nerve). 

The instant appeal seeks an earlier effective date (prior to December 13, 2023) for the awards of service connection for those disabilities, on the basis that a "sympathetic reading," of the Veteran's September 2019 NOD would indicate he has been in pursuit of service connection for a low back disability, and radiculopathies on a secondary basis, since that time, and thus the date of his initial claim, received July 17, 2018, is the proper effective date for these disabilities.

While sympathetic to the Veteran's position, the Board disagrees, and finds that the correct effective date was assigned for disabilities of the low back and bilateral lower extremities. Critically, the application of effective dates is mechanical, and the Board is not at liberty to grant equitable relief in cases such as the instant one. The grant of service connection issues from the Veteran's supplemental claim, filed in December 13, 2023, following the Board's denial of the various service connection claims as detailed above, and over a year following any final adjudication of the claim for service connection for a low back condition. The December 2023 claim did not cite to or append new and relevant evidence or seek readjudication of any prior denial. As such, the Board regards December 13, 2023 as the date of claim in this case. Therefore, even allowing that entitlement to the benefits sought arose prior to that date, the date of claim represents the latter of the two relevant dates and is thus the earliest available effective date for the awards of service connection for the disabilities herein at issue. On that basis, the claims for earlier effective dates for disability of the low back and associated radiculopathies of the bilateral lower extremities must be denied.
