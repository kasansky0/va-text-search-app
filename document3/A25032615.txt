ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 17, 2022, for the award of a 40 percent evaluation for the Veteran's chronic fatigue (claimed as chronic fatigue syndrome) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In August 2014, the Veteran filed a claim for numerous disabilities for which he was seeking service connection, none of which included fatigue.  

2. During a February 2015 Gulf War Medical Examination, the Veteran reported that he was "tired and wiped out all the time," but the examiner did not diagnosis the Veteran with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).  

3. In April 2015, the Regional Office (RO) denied service connection for fatigue due to gulf war environmental hazard on the basis that there was no diagnosis of CFS, and the Veteran's fatigue was not a chronic multi-symptom illness, a symptom of a chronic multi-symptom illness, or related to any specific exposure event during the Veteran's service in Southwest Asia; this decision became final as the Veteran did not request higher level review of the decision, did not submit a Supplemental Claim with new and material evidence nor appeal the decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) within one year from the date of the mailing of the April 2015 decision.     

4.  In May 2017, the Veteran filed a claim for combat fatigue as secondary to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gulf war environmental hazard.  

5. In March 2018, the Veteran was denied service connection for fatigue due to gulf war environmental hazard (now claimed as combat fatigue due to OSA) because the Veteran did not submit any new and material evidence with his May 2017 claim; this decision became final as the Veteran did not request higher level review of the decision, did not submit a Supplemental Claim with new and material evidence nor appeal the decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) within one year from the date of the mailing of the March 2018 decision.  

6. In October 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (SCA) which was rejected by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in November 2021, as the SCA was not accompanied with new and relevant evidence.

7. In November 2022, the Veteran filed another VA Form 20-0995 SCA along with new and relevant evidence.  

8. In April 2023 the RO denied service connection for CFS on the basis that the evidence did not show a current diagnosed disability.  

9. In May 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review of the April 2023 decision, and in August 2023, the RO granted service connection for the Veteran's chronic fatigue with an evaluation of 40 percent effective November 17, 2022, the day the Veteran submitted his VA Form 20-0995 SCA along with new and relevant evidence.     

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish an effective date earlier than November 17, 2022, for the award of a 40 percent evaluation for CFS have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.88b, Diagnostic Code 6354.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1984 to July 1987 and from December 1990 to April 1991, to include in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations.  

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from an April 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision and an August 2023 higher level review by a VA RO, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), that granted service connection for chronic fatigue with an evaluation of 40 percent effective November 17, 2022, the date the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 SCA was received by the AOJ.  

In June 2024, the Veteran initiated this appeal to the Board with the filing of a Decision Review Request (VA Form 10182), requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge of the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 rating decision.? In?a July 2024 correspondence, the Board acknowledged the appeal and informed the Veteran and his representative that the appeal had been placed on the Board's direct review docket.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's rating decision on appeal, here as of April 20, 2023, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.? 38?C.F.R. §?20.301.? If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it herein.? 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.? 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. §?3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Preliminary Matter 

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

Effective Date Laws and Regulations

The statutory guidelines for the determination of an effective date for an award of disability compensation are set forth in?38 U.S.C. §?5110.  Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.? 38 C.F.R. §?3.400. 

Rating?decisions?are?final, and binding based on evidence on file at the time the claimant is notified of the decision and may not be revised on the same factual basis except by a duly constituted appellate authority.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(a).  The claimant has one year from notification of a RO decision to initiate an appeal by filing a notice of disagreement with the?decision, and the?decision?becomes?final?if an appeal is not perfected within the allowed time.? 38 U.S.C. §?7105;?38 C.F.R. §§?3.160, 20.201, 20.1103. 

VA may reopen a claim that has been previously denied if new and relevant evidence is submitted by or on behalf of the claimant.? 38 C.F.R. §?3.2501. 

The effective date based on the submission of new and relevant evidence received after a final disallowance is the date of the receipt of the new claim.? 38 U.S.C. §?5110(a);?38 C.F.R. §?3.2501. 

An application that had been previously denied cannot preserve an effective date for a later grant of benefits based on a new application.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.400?(q); see Wright v. Gober,?10?Vet. App.?343, 346-47?(1997); see also Washington v. Gober,?10?Vet. App.?391, 393?(1997) ("The fact that the appellant had previously submitted claim applications, which had been denied, is not relevant to the assignment of an effective date based on a current application."). 

It is settled law that the effective date for the grant of service connection following a final decision is the date of the reopened claim.  See Sears v. Principi,?16?Vet. App.?244, 248?(2002) ("the Court thus holds that the effective date statute,?38 U.S.C. §?5110(a), is clear on its face with respect to granting an effective date for an award of VA periodic monthly benefits no earlier than the date that the claim for reopening was filed").  In the Sears case, the Court explained that the statutory framework did not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits that is predicated upon a reopened claim.  The Court explained that the term, new claim, as it appeared in?38 C.F.R. §?3.400(q), means a claim to reopen a previously and finally decided claim. 

Thus, the effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the earliest medical evidence showing a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA.  See Lalonde v. West, 12?Vet. App.?377, 382 (1999). 

Moreover, under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued.?38 C.F.R. § 3.2500?(c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500?(h).  For decisions rendered after a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182.? Id.? 

After a rating decision becomes final, an earlier effective date may be established only by a request for revision of that decision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  See Rudd v. Nicholson,?20?Vet. App.?296 (2006).  Free-standing earlier effective date claims that could be raised at any time are impermissible because such claims would vitiate decision finality.? Id.? 

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in "approximate" (meaning nearly equal), with a claimant prevailing in either event.?38 U.S.C. §?5107(b);?38 C.F.R. §?3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi,?274 F.3d 1361?(Fed. Cir. 2001). If the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, the claim is denied. 

Analysis

The August 2023 rating decision on appeal granted service-connection for the Veteran's chronic fatigue with an evaluation of 40 percent effective November 17, 2022.  In the June 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran's attorney sought an effective date of August 11, 2014, the day the Veteran was granted service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and OSA.  The attorney argued that the Veteran's claim of chronic fatigue had been continuously pursued and that since the Veteran's chronic fatigue was granted as secondary to his service-connected PTSD and OSA, the effective date for the Veteran's chronic fatigue should be August 11, 2014.  The relevant procedural history is as follows.     

In August 2014, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526 Application for Compensation or Pension for numerous disabilities for which he was seeking service connection, none of which included fatigue.  During a February 2015 Gulf War Medical Exam, the Veteran reported that he was "tired and wiped out all the time," but the examiner did not diagnosis the Veteran with CFS.  In April 2015, the RO denied service connection for fatigue due to gulf war environmental hazard on the basis that there was no diagnosis of CFS, and the Veteran's fatigue was not a chronic multi-symptom illness, a symptom of a chronic multi-symptom illness, or related to any specific exposure event during the Veteran's service in Southwest Asia.  The April 2015 decision became final as the Veteran did not file a VA Form 0995 SCA, VA Form 0996 HLR, or a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement within one year from the date of the mailing of the April 2015 decision, which here was April 6, 2015.

In May 2017, more than a year after the April 2015 decision denying the Veteran service connection for his fatigue, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking service connection for combat fatigue as secondary to his OSA and gulf war environmental hazard.  In March 2018, the Veteran was denied service connection for fatigue due to gulf war environmental hazard (now claimed as combat fatigue due to OSA) because the Veteran did not submit any new and material evidence with his May 2017 claim.  The March 2018 decision also became final, as the Veteran did not file a VA Form 0995 SCA, VA Form 0996 HLR, or a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement within one year from the date of the mailing of the March 2018 decision, which here was March 5, 2018.  

In October 2021, more than a year after the March 2018 decision denying the Veteran service connection for fatigue, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 SCA which was rejected by the VA in November 2021, as the SCA was not accompanied with new and relevant evidence.  See November 2011 Correspondence.  In November 2022, the Veteran filed another VA Form 20-0995 SCA along with new and relevant evidence.  In April 2023 the RO denied service connection for CFS on the basis that the evidence did not show a current diagnosed disability.  In May 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 HLR of the April 2023 decision, and in August 2023, the RO granted service connection for the Veteran's chronic fatigue with an evaluation of 40 percent effective November 17, 2022, the day the Veteran submitted his VA Form 20-0995 SCA that was accompanied by new and relevant evidence.     

After having carefully reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence supports entitlement to an effective date of November 17, 2022, the day VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 SCA, and not earlier.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q). 

As noted above, the effective date based on the submission of new and relevant evidence received after a final disallowance is the date of the receipt of the new claim.? 38 U.S.C. §?5110?(a);?38 C.F.R. §?3.2051.  As VA received the Veteran's supplemental claim along with new and relevant evidence on November 17, 2022, that date is the proper effective date for service connection for chronic fatigue.  

However, the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date earlier than November 17, 2022.  Following the March 2018 Board decision which became final, there is no evidence the Veteran filed any formal or informal claim for VA compensation benefits until October 2021, which was rejected due to a lack of new and relevant evidence regarding the Veteran's chronic fatigue.  Thereafter, the only claim for compensation benefits for chronic fatigue that was filed was on November 17, 2022.  

Therefore, entitlement to an earlier effective date for the Veteran's service-connected chronic fatigue is not warranted.? As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an earlier effective date, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied.? 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§?4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.?  

The Board observes that the Veteran contends that he has continuously pursued his claim for chronic fatigue since April 11, 2014, and that since he was service-connected for his PTSD and OSA as of April 11, 2014, because he was service-connected for chronic fatigue as secondary to his PTSD and OSA, the effective date for service connection for chronic fatigue should also be April 11, 2014.  See May 2024 VA Form 10182.  As explained above, however, the Veteran has not continuously pursued his chronic fatigue claim since 2014.  In fact, both the April 2015 and March 2018 decisions regarding service connection for chronic fatigue became final, as the Veteran did not file a VA Form 0995 SCA, VA Form 0996 HLR, or a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement within one year from the date of the mailing of those decisions.  See Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96 (2024) (holding that the finality of an AMA benefits determination is "forestalled" when a claim is continuously pursued - either be a filing of a 10182 within a year of the RO decision or by filing a supplemental claim within a year after the decision by the Board or the Court).  Additionally, when a claim for service connection for a disability is filed that is secondary to an already service-connected disability, the effective date for the secondary disability is the date VA receives the claim for secondary service connection, not the effective date of the primary service-connected disability.  See Lalonde, 12?Vet. App. at 382.  Thus, the Board gives no weight to the Veteran's argument.          

Finally, the Board notes that neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin,?28?Vet. App.?366, 69-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record). 

Accordingly, the appeal is denied.?
