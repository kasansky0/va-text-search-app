Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for right (major) shoulder impingement, status post subacromial decompression, arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, and rotator cuff repair with degenerative arthritis, since September 12, 2024, on an accrued basis is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's migraines, including migraine variants, were proximately due to and/or aggravated beyond its normal progression by his service-connected disabilities.

2. During his June 28, 2010, Board hearing, the Veteran presented informal claims seeking increased evaluations for his low back disability and right lower extremity radiculopathy; and to reopen his claim of entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability. 

3. An increase in the severity of the Veteran's service-connected low back strain with degenerative disc disease was not factually ascertainable prior to April 6, 2022.

4. Prior to July 27, 2023, it was not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's left shoulder disability was incurred in or aggravated by his military service.

5. Throughout the course of this appeal, the Veteran's low back strain with degenerative disc disease had not been shown to have resulted in unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

6. Since the initial grant of service connection, the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy was manifested by no more than mild incomplete paralysis.

7. Since the initial grant of service connection, the Veteran's left (minor) shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear was manifested by a range of motion, including after repetitive use over time, consisting of flexion and abduction to no less than 60 degrees, and internal and external rotation to no less than 40 degrees; pain on motion; pain on weight bearing and nonweight-bearing; crepitus; localized tenderness or pain on palpation; no muscle atrophy; no instability; no residuals of recurrent dislocation; no humerus impairments; and complaints of pain and limited motion.

8. The combined effects of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1979 to March 1983 and from September 1987 to February 1997.  He died in January 2025.  The appellant is his surviving spouse, and she was granted substitution to pursue the Veteran's claims in March 2025.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from August 2024, September 2024, and October 2024 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

A. Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches, including secondary to service-connected disabilities, on an accrued basis.

B. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 6, 2022, for the award of an increased evaluation of 40 percent for low back strain with degenerative disc disease on an accrued basis. 

C. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 6, 2022, for the award of an increased evaluation of 20 percent for right shoulder impingement, status post subacromial decompression, arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, and rotator cuff repair with degenerative arthritis, on an accrued basis. 

In May 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 decision.  In August 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which denied service connection for migraine headaches; confirmed the grant of an increased evaluation of 40 percent for Veteran's low back disability, effective April 6, 2022; and confirmed the grant of an increased evaluation of 20 percent for his right shoulder disability, effective April 6, 2022.  In adjudicating these issues, the AOJ considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2023 decision.  

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran contested the denial of service connection for migraine headaches, along with the evaluations and effective dates assigned to his low back and right shoulder disabilities.  The Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant, Veteran, or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

D. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for low back strain with degenerative disc disease.

As noted above, the AOJ's August 2024 HLR decision on appeal confirmed the grant of an increased evaluation of 40 percent for low back strain with degenerative disc disease, effective April 6, 2022.  Following receipt of additional evidence, the AOJ issued a September 2024 rating decision which confirmed and continued the assigned 40 percent evaluation for the Veteran's low back disability.  

The Veteran's October 2024 Notice of Disagreement contested both the August 2024 HLR decision and the September 2024 rating decision.  Having selected the Evidence Submission docket, the Board shall adjudicate the issue of an increased evaluation of 40 percent for low back strain with degenerative disc disease with consideration of the evidence of record up until the September 2024 rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant, Veteran, or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

E. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for right (major) shoulder impingement, status post subacromial decompression, arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, and rotator cuff repair with degenerative arthritis, from April 6, 2022, to September 12, 2024.

F. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for right (major) shoulder impingement, status post subacromial decompression, arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, and rotator cuff repair with degenerative arthritis, after September 12, 2024.

As noted above, the AOJ's August 2024 HLR decision on appeal denied an increased evaluation in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's right shoulder disability.  Following receipt of additional evidence, the AOJ issued a September 2024 rating decision which granted an increased evaluation of 30 percent for the Veteran's right shoulder disability, effective September 12, 2024.  

In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, HLR, requesting review of the effective date assigned to increased evaluation of 30 percent assigned to the Veteran's right shoulder disability.  In October 2024, AOJ issued an HLR decision, which effectively denied increased evaluations for the Veteran's right shoulder disability, both prior to and since September 12, 2024.  The October 2024 HLR decision was based upon evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2024 rating decision.  

The Veteran's October 2024 Notice of Disagreement contested the staged disability evaluations assigned to the Veteran's right shoulder disability by the AOJ's August 2024 and October 2024 HLR decisions.  The October 2024 HLR decision considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2024 decision.  Having selected the Evidence Submission docket, the Board shall adjudicate whether an increased evaluation for the Veteran's right shoulder disability is warranted both prior to and since September 12, 2024, with consideration of the evidence of record up until the September 2024 rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant, Veteran, or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

G. Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy.

The AOJ's August 2024 rating decision, in pertinent part, granted service connection at an initial evaluation of 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy, effective April 6, 2022.

The Veteran's October 2024 NOD contested the initial evaluation assigned to the left lower extremity radiculopathy.  The Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, as to this issue, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant, Veteran, or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

H. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 27, 2023, for the award of service connection for left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear.

I. Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear.

In February 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision granting service connection at an initial evaluation of 20 percent for left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear, effective July 27, 2023.  The Veteran's October 2024 NOD contested the assigned initial evaluation and effective date for this award.  The Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

As for the effective date of service connection for this award, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant, Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

As for the initial disability evaluation assigned to this condition, the AOJ received additional evidence and issued a September 2024 rating decision which continued the denial of an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's left shoulder disability.  The Veteran's October 2024 NOD contested both the August 2024 and September 2024 rating decisions.  Thus, as to the initial evaluation issue, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant, Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

J. Entitlement to a TDIU.

The AOJ's September 2024 rating decision denied entitlement to a TDIU.  The Veteran's October 2024 NOD contested this decision; and elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant, Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

K. Remanded Issues

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

As the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to an effective date prior to  April 6, 2022, for the award of an increased evaluation of 20 percent for right shoulder impingement, status post subacromial decompression, arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, and rotator cuff repair with degenerative arthritis; and entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent prior to, and 40 percent after September 12, 2024, for right (major) shoulder impingement, status post subacromial decompression, arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, and rotator cuff repair with degenerative arthritis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

L.  Williams Waiver Received.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2), an appellant may modify a NOD to change the Board docket being requested.  The time limit for such modification is "within one year from the date that the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the NOD, whichever is later." See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2).  "[T]he Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up." See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  In this case, however, the Veteran submitted a Williams waiver form along with the NOD.  Thus, the Board finds the appellant is not prejudiced by having the claim adjudicated now.

1. Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches.

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Evidence of continuity of symptomatology from the time of service until the present is required where the chronicity of a chronic condition manifested during service either has not been established or might reasonably be questioned.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2013) (holding that only conditions listed as chronic diseases in § 3.309(a) may be considered for service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

Service connection may also be established for disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Further, a disability that is aggravated by a service-connected disability may be service connected to the degree that the aggravation is shown. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).  However, VA will not concede that a nonservice-connected disease or injury was aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury unless the baseline level of severity of the nonservice-connected disease or injury is established by medical evidence created before the onset of aggravation or by the earliest medical evidence created at any time between the onset of aggravation and the receipt of medical evidence establishing the current level of severity of the nonservice-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The proper standard in an aggravation inquiry for service-connected disease or injury is not whether there was permanent worsening but rather any increase in disability. Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233, 237-38 (2019).

In January 2023, the Veteran filed a claim seeking service connection for migraine headaches.    

An April 2023 VA examination concluded with a diagnosis of migraines, including migraine variants.  Thus, the question becomes whether this condition began during the Veteran's military service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent as to any treatment for or diagnosis of migraines or headaches.  The Veteran denied having any history of frequent or severe headaches on a February 1997 medical history report taken pursuant to his separation examination.

The first post service evidence of headaches or migraines did not appear for more than a decade after the Veteran's discharge from the service.  On an August 2005 medical history report, the Veteran denied having any history of frequent or severe headaches.  A March 2009 VA treatment report noted that he denied having chronic headaches.  A February 2016 VA treatment report noted the Veteran's complaints of headaches during the day, resolved with aspirin.  A January 2018 VA treatment report noted the Veteran's complaints of daily headaches for the past month of unclear etiology.  

An April 2023 Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum noted that the Veteran was exposed to a TERA, specifically asbestos, based upon his inservice occupational specialty involving the repair and maintenance of ships while in the Navy.

In April 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for headaches.  The April 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's migraine headaches were less likely than not related to his military service.  In support of this opinion, the VA examiner noted that there was no chronicity of a chronic headache condition during or after his military service.  The VA examiner noted that a post-service event, illness or injury was a more likely etiology for this condition.  

The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's migraines were secondary to his uncontrolled hypertension.  In support of this opinion, the VA examiner noted that hypertension has been identified as one of the most important factors of chronic transformation of episodic migraine and increases the cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk of migraine patients; and that the Veteran's treatment records clearly document that his migraines were secondary to his uncontrolled hypertension. 

The April 2023 VA examiner further opined that the Veteran's migraine headaches were less likely than not caused by his inservice TERA exposure.  In support of this opinion, the VA examiner noted that asbestos exposure is correlated with lung disease and not headaches.  

The October 2024 private examiner opined that the Veteran's migraines were caused and aggravated by his service-connected disabilities.  In support of this opinion, the private examiner noted that the Veteran suffered from back and shoulder pain, and that these conditions cause stress and tension, and will bring on a migraine.  The private examiner noted that medical literature supports a link between psychological stress and headaches, and that stress can be a predisposing factor that contributes to a headache disorder onset, as well as accelerate the progression of a headache disorder into a chronic condition.  The private examiner also noted that the Veteran reported that when his tinnitus bothered him, it would bring on a migraine; and medical literature indicates that tinnitus is known to cause damage to the auditory system resulting in headaches.

The private examiner acknowledged that while multiple documents indicate that the Veteran's hypertension is the cause of his migraines, his treatment records also indicate that the Veteran's migraines predate his hypertension diagnosis.  Thus, the private examiner opined that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have contributed to the development and progression of his migraines, as they have resulted in chronic pain, elevated stress and anxiety levels, ringing in the ears, and tension, which have both triggered migraine episodes and made his existing migraine condition worse in severity.  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's migraines, including migraine variants, were proximately due to or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for migraines, including migraine variants, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 6, 2022, for the award of an increased evaluation of 40 percent for low back strain with degenerative disc disease on an accrued basis. 

The appellant contends that an effective date prior to April 6, 2022, is warranted for the RO's award of an increased evaluation of 40 percent for low back strain with degenerative disc disease.

In the case of a claim for an increased rating, if an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the date of claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of claim.  If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998).  In making this determination the Board must consider all of the evidence, including that received prior to previous final decisions. Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997).

In November 2010, the Board issued a decision which dismissed the Veteran's claims seeking an increased evaluations in excess of 10 percent for his low back strain with degenerative disc disease and right lower extremity radiculopathy.  The Board's decision is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  The Board's decision, however, noted that the Veteran had requested that his testimony at the June 28, 2010, Board hearing should be construed as a new informal claim for an increased evaluation for his low back strain with degenerative disc disease and his right lower extremity radiculopathy.  The Board then referred these matters to the RO for appropriate action.

Although the regulations relating to what constitutes a claim were amended effective March 24, 2015, given that these claims were filed prior to that date, the former regulations are applicable.  Under those regulations, a "claim" was defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998); Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199 (1992).  Any communication indicating intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA was considered an informal claim provided it identified, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  

Under these circumstances, the Board concludes that the Veteran filed an informal claim seeking an increased evaluation for his low back strain with degenerative disc disease on June 28, 2010.  Thus, the question becomes when did an increase in disability for the Veteran's low back disability become factually ascertainable.

As for his right lower extremity radiculopathy, the Veteran's October 2024 NOD requested that the issue of an increased evaluation for the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy, including an effective date back to June 28, 2010, be referred back to the AOJ for adjudication.  Later that same month, the AOJ issued an October 2024 rating decision which granted an increased evaluation of 40 percent for the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy, effective February 26, 2019.  A Notice of Disagreement concerning this decision has not been filed.  Thus, this issue is not currently under the jurisdiction of the Board.

The Veteran's low back strain with degenerative disc disease was rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5242-5237.  Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

Based upon a longitudinal review of the Veteran's claims file, the Board finds that the date of the VA examination for lumbar spine disability, April 25, 2023, is the appropriate effective date for the increased evaluation assigned to the Veteran's service-connected low back disability.  

Prior to April 6, 2022, an increase in the severity of the Veteran's low back strain with degenerative disc disease was not "factually ascertainable." 

A March 2009 VA treatment report noted that the Veteran's back exhibited a normal curvature without scoliosis.  There was no pain on pressure applied along the thoraco-lumbar spine, and no paraspinal muscular spasm.  A December 2009 VA treatment report noted the Veteran's complaints of back and shoulder pains.  

During his June 2010 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he could not sit or stand for prolonged periods of time.  He also reported having muscle spasms in his back if he overexerts himself, such as when he is cutting the grass.  He stated that his back flare up at times for which he will lie down and rest.  

A July 2018 VA treatment report noted his complaints of back and shoulder pain.  An August 2018 VA treatment reported that the Veteran had no back pain.  An April 2019 private treatment report noted a normal lumbar lordosis and no lateral curvature.  

The evidence prior to April 6, 2022, did not show symptoms of or analogous to forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to less than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine less than 120 degrees.  While the record noted a history of low back pain during this time frame, an increase in the Veteran's low back disability was not factually ascertainable.  

The pertinent legal authority governing effective dates is clear and specific, and the Board is bound by such authority.  Pursuant to that authority, the Board finds that there is no legal basis by which an effective date earlier than April 6, 2022, can be assigned for the increased evaluation awarded for Veteran's service-connected low back strain with degenerative disc disease.  Thus, the claim for an earlier effective date must be denied.  

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 27, 2023, for the award of service connection for left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear on an accrued basis.

The appellant is seeking entitlement to an effective date prior to July 27, 2023, for the Veteran's award of service connection for left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear.

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The effective date of an award of disability compensation based on a claim to reopen after a final disallowance shall be the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q)(ii), (r).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2) allow for assignment of an effective date the day following separation from active service if a claim is received within one year after separation from service.

In November 2010, the Board issued a decision which, in pertinent part, dismissed the Veteran's claim seeking service connection of a left shoulder disability.  The Board's decision is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  The Board's decision, however, noted that the Veteran had requested that his testimony at the June 28, 2010, Board hearing, should be construed as a new informal claim seeking service connection for a left shoulder disability.  The Board then referred this matter to the RO for appropriate action.  Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran is shown to have filed an informal claim seeking service connection for a left shoulder disability on June 28, 2010. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon, 12 Vet. App. at 34; Servello, 3 Vet. App. at 199.  Accordingly, the Board must now determine when the date of entitlement arose.  

Based upon its review of the record, the Board concludes that an effective date prior to July 27, 2023, for the award of service connection for left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear is not warranted.  

The Veteran's February 1997 separation examination listed his upper extremities as normal.  A medical history report, completed by the Veteran at that time, noted his complaints of occasional shoulder pain.

An August 2005 physical examination listed his upper extremities as normal.  An August 2005 medical history report, completed by the Veteran, noted that he denied having any history of a painful shoulder.

The Veteran attributed his left shoulder disability to his military service.  His lay statements, however, were not competent to establish a link between his post service left shoulder disability and whatever left shoulder symptoms he may have experienced his service.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of medical pathology and interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Moreover, physical examinations in February 1997 and August 2005 listed his upper extremities as normal.  Moreover, the Veteran denied having any history of shoulder pain on the August 2005 medical history report.  Thus, no continuity of symptomatology was established.  

A May 2007 VA examiner opined that a nexus or link between the Veteran's left shoulder disability and his military service could not be established without resorting to speculations.  The VA examiner noted that continuity of symptomatology was not established.  The Veteran had been out of the service for quite a while and his post service employment was mostly in construction, which could also definitely impact his shoulders.  The examiner considered the evidence of record, including the Veteran's statements, prior to forming this opinion.  The VA examiner also physically examined the Veteran and supported the opinion provided with a sufficient rationale.

In January 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for shoulder and arm conditions.  Following a physical examination of the Veteran, along with consideration of his contentions, the January 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's left shoulder disability was at least as likely as not related to his military service.  The February 2024 rating decision granted service connection for a left shoulder disability based upon the January 2024 VA examiner's opinion.  

The Board concludes that there is no basis for an award of service connection for a left shoulder disability prior to July 27, 2023.  As the most probative evidence weighs against the claim, the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

Increased Evaluation Claims

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule of Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and are intended to represent   the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Other applicable, general policy considerations are: interpreting reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating many accurately reflect the elements of disability, 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in favor of the claimant, 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; where there is a questions as to which of two evaluations apply, assigning a higher of the two where the disability pictures more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating, 38 C.F.R. § 4.7; and, evaluating functional impairment on the basis of lack of usefulness, and the effects of the disability upon the person's ordinary activity, 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  

A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

4. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for low back strain with degenerative disc disease on an accrued basis.

The appellant contends that the Veteran's low back strain with degenerative disc disease warranted an evaluation in excess of 40 percent.  

The Veteran's low back strain with degenerative disc disease is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5242-5237.  Hyphenated Diagnostic Codes are used when a rating under one Diagnostic Code requires use of an additional Diagnostic Code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  Here, the Veteran's low back strain with degenerative disc disease is rated as analogous to degenerative arthritis of the spine (Diagnostic Code 5242) and lumbosacral strain (Diagnostic Code 5237). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5237 and 5242.

Disabilities of the spine are rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (for Diagnostic Codes 5235 to 5243, unless 5243 is evaluated under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes).

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id.  at Note 1.  

Unfavorable ankylosis is defined as "a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching."  Id.  at Note 5.  Additionally, fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) is "always" considered favorable ankylosis.  Id.  

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for the Veteran's low back strain with degenerative disc disease.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due pain, weakened movement, reduced motion, excess fatigability, pain during flare-ups, and pain during repetitive use over time.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by these statements would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  

In April 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for back (thoracolumbar spine) conditions.  The examination report concluded with diagnoses of low back strain, degenerative disc disease, and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  The Veteran reported having pain and tightness in his lower back.  He reported treating this condition with stretching, Ibuprofen, heat, and ice.  During flare-ups, he reported shocking pain that goes down into his right leg.  He also reported having flare-ups once every two months that last for one or two days, with precipitating facts like working in the yard, prolonged sitting or standing.  

Physical examination revealed a range of motion consisting of forward flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 10 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 15 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 15 degrees, with pain on motion throughout.  The VA examiner opined that the range of motion of the lumbar spine after repetitive use or during flare-ups would consist of forward flexion to 15 degrees, extension to 5 degrees, right and left lateral rotation to 10 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 10 degrees, with pain, fatigability, and weakness.  There was no guarding or muscle spasm, 5/5 strength throughout the lower extremities, no muscle atrophy, positive bilateral straight leg raising tests, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and no IVDS.   The report noted that the Veteran did not use any assistive devices as a normal mode of locomotion.

In September 2024, the Veteran underwent a second VA examination for back (thoracolumbar spine) conditions.  The Veteran reported lumbar spine pain with severe right lower extremity neuropathy.  He reported having sharp shooting sensations, being easily fatigued, and unable to ambulate greater than 25 feet.  He also reported taking Morphine, Oxycodone, and muscle relaters daily with only mild relief of symptoms.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran was unable to perform a complete physical examination due to his physical limitations and terminal state.  There was objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the lumbar spine, which was severe and sharp.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's spine after repeated use over time would exhibit forward flexion to 45 degrees, extension to 15 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 15 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 15 degrees.  The VA examiner also opined that the evidence procured did not suggest pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance or incoordination would significantly limit functional ability with flare-ups.  Muscle strength testing revealed reduced lower extremity strength, with no muscle atrophy.  Deep tendon reflexes were absent, and sensory examination revealed decreased sensations through the right lower extremity.  The VA examiner noted that there was no ankylosis of the spine shown; and no neurological abnormalities other than the Veteran's right lower extremity neuropathy.  The report noted that the Veteran did not have IVDS; that he constantly used a walker to ambulate and occasionally a wheelchair.  The Veteran's back condition had a functional impact with labor requiring activities such as repeated flexion or twisting of the spine as these conditions may exacerbate pain and cause impairment with day to day activities.

During his September 2024 VA examination for back conditions, he reported having only mild relief from his medications.  He also reported the use of Ibuprofen during his April 2023 VA examination for back conditions.  It is unclear whether he was taking these medications during the time of his examinations.  Moreover, as he has passed away, a remand to obtain a retrospective opinion on the ameliorative effects of these mediations would be entirely speculative and without probative value.  The Board, however, concludes that the available evidence does not indicate that the ameliorative effects would be significant. Ingram v. Shinseki, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *15-19 (March 12, 2025).  Throughout the course of this appeal, even when considering functional limitation during flare-ups and after repetitive use, the Veteran's low back strain with degenerative disc disease was not shown to have been manifested by unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59.

Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, the Veteran does not have IVDS, and the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  

Regarding neurological impairment, the Veteran has already been granted service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities; and the lay and medical evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has any other neurological abnormality associated with his spine disability.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for low back strain with degenerative disc disease.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an evaluation in excess of 40 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

5. Entitlement to an increased initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy on an accrued basis.

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

In April 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for back (thoracolumbar spine) conditions.  The VA examiner noted diagnoses of low back strain, degenerative disc disease, and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  The Veteran reported having pain and tightness in his lower back.  He reported that he treats this condition with stretching, Ibuprofen, heat, and ice.  During flare-ups, he reported shocking pain that goes down into his right leg.  He also indicated that flare-ups of this condition occur once every two months and last for one or two days, with precipitating facts like working in the yard, prolonged sitting or standing.  The report noted that the Veteran's back condition results in interference with sitting and standing, disturbance of locomotion, and less movement than normal.

Physical examination revealed no guarding or muscle spasm, 5/5 strength throughout the lower extremities, no muscle atrophy, and positive bilateral straight leg raising tests.  Reflex examination and sensory examinations were normal.    As for his left lower extremity radiculopathy, the report noted symptoms of mild intermittent pain, mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and mild numbness of the left sciatic nerve.  No other signs or symptoms of radiculopathy were indicated.  The report noted that the Veteran did not use any assistive devices as a normal mode of locomotion.

In September 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for back (thoracolumbar spine) conditions.  He reported lumbar spine pain with severe right lower extremity neuropathy.  He reported having sharp shooting sensations, being easily fatigued, and unable to ambulate greater than 25 feet.  He also reported taking Morphine, Oxycodone, and muscle relaters daily with mild relief of symptoms.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran was unable to perform a physical examination due to his physical limitations and terminal state.  The VA examiner noted that there was objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the lumbar spine, which was severe and sharp.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's spine after repeated use over time would exhibit forward flexion to 45 degrees, extension to 15 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 15 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 15 degrees.  The VA examiner also opined that the evidence procured did not suggest pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance or incoordination would significantly limit functional ability with flare-ups.  The report noted guarding or muscle spasm relating to radiculopathy of the right lower extremity.  

Muscle strength testing revealed 2/5 strength throughout the lower left extremity, with no muscle atrophy.  Deep tendon reflexes were absent, bilaterally; and sensory examination of the lower left extremity was normal throughout.  The report noted that the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy exhibited no intermittent pain, no paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and no numbness.  

Based on the above, the Board finds that the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy was primarily manifested by no more than mild intermittent pain, mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and mild numbness.  There was muscle weakness in the lower left extremity, with no muscle atrophy and normal sensory examination findings.  The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against a finding that the disability was manifest by trophic changes, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis.  The Board thus finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to mild incomplete paralysis the left lower extremity sciatic nerve.

The Board acknowledges the lay assertions of pain, impairment of motor functions, and sensory disturbance in the left lower extremity.  However, the Board finds the medical of evidence of record to be more probative.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's claims file had been reviewed, and the Veteran's contentions as to the severity of this condition were considered.  Moreover, the VA examiners physically examined the Veteran and also supported opinions provided with a sufficient rationale.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected.  Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an evaluation in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected.  Therefore, a separate or higher evaluation under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.  

6. Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear on an accrued basis. 

The appellant is seeking an increased initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear.  

The Veteran's left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear, is rated under Diagnostic Codes 5024-5201. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5024 and 5201.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the specific basis for the evaluation assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  If the rating is determined on the basis of residual conditions, the number appropriate to the residual condition will be added, preceded by a hyphen (that is, basis first, the residual always come second). Id.  Here, the use of Diagnostic Codes 5024-5201 reflects that the Veteran's left shoulder disability is partially described as tendinitis under Diagnostic Code 5024 and the residual condition is limitation of motion of arm, Diagnostic Code 5201.

Diagnostic Code 2024 instructs to evaluated tendinitis as degenerative arthritis, based on limitation of motion of affected parts.  

Under Diagnostic Code 5201, limitation of motion at the shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees) warrants a 20 percent rating for both the major and minor extremity.  Limitation of motion of the arm midway between side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees) warrants a 20 percent rating for the minor extremity and a 30 percent rating for the major extremity.  Flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from the side warrants a maximum 30 percent rating for the minor joint and a maximum 40 percent rating for the major joint.

Diagnostic Code 5201 "does not provide separate ratings for limitation of motion in the flexion and abduction planes, but rather is addressed generically to limitation of motion of the arm."  Yonek v. Shinseki, 722 F.3d 1355, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear.  The evidence of record shows that the Veteran is right-handed.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain and limited motion.  At his January 2024 VA examination, he reported having issues with lifting his left shoulder above 90 degrees.  He also reported using Motrin several times during the week to treat this condition.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating flexion and/or abduction of the left (minor) arm limited to 25 degrees.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for shoulder and arm conditions in January 2024.  Active and passive range of motion testing of the Veteran's left shoulder revealed flexion to 90 degrees, abduction to 90 degrees, internal rotation to 60 degrees, and external rotation to 60 degrees.  There was pain on motion, pain on weight-bearing, and pain on nonweight-bearing.  There was no additional loss of motion after repetitive use testing.  The VA examiner further opined that the range of motion after repetitive use over time would decrease flexion to 60 degrees, abduction to 60 degrees, internal rotation to 40 degrees, and external rotation to 40 degrees.  The Veteran denied having any flare-ups of his left shoulder condition.  

The VA examiner noted functional loss when working above shoulder level and while lifting and carrying weight.  There was objective evidence of crepitus and localized tenderness or pain on palpation.  The report noted positive rotator cuff testing, no muscle atrophy, no instability, no mechanical symptoms, no residuals of recurrent dislocation (subluxation) or glenohumeral (scapulohumeral) joint, and no humerus impairments.  The VA examiner also added that the Veteran's left shoulder disability prevented him from working above shoulder level.  

The January 2024 VA examination noted that the Veteran takes Motrin several times during the week, and that he has issues with lifting the left shoulder above 90 degrees.  There is, however, no indication as to whether he had taken any medication on the day of the examination; and no there is no way to make this determination under the circumstances of this appeal.  Under these circumstances, including the Veteran having passed during the course of this appeal, a remand to obtain a retrospective opinion on the ameliorative effects of mediations taken for his left shoulder disability would be entirely speculative and without probative value.  Ingram v. Collins, CAVC Docket No. 23-1798 (March 12, 2025).  

During the January 2024 examination, the Veteran indicated that he did not experience flare-ups of this condition.  Moreover, the VA examiner opined that the left (minor) shoulder would continue to exhibit a range of motion consisting of flexion and abduction to 60 degrees, even after repetitive use over time.  This range of motion is greater than that required for the currently assigned 20 percent disability evaluation.  Thus, the Board finds that, even with full consideration of the ameliorative effects of the Veteran's medication usage, entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent is not shown at any point during the course of this appeal. Id.

Since the initial grant of consideration, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms, has the Veteran's left shoulder disability been analogous to limitation of motion of the arm to 45 degrees. See DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 202; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59.  

The Board has considered whether any other Diagnostic Codes related to disabilities of the shoulder would provide for a higher disability evaluation.  However, the evidence does not reflect that the symptoms would warrant a higher evaluation under a different Diagnostic Code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  There is no instability and no history of recurrent dislocation or fibrous union of the scapulohumeral joint.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against assignment of an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's left shoulder impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendonitis and rotator cuff tear.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an increased initial evaluation percent throughout this appeal period, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

7. Entitlement to a TDIU.

A TDIU rating may be granted when it is established that the service-connected disabilities are so severe, standing alone, as to prevent the retaining or obtaining of substantially gainful employment.  If there is only one service-connected disability, it must be ratable at 60 percent or more to qualify for benefits based on individual unemployability.  If there are two or more such disabilities, there must be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Where the percentage requirements for TDIU are not met, a total disability rating may nevertheless be assigned on an extraschedular basis when the veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his or her service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § § 4.16(b).  The Board is precluded from assigning a TDIU rating on an extraschedular basis in the first instance.  Instead, a claim that meets the criteria for referral for consideration of entitlement to a TDIU rating on an extraschedular basis must be referred to the Director of Compensation Service for consideration. See Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 10 (2001).

For a veteran to prevail on a claim for a TDIU rating, the record must reflect    some factor which takes the case outside the norm.  The sole fact that a claimant     is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough.  A high rating in itself is a recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment.  The question is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether the veteran can   find employment. See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

Unlike the regular disability rating schedule, which is based on the average work-related impairment caused by a disability, "entitlement to a TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstances." Rice v. Shinseki, supra.  Therefore, when adjudicating a TDIU claim, VA must consider the individual veteran's education, training, and work history. Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164 (1991) (level of education is a factor in deciding employability); see Friscia v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 294 (1994) (considering a veteran's experience as a pilot, his training in business administration and computer programming, and his history of obtaining and losing 19 jobs in the previous 18 years); Beaty v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 532 (1994) (considering veteran's 8th grade education and sole occupation as a farmer); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991) (considering veteran's master's degree in education and his part-time work as a tutor).

Age may not be considered as a factor when evaluating unemployability or intercurrent disability, and it may not be used as a basis for a total disability rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.19.  There must be a determination that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to produce unemployability without regard to advancing age or a nonservice-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

An assessment of TDIU entitlement based on the combined effects of all service-connected disabilities should address all such disabilities.  Therefore, the cumulative effects (functional impairment) of all service-connected disabilities should be addressed in determining if the service-connected disabilities prevent substantially gainful employment. Floore, 26 Vet. App. 376; accord Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1353-54 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Initially, the Board concludes that the Veteran has met the schedular criteria for a TDIU rating throughout this appeal period.  Specifically, the Veteran filed his intent to file a claim in April 2022 and his service-connected disabilities have been assigned a combined evaluation of no less than 90 percent throughout this period.  

The remaining issue is whether the Veteran is able to secure or follow substantially gainful employment as a result of his service-connected disabilities.

Based upon a longitudinal review of the record, the Board concludes that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have rendered him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.  

In an October 2024 statement, the Veteran indicated that he had not been employed since 2007.  He indicated that his service-connected disabilities affected his daily life and caused limitation.  He indicated that his back, radiculopathy of the lower extremities, and bilateral shoulder disabilities made it difficult to walk, stand, or sit still for more than 10 minutes.  He indicated that his mobility was very limited, as was his physical activities; and that his pain medications caused him to be drowsy.  

The October 2024 private examiner opined that it was more likely than not that the Veteran has been precluded from securing and following substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities, including migraine headaches, which he opined were caused or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities.  

The Board notes that the October 2024 private examiner's opinion is the only medical opinion of record which considered the combined effect of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities on his employability.

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, when the effects of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities are combined, the Board concludes substantially gainful employment could not be retained, and entitlement to a TDIU rating is warranted.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

8. Entitlement to an effective date of April 6, 2022, for the award of an increased evaluation of 20 percent for right shoulder impingement, status post subacromial decompression, arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, and rotator cuff repair with degenerative arthritis, on an accrued basis.

9. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for right (major) shoulder impingement, status post subacromial decompression, arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, and rotator cuff repair with degenerative arthritis, from April 6, 2022, to September 12, 2024, on an accrued basis.

10. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for right (major) shoulder impingement, status post subacromial decompression, arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, and rotator cuff repair with degenerative arthritis, since September 12, 2024, on an accrued basis.

Prior to the August 2024 HLR decision and September 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Board finds that the Veteran identified outstanding private treatment records.  A remand is required to allow VA to obtain these records.

On February 26, 2019, the Veteran submitted an application, VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking an increased evaluation for his service-connected right shoulder disability.  In May 2019, he submitted an operative report, dated that same month, indicating that he underwent right shoulder surgery, including arthroscopic subacromial decompression, arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, and mini open rotator cuff repair.  The surgeon was D.H., M.D., and the procedure was performed at the Havasu Regional Medical Center.  In July 2019, the Veteran submitted an April 2019 private treatment report from D.H., M.D., of Lakeside Orthopedic Institute. 

In June 2019, the AOJ sent correspondence to the Veteran erroneously indicating that his right shoulder injury had been previously denied and that VA regulations required him to file this request on the proper form.  The VA then proceeded to put this claim aside until the Veteran filed another right shoulder disability claim in January 2023.  

The Board accepts the February 26, 2019, application as the date of the Veteran's claim for an increased evaluation in this matter.  In the case of a claim for an increased rating, if an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the date of claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of claim.  If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998).  

Under these circumstances, an attempt should be made to obtain all of the Veteran's right shoulder treatment records from 2018 to 2023.

Finally, because a decision on the remanded issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of an increased evaluation of 20 percent for right shoulder disability could significantly impact a decision on the issues seeking increased disability evaluations for that condition, the issues are inextricably intertwined.  A remand for concurrent adjudication of each of these claims is required.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Ask the appellant to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for the Veteran treatment providers from 2018 forward, including D.H., M.D.; Havasu Regional Medical Center; and the Lakeside Orthopedic Institute.  Make two requests for the authorized records from these treatment providers, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

2.  In readjudicating these claims, the AOJ should accept the Veteran's claim for an increased evaluation for his right shoulder disability as having been filed on February 26, 2019.
