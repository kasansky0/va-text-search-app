ORDER

An initial 10 percent disability rating for bilateral pes planus (plantar warts) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral pes planus disability manifests with the equivalent of pain on manipulation and pain on use during plantar wart outbreaks.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial 10 percent disability rating for bilateral pes planus (plantar warts) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5276.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1964 to March 1966.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  

A Board hearing was held on March 2025 with the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

As the transcript of the March 2025 Board hearing reflects, the Veteran formally and clearly waived the 90-day period following the hearing during which he could submit any additional evidence in support of his appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300(b).  

Additionally, as the transcript of the March 2025 Board hearing reflects, the Veteran also indicated that a grant of 10 percent for his bilateral pes planus disability would satisfy his appeal. See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993).  

As such, and because the Board is granting in full the benefit sought on appeal, the Board will proceed to adjudicate this matter. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations should be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In disability rating cases, VA assesses the level of disability from the initial grant of service connection or a year prior to the date of application for an increased rating and determines whether the level of disability warrants the assignment of different disability ratings at different times over the course of the claim, a practice known as "staged ratings."  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999); see also Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007) (holding that staged ratings may be warranted in increased rating claims). 

Additionally, the evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided.  Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In determining the appropriate evaluation for musculoskeletal disabilities, particular attention is focused on functional loss of use of the affected parts under 38 C.F.R. § 4.40, which indicates functional loss may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by visible behavior on motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.45, factors of joint disability include increased or limited motion, weakness, fatigability, or painful movement, swelling, deformity or disuse atrophy.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is an important factor of joint disability and painful joints are entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. This regulation also requires that, whenever possible, the joints involved are tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint.  See Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158, 168 (2016).

Where functional loss is alleged due to pain upon motion, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and § 4.45 must be considered. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 207-08 (1995). Pain itself does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by § 4.40 and § 4.45 but may result in functional loss only if it limits the ability to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, coordination, or endurance.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 43 (2011).

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that a VA examiner must attempt to elicit information from the record and the Veteran regarding the severity, frequency, duration, or functional loss manifestations during flare-ups before determining that an estimate of motion loss in terms of degrees could not be given.  It also held that any inability to furnish such an estimate must be predicated on a lack of medical knowledge among the medical community at large, rather than insufficient knowledge by the individual examiner.  Id. 

When evaluating joint disabilities rated on the basis of limitation of motion, VA must consider granting a higher rating in cases in which functional loss due to pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination is demonstrated, and those factors are not contemplated in the relevant rating criteria.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  The Court has clarified that although pain may be a cause or manifestation of functional loss, limitation of motion due to pain is not necessarily rated at the same level as functional loss where motion is impeded.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011); Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999); Hicks v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 417, 421 (1995); Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 592 (1991).

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for bilateral pes planus

The Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus disability has been rated as noncompensable since September 13, 2022, under the schedule of ratings for the musculoskeletal system.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5276.

Under DC 5276 for acquired flatfoot, a noncompensable rating is warranted for a "mild" level of disability, with symptoms relieved by build-up shoe or arch support.  

A 10 percent rating is warranted when a unilateral or bilateral disability is of a "moderate" level, with a weight bearing line over or medial to the great toe, inward bowing of the Achilles tendon, and pain on manipulation and use.  

A 30 percent rating is warranted when the evidence shows "severe" bilateral disability with objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use or characteristic callosities.  

A 50 percent rating is warranted when the evidence shows bilateral pes planus that is "pronounced" in nature, with symptoms such as marked pronation, extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the Achilles tendon on manipulation, and lack of improvement after use of orthopedic shoes or appliances.

Terms such as "mild," "moderate," "severe," and "pronounced" are not defined in the regulatory criteria, and the Board must make considerations as to their applicability to symptoms reported in the record in a manner that is "equitable and just." See 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  However, according to MERRIAM WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 999 (11th Ed. 2007), "mild" means slight or gentle; "moderate" means limited in scope or effect; and "severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree.

At the June 2024 VA medical examination, the Veteran reported the onset of his symptoms during service.  Most recently, the Veteran reported treatment by a dermatologist who diagnosed plantar warts and prescribed topical salicylic acid during outbreaks.  The Veteran endorsed bilateral foot pain when the warts reappear.  On evaluation, the Veteran's right foot demonstrated pain.  The Veteran denied bilateral flareups.  He also denied functional loss or functional impairment.  The Veteran did not endorse pain on use of feet, pain on manipulation of feet, swelling or characteristic calluses.  The Veteran's feet did not demonstrate inward bowing of the Achilles tendon, marked inward displacement, nor severe spasm of the Achilles tendon.  The Veteran's feet did not demonstrate decreased longitudinal arch height of one or both feet on weight bearing nor objective evidence of marked deformity.  There was no marked pronation of either foot.

At the March 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran clarified that since retirement his symptoms were reduced because he no longer stood for prolonged periods of time.  He explained that prolonged standing resulted in severe pain during outbreaks and treatment that included having the warts removed by a physician.  He noted that he continued to have monthly flares of warts that he treated himself with prescription medication but that are less severe than when he worked fulltime.  

At the outset, the Board notes it is precluded from denying a higher evaluation based on medication taken to relieve symptoms.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 62-63 (2012) (where the effects of medication are not specifically contemplated by rating criteria, a higher rating may not be denied simply because symptoms are relieved by medication).  

The Board also notes that the Veteran is certainly competent to report his symptoms and describe their effects upon his functioning, and the Board finds these reports credible.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). The Veteran's testimony is highly probative.

Thus, the Board finds that, after discounting any ameliorative effects of his continuous plantar warts medication, and affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Veteran's bilateral pes planus disability manifests as a "moderate" disability, with the equivalent of pain on manipulation and pain on use during plantar wart outbreaks, and warrants a 10 percent rating. 

As the Veteran has indicated that a grant of a 10 percent rating would satisfy this appeal, no further discussion is necessary.
