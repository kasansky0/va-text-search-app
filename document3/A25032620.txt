ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for knee strain is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to his in-service hazardous noise exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the U.S. Navy from June 1992 to July 1996.

A September 23, 2023 rating decision denied service connection for knee strain, and deferred deciding service connection for tinnitus. A November 11, 2023 rating decision denied service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board by requesting the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Direct Review Lane for a reevaluation of the evidence considered by the AOJ. See June 2024 VA Form 10182. As this is a Direct Review appeal under the AMA, the record closed on the date of the September 2023 rating decision for the knee strain claim, and the November 2023 rating decision for the tinnitus claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the respective AOJ decision. See id. If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claims on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. However, because the Board is remanding the knee strain claim, the AOJ may consider later developed evidence as to that claim.

The Veteran requested a Higher-Level Review (HLR) for their tinnitus claim on October 29, 2024, but that VA rejected this request as the tinnitus claim was already pending before the Board in the Direct Review Lane. See February 27, 2025 Correspondence.

Service Connection, Including Presumptive Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and; (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed to have been incurred in service if manifested to a compensable degree of at least 10 percent disabling within one year after service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. If a chronic disease enumerated in 38 U.S.C. § 1101(a) or 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 is diagnosed after separation from service, the nexus requirement of a claim for service connection can be proven by evidence of a continuity of symptomatology. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran contends that his tinnitus began after he experienced hazardous levels of noise exposure related to his duties on the flight deck of the USS Constellation during service. See, e.g., June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ ("I have had ringing in my ears ever since I left the Navy, my job was on the flight deck of the USS Constellation weapons department. The jets were constantly in the areas of which we worked.").

The AOJ made the favorable findings that the Veteran has a current disability diagnosis of tinnitus, and that he experienced hazardous levels of military noise exposure during his duties as an Aviation Ordnanceman. See November 2023 Rating Decision. Therefore, the Board finds these elements of service connection have been established.

Additionally, the Board finds that tinnitus is a presumptively service-connected "organic disease of the nervous system" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), and that the Veteran meets the minimum service requirements for presumptive service connection. See DD-214 (rec'd July 1, 2023); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(1)-(2). See also Walker, 708 F.3d 1331.

The Board next considers whether there is sufficient evidence of record to prove continuity of symptomology for the Veteran's tinnitus disability from within one year of his 1996 discharge. See 38 C.F.R. 3.307(a)(3).

In an October 2023 VA Hearing Examination, the Veteran attested that his tinnitus symptoms began in 1993 as he worked on a flight deck near aircraft during service. He also described his tinnitus as involving "intermittent" ringing with "no set pattern," and in his "right ear mostly compared to left ear." The Board finds the Veteran credible and competent to describe the history and nature of his tinnitus symptomology. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (non-expert witnesses are competent to report that which they have observed with their own senses).

The Veteran's entrance examination indicated he had tubes inserted in his ears at age 3, but that this treatment had resolved the Veteran's childhood ear issues. See September 19, 1991 MPR ("Tubes in both ears OK now."). The Board finds this information relevant to the Veteran's ear health history, but that such ear tube treatment history does not indicate the Veteran had tinnitus symptomology, sensorineural hearing loss, or another relevant organic disease of the nervous system linked to hearing before service. As no other evidence of record clearly or unmistakably demonstrates the Veteran's tinnitus symptomology predated service, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness attaches here. See 38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).

The Board finds that the persuasive weight of the probative evidence of record reflects that the Veteran's tinnitus symptomology began during his active duty service, and his continued to the present.

The Board next considers whether the nexus evidence of record is consistent with a grant of service connection on presumptive grounds.

In an October 2023 VA medical opinion, the examiner opined that (1) the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not related to his hearing loss because the former began in 1993 and the latter began in approximately 2019 "which would indicate separate etiologies;" (2) the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not related to his military noise exposure because his STR's show "no complaint of tinnitus" nor "permanent auditory damage on active duty;" and (3) they were "unable to determine the etiology of tinnitus without resorting to mere speculation. The Board affords the first opinion probative weight as to potential secondary service connection for the Veteran's tinnitus. The Board affords the second opinion no probative weight because it improperly relied solely on the absence of STR's to provide a negative opinion and did not contemplate the Veteran's lay testimony. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (examination was inadequate where the examiner did not comment on the Veteran's report of in-service injury and instead relied on the absence of evidence in the service treatment records to provide a negative opinion). Finally, the Board affords the third opinion no probative weight as it declines to provide an opinion.

In a separate October 2023 VA medical opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus "clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service, was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated beyond its natural progression" during service because the Veteran's STR's do not reflect auditory damage or record related symptomology. The Board assigns this opinion no probative weight because it improperly relies solely on the absence of STR evidence to provide a negative opinion, and it improperly conflates the Veteran's childhood ear tube insertion with tinnitus symptomology. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23; McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243, 256 (2019) (holding that "if the Board finds that a medical text that serves as the basis for a medical opinion contains apparent qualifiers or contradictions, or if the veteran raises the issue or it is reasonable raised from review of the evidence of record, the Board must address that issue and explain whether those aspects of the medical text diminish the probative value of the medical opinion evidence or render the opinion inadequate, and if not, why not").

The Board affords this medical opinion no probative weight as it appears to confuse the Veteran's pre-service tympanostomy (insertion of ear tubes) at age 3 with the development of pre-service tinnitus, and examiner does not contemplate the Veteran's lay testimony on his tinnitus symptomology. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23; McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 256.

Giving the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's tinnitus is related to his hazardous noise exposure during service. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Therefore, entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

REASONS AND BASES FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for knee strain is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his claimed knee strain is related to his lifting heavy weapons and munitions daily as an Aviation Ordnanceman during service. See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ ("Working in the Weapons dep[artmen]ts I was required to lift heavy ordnance daily putting strain on my knees and they have never gotten better. Now they pop when I move them.").

Upon review of the record in this matter, the Board finds that the Veteran has not received a VA medical examination nor nexus opinion for his claimed knee strain disability. The Board also finds that the evidence of record does not appear to contain a formal diagnosis of knee strain or a similar disability nor a private medical nexus opinion, and that there is insufficient evidence at present to make a nexus determination. The VA had a duty to assist to provide an adequate medical examination and opinion. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(a)(1), (d)(1); see Loving v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 96, 102 (2005). On remand, a VA knee examination and medical opinion are warranted to correct these pre-decisional duty-to-assist errors. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the nature and likely etiology of his claimed knee disability. The claims file should be reviewed by the examiner. All necessary tests should be performed, and the results reported. The examiner is then asked to address the following:

(a.) State whether the Veteran's claimed knee disability is related to service, to include his in-service knee pain while lifting heavy weaponry and munitions. See, e.g., June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ ("Working in the Weapons dep[artmen]ts I was required to lift heavy ordnance daily putting strain on my knees and they have never gotten better. Now they pop when I move them.").

(b.) If the examination yields an arthritis diagnosis, whether the Veteran's knee disability is related to his service, or developed within 1 year of the Veteran exiting service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) (establishing arthritis is presumptively service connected where it develops to a compensable degree within one year of exiting service, or symptoms begin within one year of exiting service and continue to the present

2. A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions and conclusions expressed.
