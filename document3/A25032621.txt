ORDER

The appeal of the identification of a duty to assist error during the higher-level review for stomach cancer is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran has not identified a specific disagreement with a March 2024 decision that found a duty to assist error during the higher-level review of a February 2022 rating decision for stomach cancer.

2. The evidence is against finding that the Veteran's stomach cancer is due to service or is otherwise related to an in service injury or disease, to include his presumed toxic exposure risk activities (TERA). 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the identification of a duty to assist error during the higher-level review for stomach cancer have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104, 20.202.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1116, 1131, 5107;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1974 to January 1978. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from March and May 2024 rating decisions issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. §?20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board is aware that less than one year has elapsed since the appealed rating decision was issued, and the Veteran has the right to switch appeal dockets during that one-year period. However, the Board views the Veteran's submissions as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner and has found this to be an implicit waiver of the right to change appeal dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 537 Vet. App. 305 (2024). 

1. A duty to assist error has been identified during the higher-level review for stomach cancer.

Any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the veteran disagrees may be dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). Further, when the relief sought by an appeal has been accomplished, the appropriate course of action is for the Board to dismiss the matter as moot. See Long v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 555, 557 (2004); see also Godsey v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 207, 218 (2019). 

The Board notes that the Veteran has not submitted any additional argument or discussion identifying the nature of the disagreement with the RO's identification of a duty to assist error during the higher-level review of a February 2024 rating decision for stomach cancer. 

In pertinent part, in February 2024, the Veteran filed a request for higher-level review of the February 2024 rating decision, which denied entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer. In the March 2024 rating decision, the RO identified a duty to assist error during the higher-level review of the February 2024 rating decision.

The Board notes that the RO's identification of a duty to assist error in the March 2024 rating decision in response to the Veteran's February 2024 request for higher- level review of the February 2024 rating decision is essentially a favorable decision for the Veteran and, as a result, a March 2024 toxic exposure risk activities memorandum was added to the claims file and a VA addendum examination was requested and provided in March 2024. Following additional development, the RO readjudicated the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer under the supplemental lane review. In a May 2024 rating decision, the RO confirmed and continued the denial of entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer. 

In his June 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran simply noted that he disagreed with the March 2024 rating decision's identification of duty to assist error during the higher-level review of the February 2024 rating decision, without any additional argument specifying why the Veteran disagreed with the March 2024 rating decision.

As noted above, the May 2024 rating decision further denying service connection for stomach cancer has been appealed.  Accordingly, the Board must dismiss the appeal regarding the noted duty-to-assist error, as the issue is moot. See Long, supra. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer.

The Veteran contends that his stomach cancer is related to service, specifically to his duties as an aircraft and engine mechanic. See November 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. 

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection for stomach cancer is not warranted.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury which are clearly present in service or for a disease diagnosed after discharge from service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.?38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Generally, service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event.?38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough,?999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi,?274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran's stomach cancer began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, although the Veteran was diagnosed with stomach cancer during or in proximity to the claim, and he is presumed to have participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during his active service, there is no probative evidence of record showing that the Veteran's stomach cancer had its onset during his active service or is otherwise causally or etiologically related to an in-service event, injury, or disease, to include the presumed TERA. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d).

In this regard, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are negative for complaints, observations, or treatment regarding his stomach cancer condition. In addition, a review of the post-service treatment records shows that the Veteran was initially diagnosed with signet ring cell gastric cancer in April 2023. See April 2023 Private Medical Treatment Records. Accordingly, the evidence does not establish that the Veteran's?stomach cancer?had its onset during service or within one year following his active duty service. 

Additionally, the Veteran's claims file was reviewed by a VA examiner in December 2023. The VA examiner stated that none of the Veteran's exposures that he would have had during service in correlation to his military occupational specialty (MOS) as an aircraft mechanic have been shown to cause or be risk factors for stomach cancer in the current medical literature. Cigar smoking is a known risk factor. The examiner further concluded that the Veteran's stomach cancer is less likely than not caused by his military service, including his MOS as an aircraft mechanic and any toxic or environmental exposures which that involved. The examiner also concluded that it is more likely than not that the Veteran's stomach cancer is due to his history of cigarette smoking. 

In March 2024, an addendum opinion was provided, to include the Veteran's non-deployment related toxic exposure conceded in the March 2024 TERA memorandum. The examiner opined that after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran, it is less likely than not that the Veteran's stomach cancer was caused by his military service including his MOS as an aircraft mechanic and any toxic or environmental exposures which that involved. The examiner also added that it is more likely than not that the Veteran's stomach cancer is due to his history of cigarette smoking. 

The Board finds the March 2024 medical opinion fully adequate and affords it substantial probative value and weight, as it considered the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner's conclusion followed a review of the Veteran's claims file, relevant medical literature, as well as consideration of reported history. See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444 (2000).

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements that his stomach cancer?was caused by service, to include his duties as an aircraft and engine mechanic. See Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 469-70?(1994). That said, and of note to the Board, the Veteran has not asserted continuity of symptomatology of stomach symptoms since service. Moreover, he has not been shown to have the medical training or credentials to relate his presumed in-service toxic exposure activities to the development of stomach cancer, and there is otherwise no competent evidence that suggests such a link. See Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). His lay opinion thus does not constitute competent evidence and lacks probative value. 

In summary, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection for stomach cancer?have not been met. Although the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt where the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is inapplicable where, as here, the evidence is persuasively against the claim for service connection for?stomach cancer. The claim accordingly must be?denied. See?38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?49, 55?(1990).
