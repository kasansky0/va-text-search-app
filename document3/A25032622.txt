DOCKET NO. 240516-442324
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

1.  The severance of service connection for hypertension was proper; the appeal is denied.

2.  Entitlement to service connection for a penile disability, to include erectile dysfunction (ED), as proximately due to his service connected right knee disability, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. It was clear and unmistakable error (CUE) as a matter of law or fact that the Veteran did not have qualifying service for which exposure to herbicide agents is presumed.

2. The Veteran's ED was not incurred in or due to his time in service nor is it due to his service connected right knee.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The severance of service connection for hypertension was proper; the criteria for restoration of service connection for hypertension have not been met. 38?U.S.C. §?5112; 38?C.F.R. §?3.105.

2. The criteria for service connection for ED are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from August 1974 to December 1976 and during June 1991. 

The matter of entitlement to service connection for a penile condition, to include erectile dysfunction is on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision and the severance matter is on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 and March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Severance Claim

The Veteran contends the severance of service connection for his hypertension was erroneous.   

The RO granted entitlement to service connection for hypertension in a May 2023 rating decision.

In a November 2023 rating decision, the RO proposed to sever service connection for hypertension, saying service connection on a presumptive basis was erroneous. 

Research showed that during the Veteran's time in service aboard the USS Ogden, he did not have service determined to have exposure to herbicides via the Korean DMZ or the territorial waters of Guam, Kwajalein, or the Johnston Atoll. 

Simply stated, the Veteran did not serve in Vietnam or anywhere where herbicides were used.

In a March 2024 rating decision, the RO severed service connection for hypertension, effective June 1, 2024, with notice sent to the Veteran in the same month.

Previously granted benefits will be severed only where evidence establishes that the award of service connection was clear and unmistakable error (CUE) (the burden of proof being on the Government). 38?C.F.R. §?3.105(d). 

When severance is considered warranted, a rating proposing severance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The claimant will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that service connection should be maintained. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, final rating action will be taken, and the award will be reduced or discontinued, if in order, effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires. 38?C.F.R. §?3.105(d). 

A change in diagnosis may be accepted as a basis for severance action if the examining physician or physicians or other proper medical authority certifies that, in the light of all accumulated evidence, the diagnosis on which service connection was predicated is clearly erroneous. This certification must be accompanied by a summary of the facts, findings, and reasons supporting the conclusion. 38?C.F.R. §?3.105(d). 

To establish that a grant of benefits was the product of CUE, VA must show that (1) either the correct facts as they were known at the time were not before the adjudicator, the adjudicator made an erroneous factual finding, or the statutory or regulatory provisions were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error was undebatable, not merely a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated; and (3) the error manifestly changed the outcome of the prior decision. See Allen v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?54, 58-59 (2007); Stallworth v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?482, 487-88 (2006); cf. Bustos v. West, 179 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Damrel v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3?Vet. App.?310, 313-14, 319 (1992) (en banc). A clear and unmistakable error is one about which reasonable minds could not differ. See, e.g., 38?C.F.R. §?20.1403(a). 

In most respects, the CUE standard under § 3.105(d) is equivalent to the CUE standard for reversing or revising a prior final decision under 38?C.F.R. §?3.105(a). See Baughman v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?563, 566 (1991). Section 3.105(d) places at least as high a burden of proof on the VA when it seeks to sever service connection as § 3.105(a) places upon an appellant seeking to have an unfavorable previous determination overturned. See id. 

However, the determination is not limited to the law and the record that existed at the time of the original decision. VA may consider medical evidence and diagnoses that postdate the original award of service connection to demonstrate that the diagnosis on which service connection was predicated is clearly erroneous. Stallworth, 20 Vet. App. at 488. The Secretary's burden is not to prove clear and unmistakable error in the original decision in the same manner a claimant would show CUE under sections 5109A or 7111. Id. 

A decision that is reversed or amended based on CUE is revised to conform to the true state of the facts or the law that existed at the time of the original adjudication. Allen, 21 Vet. App. at 62 (internal quotations omitted). 

The standard is high. 

The initial question for the Board is whether the RO followed the due process requirements of 38?C.F.R. §?3.105(d) for severing service connection.   The Board finds that it did.

The RO issued the proposed severance in a November 2023 rating decision.  The Veteran was sent a notification in the same month at his latest address of record of this contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefore and was given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that benefits should be maintained.  The notice letter also informed the Veteran that he had the opportunity for a predetermination hearing if such a request for a hearing was received by VA within 30 days from the date of the notice. See 38?C.F.R. §?3.105(i).   The Veteran did not request such a hearing.  

The RO issued the March 2024 rating decision, which severed service connection for hypertension, effective June 1, 2024.  Notification of this rating decision, plus his appeal rights, was sent to the Veteran in the same month.  The Board finds that this effective date was proper as it was greater than the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date the March 2024 notice expired. See 38?C.F.R. §?3.105(d).  

The remaining question before the Board is whether the grant of service connection for hypertension was CUE.  

For the following reasons, the Board finds there was CUE in the grant of service connection for hypertension.

For those veterans who have been exposed to herbicide agents, certain diseases are acknowledged to be presumptively related to such exposure. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  The diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e) shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service, with exceptions not applicable in the instant case. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(ii). Notably here, hypertension is not one of the diseases listed as subject to presumptive service connection due to herbicide exposure.

"Service in the Republic of Vietnam" includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(6)(iii), 3.309(e). In Haas v. Peake, 525 F.3d 1168 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the Federal Circuit upheld VA's interpretation of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(iii) as requiring proof of some duty or visitation onshore in Vietnam. The herbicide agent presumption includes veterans who served in the 12 nautical mile territorial sea of the Republic of Vietnam. See Procopio v. Wilkie, 913 F.3d 1371, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2019); see also Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 (Pub. Law 116-23 ) (effective January 1, 2020, veterans who served as far as 12 -nautical miles from the shore of Vietnam, or who had service in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone, are presumed to have been exposed to herbicides, such as Agent Orange, and may be entitled to service connection for the disabilities presumed to be caused by herbicide exposure).

A veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, in a unit that, as determined by the Department of Defense (DOD), operated in or near the Korean DMZ (i.e. demilitarized zone) in an area in which herbicides are known to have been applied during that period, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the Veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(iv).

Among other things, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), effective from August 10, 2022 added hypertension to the list of diseases presumed to be associated with exposure to herbicide agents. See PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).

Veterans can claim participation in a TERA explicitly or implicitly through service in a location presumed associated with toxic exposure, or records showing participation in a TERA; or, if VA has conceded exposure in a prior claim, or the file has a claim attributable to toxic exposure. Other ways to claim or establish participation in a TERA include, when a Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) is associated with toxic exposure; when medical records suggest exposure to a toxic substance, chemical, or airborne hazard such as VHA exposure screening; or, with any other relevant evidence of record to include garrison exposures.

The Veteran contends he has hypertension that was due to his time in service to include his exposure to herbicide agents while aboard the USS Ogden from October to November 1976 in the territorial waters of Guam, Kwajalein Atoll, and Johnston Atoll.

It is important for the Veteran to realize that this is not Vietnam.  The presumptions don't apply.  The Veteran's own statements do not suggest direct or indirect exposure to herbicides in the ocean well away from Vietnam. 

The Veteran has been diagnosed with hypertension.  This was noted in the rating decision granting service connection as due to exposure to herbicides and in a March 2023 examination.  However, the grant of service connection was based on the Veteran being exposed to herbicide agents while in service.

The Veteran does not have service during the applicable period for herbicide exposure at the Korea DMZ. While an April 2023 VA memo indicated the Veteran had been exposed to herbicide agents while serving, the Veteran's record indicates he participated in mountain warfare school in Korea in July 1976, outside of the time period for presumptive service connection based on herbicide exposure in Korea.  Other records show the Veteran was aboard the USS Ogden at Lat 00-00, Long 153-00 E. Another record from January 2014, the Veteran certified that he was in doing an exercise in Kora from late July 1976 to early September 1976. Therefore, the Board finds the April 2023 memo was clearly made in error as the Veteran's record does not show he was in Korea between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971.

The record also does not indicate he had boots on the ground service in Vietnam nor that he was aboard a ship, including the USS Ogden, that was within 12 nautical miles of Vietnam during the applicable time period or that he was exposed to herbicides around any of the land masses discussed above. (See e.g. Logbooks.)  Additionally, a professional researcher from VA conducted extensive research and found the Veteran was not exposed to herbicides.  The record also does not indicate the Veteran participated in TERA that at least as likely as not caused his hypertension. 

The Veteran's service treatment records also do not show problems or complaints of hypertension while in service.  Additionally, the record does not show the Veteran's hypertension is at least as likely as not due to any of his service connected disabilities or that he participated in TERA that resulted in his hypertension.

Here, the Board finds there was CUE with the original grant of service connection for hypertension.  The adjudicator clearly made an erroneous factual finding. While the Veteran has been diagnosed with hypertension, the record clearly shows he does not have service that qualifies him for presumptive service connection for such.  This error is undebatable.  The Veteran does not have qualifying service in Korea, Vietnam, the waterways around Vietnam, or when he was on board the USS Ogden around any of the bodies of land discussed above. This error manifestly changed the outcome of the prior decision.  Had the adjudicator properly noted the Veteran's service dates and locations, presumption of exposure to herbicides would not have been conceded and service connection would not have been granted.

As a matter of completeness, the Board also notes there is no other basis upon which service connection could have been granted and was overlooked by the RO. Here, there is no indication the Veteran suffered from hypertension while in service or that it is proximately due to another service connected disability or that he participated in TERA that resulted in his hypertension.  The service and post-service medical records provide highly probative evidence against the claim, indicating clearly and unmistakably a problem that has no connection to service nearly one-half century ago.

Therefore, the Board finds the severance was proper and the appeal is denied.

Erectile Dysfunction Claim

Generally, to prevail on a claim of service connection on the merits, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) medical evidence or other competent evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

To establish service connection on a secondary basis, the evidence must show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a)(b) (2016), Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).

Service connection can also be established through continuity of symptomatology. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.309. For chronic diseases shown as such in service or within the applicable presumptive period, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date are service connected unless attributable to an intercurrent cause. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b). For a chronic disease to be considered to have been "shown in service," there must be a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings. When the condition noted in service or within the presumptive period is not a chronic disease, a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required. Id.

The Veteran contends he has a penile disability, to include erectile dysfunction, that is due to his time in service or that is proximately due to his service connected disabilities including his right knee disability.

The Veteran has been diagnosed with ED.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not indicate any ED or other penile problems while in service. Indeed, multiple examinations show the Veteran not mentioning any types of these problems and indicating he was in good health. (See e.g. December 1987, August 1982, January 1991 STRs.)

The Veteran had an examination for his ED in December 2021.  The examiner saw the Veteran in person, reviewed his file, and noted his diagnosis of ED with the date of onset reported to be in 2015. The examiner opined it was less likely than not the Veteran's ED was proximately due to his service connected right knee.  The examiner said the two conditions are not medically related and a review of medical literature did not show a causal relationship between the two conditions.

An addendum opinion for the Veteran's ED in August 2023, reporting he started having trouble in 2015 and attributed his ED to the medications he took for his service connected right knee. The examiner noted several relevant pieces of evidence and noted the Veteran took medication that the Veteran took for his service connected disabilities.  The examiner stated there was no plausible research which indicated the medication the Veteran took could lead to ED.  Additionally, the examiner indicated the Veteran had other risk factors for ED that had been present, which include diabetes type II, alcohol abuse, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cervical radiculopathy.  

The Board has reviewed the Veteran's entire file but did not find evidence that the Veteran had trouble with ED while in service or that his ED is proximately due to his right knee disability or the medications he takes for it. The evidence does not show any other basis for which the Veteran can be service connected for his ED. The Veteran himself has reported the start of his condition began in 2015, decades after his separation from service and the evidence does not indicate the Veteran's ED is proximately due to his right knee or the medication he takes for it. The Board finds the examinations of record to be adequate because the examiners saw the Veteran in person, reviewed his file, considered his lay statements, and offered opinions supported by rationales.

Regarding the claims above, the Board acknowledges and has considered the Veteran's statements that his ED bothers him and that it is due to his service connected right knee and the medication he takes for it and that he believes the severance of service connection for hypertension was improper.  However, while the Veteran is competent to report the symptoms of his disabilities, he is not competent to opine on matters requiring medical knowledge, such as the nature and etiology of his complex medical condition or whether there was CUE in the original grant of service connection for hypertension.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Thus, while the Board has carefully considered the Veteran's statements about his symptoms, these statements must be weighed against the objective evidence of record, which does not indicate service connection is warranted for ED or that the severance was improper.

Regarding all the above, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  Except as otherwise noted, because the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
