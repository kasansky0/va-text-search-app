REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for squamous cell carcinoma is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from November 1971 to August 1974; from August 1974 to August 1980; and from July 1981 to October 1992.  This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died in September 2023.  The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse and has been accepted as substitute for purposes of the Veteran's claims pending at the time of his death.  See September 2023 Notification Letter.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

During the pendency of the appeal, the appellant filed a motion to advance her case on the docket and claimed financial distress.  See June 2024 Correspondence; June 2024 VA Form 20-10207.  In her motion, the appellant stated that her income had dramatically decreased since the Veteran's death.  See June 2024 Correspondence.  She represented that she was not homeless, or at imminent risk of homelessness.  See June 2024 VA Form 20-10207.  The appellant submitted bills and a bank statement in support of her motion.  The submitted bank statement contained many significant redactions.  See June 2024 Bank Statement.

The Board sympathizes with the appellant's financial situation.  However, there is insufficient documentation in the record to establish that the appellant is currently in severe financial hardship as contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c), such that advancement on the docket is warranted.  Therefore, the motion to advance on the docket due to severe financial hardship is denied.  38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c); 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b).

The Board further acknowledges that on August 22, 2023, VA received from the appellant correspondence dated July 2023, which contained hyperlinks to content that is not otherwise part of the record on appeal; however, that content was not accessed nor considered as part of the record before the Board.  See Bowey v. West, 11 Vet. App. 106, 108-09 (1998) (holding that the mere reference to non VA documents is insufficient to incorporate them into the record).

Last, the Board recognizes the Court's decision in Williams v. McDonough, requiring the Board to afford the appellant the opportunity to modify her docket election in the absence of a waiver of this right.  37 Vet. App. 305, 310 (2024) ("Putting all this together, we agree with Mr. Williams that the Board cannot issue a decision until the time to modify an NOD under § 20.202(c)(2) has run.").  However, as the appellant has repeatedly asked VA to process her claim as quickly as possible, and the Board finds that remand is necessary, the appellant is not prejudiced by the Board's expedient disposition prior to expiration of the time to request a docket switch.

Entitlement to service connection for squamous cell carcinoma 

The appellant contends that the Veteran's squamous cell carcinoma was due to his in service toxic exposure risk activities (TERA).  See August 2024 VA Form 10182.  The late Veteran claimed asbestos exposure while at Hamilton Air Base and exposure to ionizing radiation from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Unfortunately, the Board is unable to grant the appellant's claim at this time because the September 2023 positive opinion of record does not contain any supporting rationale.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  Additionally, although the appellant has demonstrated her sincere belief that a medical nexus is warranted, the appellant does not have medical training such that she is competent to render a medical opinion.  See generally August 2023 Correspondence; Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  Accordingly, although the Board sincerely regrets the delay in a remand, the Board is unable to adjudicate the appellant's claim at this time.  

Remand is warranted because the AOJ committed pre decisional duty to assist errors by (1) failing to make reasonable efforts to ensure all relevant treatment records were obtained; (2) relying on a radiation dose estimate that was based on an improper factual premise; and (3) failing to obtain a medical opinion with sufficient information to decide the claim.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) (explaining that the Board shall remand to the AOJ for correction of a pre decisional duty to assist error); 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  Additionally, as the appellant's radiation claim implicates the AOJ's regulatory duties under 38 C.F.R. § 3.311, remand is also warranted for the AOJ to fully satisfy its regulatory duties under that section.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) (permitting the Board to remand for correction of AOJ error in satisfying a statutory or regulatory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim).

Regarding missing treatment records, during VA treatment in March 2023, the Veteran reported "a remote history" of squamous cell carcinoma of the throat and stated that he had completed radiation therapy in 1994.  The AOJ did not make any efforts to obtain missing records of this treatment from the late Veteran or the appellant.  Thus, remand is warranted for the AOJ to make reasonable efforts to obtain these records.

For direct service connection, the AOJ also failed to obtain a medical nexus opinion with sufficient information to adjudicate the claim.  The AOJ obtained a June 2024 VA medical opinion addressing the Veteran's toxic exposures.  The VA clinician opined that the Veteran's metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activities, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA.

As rationale, the clinician noted the Veteran's risk factors outside of military service as sun exposure and skin type.  The VA clinician noted the Veteran's asbestos exposure while serving as an assistant chaplain during service.  The clinician considered the Veteran's duration, route, and frequency of exposure without using personal protective equipment.  The clinician noted review of the TERA memo and Job Aids resources. 

The VA clinician stated that squamous cell carcinoma arises on those of fair skin in areas of long-term sun exposure, such as the face, ears, bald scalp, forearms, and backs of the hands.  Squamous cell carcinoma may occur on any area repeatedly exposed to the sun, such as the back, the chest, and the legs.  Further, the clinician found that in the Veteran's case, long-term UV light exposure was implicated as the cause based on both epidemiologic observations and molecular analysis of tumor cells.  The clinician pointed to sunlight as the "most frequent association" with development of squamous cell carcinoma.  The clinician also cited general medical principles in support of the opinion.  Among the data cited, the clinician pointed to medical evidence without positive association between squamous cell carcinoma and asbestos exposure.  The VA clinician found no evidence to link the Veteran's squamous cell carcinoma to any exposure other than sun exposure and genetic components.

The June 2024 opinion did not address any other squamous cell carcinoma diagnoses of record, including that of the tongue, which appears to cast some doubt on the purported nexus to sun exposure.  The Veteran's treatment records show evidence of precancerous skin lesions on the face, left neck squamous cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, squamous cell carcinoma of the left cheek, and squamous cell carcinoma of the nose.  See March 2014 Private Treatment Record; October 2014 VA Treatment Records; October 2020 VA Treatment Record; March 2023 VA Treatment Record.  On remand, a medical opinion should address all relevant diagnoses.

Additionally, the AOJ did not obtain an opinion that addressed all relevant medical evidence of record.  The Veteran complained of various skin issues throughout service.  For example, according to a January 1975 service treatment record, the Veteran complained of a "knot" on his neck that became "very sore" one morning.  He was diagnosed with an inflamed papule.  In November 1981, the Veteran was treated for a dry, scaly area under his chin and on his scalp.  See November 1981 Service Treatment Record.  According to an August 1982 service treatment record, the Veteran had seborrheic dermatitis after complaining of scaly lesions on his scalp and forehead.  In August 1987, the Veteran was treated for a skin rash on his face, with a provisional diagnosis of pseudo folliculitis.  In April 1991, the Veteran had a lesion on his lip, and he was assessed with impetigo.  In October 1991, the Veteran complained of a skin problem and was assessed with folliculitis.  In November 1991, the Veteran had lesions in his mouth/the back area of his tongue.  The Veteran continued to seek treatment for skin conditions in December 1991.  At separation, the Veteran reported skin diseases.  See June 1992 Report of Medical History at Separation.  Accordingly, a medical opinion that addresses this evidence is warranted.

Additionally, the AOJ obtained a dose estimate of the Veteran's exposure to ionizing radiation pursuant to its duties under 38 C.F.R. § 3.311.  However, the November 27, 2023 dose estimate opinion relied upon an incorrect factual premise.  See Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 293 (2012); see also Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).  The opinion stated that the Chernobyl accident occurred on April 26, 1986, and that the Veteran was "stationed in Germany after that time."  The opinion estimated that the Veteran was exposed to 0.2 rem based on levels in Germany.  However, the Veteran's service personnel records show that he served in Germany from February 1976 to February 1979, then he served in Italy from November 1982 through May 17, 1986, placing him in Italy during the Chernobyl accident and immediately afterwards.  Thus, remand is warranted for a dose estimate resting on correct facts.  The November 28, 2023 advisory opinion relying on the November 27, 2023 opinion is insufficient for the same reason.  On remand, the AOJ will perform all necessary development pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.311.

After further development on remand, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim for squamous cell carcinoma.  In so doing, the AOJ will consider all relevant evidence of record.  38?C.F.R. §?20.802(c).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. First, make reasonable efforts to obtain missing treatment records referenced by the Veteran during his March 2023 VA treatment, to include missing records of 1994 treatment the Veteran received for squamous cell carcinoma of the throat with radiation therapy.  Ask the appellant to complete a VA Form 21 4142 for all non-VA medical providers, if appropriate.

2. Second, and only after completing the first directive, obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's squamous cell carcinoma.  The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand, must be provided to, and reviewed by, the clinician before rendering the opinion.  The reviewing clinician must opine on:

(a.) Please identify all squamous cell carcinoma diagnoses of record.

i.	In so doing, please consider VA treatment records showing evidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp, face, neck, tongue, left cheek, and nose.

(b.) Whether any diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include in service skin issues of the neck, chin, scalp, forehead, face, lip, mouth/tongue; asbestos exposure, and radiation exposure.

(c.) Whether any diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is at least as likely as not due to the total potential exposure from the Veteran's military deployments.

(d.) Whether any diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is at least as likely as not due to the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities (to include asbestos and radiation).

The clinician should provide full explanation of the rationale for each opinion.  In formulating any opinion, the reviewing clinician should also address all relevant medical and lay evidence of record, including the Veteran's service treatment records.  See January 1975, November 1981, August 1982, August 1987, April 1991, October 1991, November 1991, December 1991, and June 1992 Service Treatment Records.

The reviewing clinician is not to mistakenly rely on an absence of medical evidence in the record to support his or her conclusions.  The Board reminds the clinician that the absence of in-service evidence of a medical diagnosis is not always fatal to a service connection claim, as the laws and regulations do not require in-service complaints of, or treatment for, a diagnosed condition to establish service connection.

If an opinion cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the reviewing clinician must provide a complete explanation for why an opinion cannot be rendered.  In so doing, the reviewing clinician must explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information, or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that question.

3. Third, undertake all steps necessary for review and action pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.311, to include referral to the Under Secretary for Health, for preparation of a dose estimate, to the extent feasible, based on available methodologies.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.311(a)(2)(iii).  Following receipt of such dose estimate by the Under Secretary for Health, forward the claim to the VA Under Secretary for Benefits for consideration in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.111(c).  The Under Secretary for Benefits should determine whether it is at least as likely as not that any exposure to ionizing radiation during the Veteran's service caused or contributed to his development of any diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.311(b)(1), (c).

i.	In performing this development, please be advised that military personnel records evidence that the Veteran was stationed in Italy from November 1982 through May 17, 1986.

4. Only after the AOJ has substantially complied with the first three directives, readjudicate the claim.
