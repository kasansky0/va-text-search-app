The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2022; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The Board notes that in his VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) the Veteran also identified two rating decisions issued in 2006 and 2010, prior to the effective date of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Rating decisions issued prior to the effective date must be appealed under the pertinent Legacy regulations which provide for a different appeal mechanism. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.1 - 19.102. Accordingly, only those issues addressed in the November 2022 AMA rating decision are presently before the Board. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's October 2024 appeal of the November 2022 rating decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) was untimely and dismissal is warranted. 

Except as provided in C.F.R. §  20.402 for simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. The date of mailing the letter of notification of the decision will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). 

An extension of the period for filing a Notice of Disagreement or a request to modify a Notice of Disagreement may be granted for good cause. A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c). 

The Veteran was notified of the November 2022 rating decision by correspondence dated November 22, 2022. VA did not receive the Veteran's VA Form 10182 until October 9, 2024, more than one year following the November 22, 2022, notification letter. The record does not reflect any written request for extension or showing of good cause. 

The Board may dismiss an appeal due to non-jurisdictional reasons, such as a procedural defect, where the claimant did not substantially comply with proper claims processing rules.  See e.g., Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (U.S. 2024).

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was sent a docketing letter in October 2024 informing him that his appeal had been docketed. However, the October 2024 docketing letter specifically advised the Veteran that "it is possible upon more detailed review the Board will determine your appeal request did not meet the necessary procedural requirements. Those procedural requirements may include, but are not limited to, timely submitting your appeal request . . . If the Board identifies such a defect, it may issue a decision dismissing your appeal based on that defect." 

For the reasons outlined above the Board finds that the Veteran's October 2024 VA Form 10182 was not timely as to the November 2022 rating decision, and waiver of the filing deadline is not warranted. Accordingly, the issues of entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension; a compensable rating for left ear hearing loss; and a compensable rating for migraine headaches are dismissed.
