DOCKET NO. 240510-438966
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The probative evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities as likely as not preclude substantially gainful employment that is consistent with his education and occupational experience.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from April 1987 until her honorable discharge in April 1991.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

VA will grant TDIU when the evidence shows the veteran is precluded from obtaining or maintaining any gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience, by reason of his service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  Id.  The central question is not whether the veteran is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment, but whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

A total disability rating may be assigned when the schedular rating is less than total, when, in the judgement of the rating agency, the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one disability, the disability is rated 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability is rated 40 percent or more and there is sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

At the time of the November 2023 decision on appeal, the Veteran was service connected for insomnia disorder, rated as 70 percent disabling, and tinnitus, rated as 10 percent disabling.  The Veteran's combined rating is 70 percent from July 14, 2023.  Thus, the schedular criteria for the assignment of a TDIU pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) have been met.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record reflects that the combined effects of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities at least as likely as not rendered her unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment during the period at issue.

In this regard, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran worked part-time as a tax associate from December 2020 to January 2021 and as a personal care assistant for her mother from November 2022 to June 2023.  However, the evidence of record reflects that the Veteran has not been engaged in substantially gainful employment since November 2017, at which time she stopped working due to her inability to perform the necessary tasks and duties required as a result of her service-connected disabilities.  In a June 2023 private opinion submitted by the Veteran which found that the Veteran more likely than not the Veteran's service-connected conditions render her unable to perform gainful employment.  The clinician explained that the overall instability and chronic nature of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities substantiate her inability to pursue, obtain, and maintain gainful employment at a work level that meets her mental and physical needs.  She further explained that the medication for treatment of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities and the associated side effects hampers her ability to function safely in any type of work environment.  Additionally, in a separate opinion, the Veteran's physical therapist opined that the Veteran is at least as likely as not unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due to her service-connected insomnia and tinnitus.

In light of the above and after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran is unemployable based on the combined effects of her service-connected disabilities.  Accordingly, the Board finds that entitlement to a TDIU is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
