REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

INTRODUCTION

In April 2023, the Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision denying service connection for the Veteran's PTSD for lack of corroboration of an inservice stressor.  The Veteran requested a higher-level review in July 2023.  In November 2023, the RO issued the higher-level review rating decision confirming and continuing the original denial of PTSD.  The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in a July 2024 Notice of Disagreement and selected the Direct Review Lane.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after that decision cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the readjudication of the PTSD disability claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from June 1984 to May 1987 and was stationed in Germany in 1985.  He seeks service connection for PTSD, stating he watched as a fellow service member was run over and killed while working on a motor pole while in Germany.  See May 4, 2021, VAMC Therapy Note (where Veteran specifically names the deceased service member). 

Following a review of the record, the Board finds that a remand is warranted to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 

Specifically, the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD in May 2021 at the Lorain VAMC.  He has consistently reported the same stressor details regarding the incident; however, this stressor has not been corroborated by the VA.  The Board acknowledges that the RO submitted a request to the Records Research Center (RRC) and National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to verify the Veteran's report.  Unfortunately, these organizations were unable to locate any records for the Veteran's battalions during the time he was in Germany.  The Board also notes RRC and NARA did not indicate whether the claimed deceased service member actually served in the Army or died while on active duty.  

The RO should have conducted further development to determine whether the service member the Veteran referenced was in the Army, did in fact serve in Germany, and whether he died in the manner attested to by the Veteran.  Remand is therefore required to cure a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Take appropriate actions to attempt to verify the Veteran's reported in-service stressor, to include: (1) locating records for the battalions the Veteran served in  Germany between 1985 and 1987, (2) verifying the existence of the service member named in the May 4, 2021 VAMC Therapy Note, (3) verifying whether the service member served in the Army, and (4) verifying the manner of death of the service member.  

If the Veteran's stressors cannot be conceded by available evidence, submit a stressor research request to the Military Records Research Center for the stressor.  If more details are needed, contact the Veteran to request the information.  

If, after all the above-mentioned development is conducted, and it is not possible to verify the claimed stressor, issue a formal finding on inability to verify stressors that outlines all efforts to corroborate the claimed stressor.
