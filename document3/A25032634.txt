ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable initial rating for erectile dysfunction is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for erectile dysfunction with or without penile deformity.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There is no legal basis for the assignment of a schedular compensable rating for erectile dysfunction.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.14, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from August 1992 to August 2012.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing was not provided in this case prior to AOJ's initial adjudication in November 2022.  In November 2022, VA amended VA Form 21-526EZ and in May 2024 VA amended VA Form 20-0995 to inform claimants of the right to a hearing at any time during the claims process. The claim in this appeal was filed on a VA Form 21-526EZ prior to the amended version.  The Board finds, however, that any error in the failure to inform the Veteran of the right to a pre-decisional hearing before the Regional Office AOJ was harmless error.

VA regulations provide that, "[u]pon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim . . . before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (d)(1).  That regulation does not indicate that the claimant is entitled to pre-decisional notice of this optional hearing.  In fact, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (b)(1) provides that, following a decision, "[c]laimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief . . . [including] the right to a hearing on any issue involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d) of this section . . . ."  Read together with § 3.103(d), the only notice § 3.103(b) requires is that a claimant be provided notice of the right for a hearing with notification of the decision (by definition, a post-decisional notice). 

In Bowen the Court found that when a claimant is denied a hearing before the RO, there is no due process violation if he is subsequently offered the opportunity for a hearing before the Board, even if a hearing was not requested or conducted, as long as there is no violation of due process concerning the Board hearing opportunity. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253-4 (2012).  The facts in the case can be differentiated on several levels, to include that the Veteran did not actually request an RO hearing and the issue in Bowen was not one of notice.  Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.  In this case, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket in the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) that he signed.  The Veteran selected Direct Docket review by a Veterans Law Judge, and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, the Veteran does not want a Board hearing. Because he was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation or any suggestion that the Veteran was prejudiced by the failure of VA to provide a hearing at the AOJ level. 

Entitlement to a compensable initial rating for erectile dysfunction is denied.

The November 2022 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for erectile dysfunction and assigned a noncompensable (0 percent) evaluation pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522, effective October 11, 2022.  This rating decision also granted entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) for loss of use of a creative organ, effective October 11, 2022.

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction.  

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).  In cases in which a claim for a higher initial evaluation stems from an initial grant of service connection for the disability at issue, multiple ("staged") ratings may be assigned for different periods of time during the pendency of the appeal.  See generally Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). 

Diagnostic Code (DC) 7522 provides that erectile dysfunction, with or without penile deformity, will be assigned a 0 percent rating; thus, a noncompensable rating is the maximum allowable rating.  DC 7522 specifies that for purposes of a VA disability evaluation, a disease or traumatic injury of the penis resulting in scarring or deformity shall be rated under DC 7522.  DC 7522 provides and that entitlement to SMC under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 based on loss of use of a creative organ should be considered.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.  

Turning to the evidence of record, a November 2022 Male Reproductive Organ Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire noted a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.  The Veteran reported he had less interest in sexual activity and when he was interested, he was unable to maintain an erection.  The examiner indicated the Veteran did not have orchiectomy, a voiding dysfunction, or a history of chronic prostatitis, urethritis, epididymitis, orchitis, or urinary tract infections.  On physical examination, the penis, testes, and epididymis were normal, and there were no scars or other disfigurement of the skin related to the Veteran's erectile dysfunction.  The examiner indicated the Veteran did not currently have, and has had, a benign or malignant neoplasm or metastases related to his erectile dysfunction. 

Based upon the medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran is in receipt of the maximum rating allowed under DC 7522.  As noted above, DC 7522 provides a maximum schedular rating of 0 percent for erectile dysfunction with or without penile deformity.  The Board notes that neither the Veteran nor his representative has presented any argument or evidence in support of a compensable rating.  As such, the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating on a schedular basis is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Further, the Board finds that there is no basis for a higher or separate schedular evaluation under any other potentially available provision.  As removal of the glans, complete atrophy or removal of the testis, or removal of half or more of the penis is not shown, a compensable rating under an alternative provision is not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Codes 7521, 7523, 7524.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively against a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction.  In denying such a rating, the Board finds the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
