ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic migraine type headaches is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's diagnosed PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury is etiologically related to his active service.

2. The Veteran's diagnosed posttraumatic migraine type headaches are related to his service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury.

3. The Veteran's diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea is not causally or etiologically related to his active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for service connection for posttraumatic migraine type headaches have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

3. The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2016 to March 2018.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office after the implementation of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the (AMA).

Within the framework of the AMA, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge in July 2024.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that the July 2024 VA Form 10182 incorrectly identifies the "date[s] of decision" for the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as November 2021 and for the remaining issues as December 2021.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  However, the Board finds that the VA Form 10182 was timely as it was submitted within one year of the January 2024 rating decision (denying service connection for unspecified headaches, an anxiety condition, unspecified anxiety disorder, and sleep apnea).  See January 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the July 2024 VA Form 10182 is a timely notice of disagreement to the January 2024 rating decision.

However, on his July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also indicated that he wanted to appeal claims of entitlement to service connection for right shoulder strain and right hip pain, which were denied in a November 2021 rating decision, claims of entitlement to service connection for left shoulder strain and left and right knee sprain, which were denied in a December 2021 rating decision, and claims of entitlement to service connection for left and right hip conditions, which were denied in a March 2022 rating decision.  However, under the AMA framework, an appeal consists of a properly completed VA Form 10182 submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) mails the notice of rating decision being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203, 3.2400, 3.2500.

Here, the July 2024 VA Form 10182 was received more than one year after the AOJ mailed notice of the February 2021, December 2021, and March 2022 rating decisions, and the Veteran did not request an extension of time to file his VA Form 10182 or provide good cause for such an extension.  Accordingly, the only issues on appeal are entitlement to service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic migraine type headaches, and obstructive sleep apnea.  

During the pendency of the appeal, an October 2024 rating decision granted the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic migraine type headaches.  See October 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative.  However, the Board finds that the October 2024 rating decision did not divest the Board's jurisdiction over the above service connection claims.  To the contrary, once a case is in appellate status, the appeal can only be resolved by an appellate body, and as a result, the AOJ's later grant of service connection in a separate claim stream cannot resolve an appeal properly within the Board's jurisdiction.  Johnson v. Collins, No. 23-7589 (Vet. App. March 26, 2025); see also Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 122, 125 (2009); Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203-04 (2021); Warren v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 214, 221 (2016); Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 4 (2023); Myers v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 228, 235-36 (2002).  Thus, the issues of entitlement to service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic migraine type headaches remain on appeal before the Board.  

In addition, the Board has re-characterized the claims for entitlement to service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic migraine type headaches, consistent with the October 2024 rating decision.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23?Vet. App.?1 (2009) (The scope of a disability claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.).

Lastly, the Board notes that additional evidence, to include lay evidence, updated VA and private treatment records, August 2024 VA examination reports and medical opinions, a November 2024 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, and a December 2024 Request for Employment Information, was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  Therefore, the Board may not consider this evidence.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.302(a).  However, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the relevant claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show that a current disability exists and that the current disability was either proximately caused by or proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

1. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury.

2. Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic migraine type headaches, to include as secondary to service-connected disability.

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim in August 2023 and subsequently filed a supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection for an anxiety condition, depression, sleep disturbances, mood swings, and headaches in September 2023.  See August 2023 Intent to File Letter; September 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application.  As noted above, the AOJ denied the Veteran's service connection claims in the January 2024 rating decision, and he subsequently filed a timely VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement in July 2024.  See January 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative; July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

However, during the pendency of the appeal, the Veteran filed a new claim for entitlement to service connection for major depression, sleep disturbance, social isolation, hypervigilance, memory loss, and a traumatic brain injury in July 2024.  See July 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  Thereafter, in an October 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and a traumatic brain injury and assigned a 70 percent rating, effective August 8, 2023, the date of his intent to file a claim.  Specifically, the AOJ found that the Veteran's diagnosed PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and a traumatic brain injury was directly related to his active service.  At that time, the AOJ also granted service connection for posttraumatic migraine type headaches and assigned a 30 percent rating, effective August 8, 2023.  In this regard, the AOJ found that the Veteran's diagnosed posttraumatic migraine type headaches were etiologically related to his service-connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury.  See October 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative.  

Under the AMA, the Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings absent clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  In this regard, the Board recognizes that the October 2024 rating decision was issued during a period where additional evidence cannot be considered under the AMA.  However, such determinations are not considered new "evidence" but rather new legal findings.  Additionally, the record does not contain clear and unmistakable evidence contrary to the legal findings.  As such, the Board is bound by the favorable findings made in the October 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds the Veteran's diagnosed PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury is etiologically related to his active service and that his diagnosed posttraumatic migraine type headaches are related to such disability.  Therefore, service connection for PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress, and traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic migraine type headaches is warranted.  The claims are granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

3. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

The Veteran states that his diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea was caused by an in-service event, injury, or exposure.  He further reported that he had trouble breathing when he was asleep, often woke up gasping for air, and constantly felt drowsy during the day.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis referable to obstructive sleep apnea.  

A review of the post-service treatment records shows that the Veteran sought treatment for sleep disturbances, loud snoring that had caused him to wake up, morning and daytime fatigue, and occasional headaches in January 2023.  The assessment was snoring and fatigue, and the examiner ordered a sleep study.  The Veteran underwent a home sleep test in February 2023 and was subsequently diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea.  

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is not warranted.

In the present case, there is sufficient evidence the Veteran meets the threshold criterion for a current disability.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Specifically, a review of the post-service treatment records confirms that he was diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea in February 2023.  Accordingly, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea is related to his service.

In this regard, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination with respect to his claim of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea during a period of evidentiary review.  As such, the Board has considered whether there was a pre-decisional duty to assist error with regard to the AOJ's determination not to afford the Veteran a VA examination or opinion in connection with his claim.  However, at the time of the January 2024 rating decision, there was no indication that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea could be related to his active service.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  Specifically, the Veteran's STRs are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis referable obstructive sleep apnea, and such was not diagnosed until February 2023, or approximately five years after he was discharged from active service.  Moreover, beyond conclusory lay statements that his OSA was related to an in-service event, injury, or exposure, the Veteran did not provide any information during a period of evidentiary review to explain how his current disability could be related to his active service.  Thus, at the time of the January 2024 rating decision, there was no credible evidence of an event, injury, or disease in service and/or a possible nexus sufficient to trigger VA's duty to provide an examination or opinion.  Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36 (2010); Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010).  Therefore, the Board finds that there was no pre-decisional duty to assist error in the AOJ's determination not to afford the Veteran a VA examination and/or opinion to determine the nature and etiology of his diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea.

In addition, the Board has considered the Veteran's statements that his diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea was caused by an in-service event, injury, or exposure.  However, the question of whether such a relationship exists is a complex medical issue that is far beyond the purview of a lay person.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (2007) (providing that the question of whether lay evidence is competent and sufficient is an issue of fact that is to be addressed by the Board); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994) (noting that personal knowledge is "that which comes to the witness through the use of his senses-that which is heard, felt, seen, smelled, or tasted").

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
