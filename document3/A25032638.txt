FINDINGS OF FACT

The evidence does not show relevant in service injuries or current disabilities or functional impairment of earning capacity from the claimed disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for fractured skull, sinusitis, right and left broken elbows, right wrist injury, broken right hand, right and left broken hips, right and left knee disabilities, and right and left broken ankles have not been met. 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1989 to April 1991. We thank him for his service. He appeals from August 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decisions. He elected direct Board review of the August 2023 AOJ determinations in his October 2023 VA Form 10182. 

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

The Veteran's service treatment records from his period of active duty are unavailable. The Court has held that in cases where records once in the hands of the government are lost, the Board has a heightened obligation to explain its findings and conclusions and to consider carefully the benefit-of-the-doubt rule where applicable.  See O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365, 367 (1991). The following analysis has been undertaken with this heightened duty in mind.  

The Veteran claimed in June 2019 that he broke an elbow, ankle and hip in a parachute accident in 2001; and that he fractured his skull and has bilateral knee disabilities as a result of a parachute accident in 2001. He claimed service connection for right wrist injury in June 2019 without specifying what it was due to.  And in September 2022, he reported that a parachute accident related to deployment caused collateral ligament strain (sounds like he is reporting a knee injury); and that an additional parachute accident caused head injury, fractured elbow, hip and leg injury. He claimed service connection for broken right hand due to an accident in 1989. 

Based on the evidence, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted for fractured skull, sinusitis, right and left broken elbows, right wrist injury, broken right hand, right and left broken hips, right and left knee disabilities, and right and left broken ankles. The only relevant positive entry found in service treatment records reports a leg injury in December 2001, in a December 2001 health questionnaire for dental treatment.

Currently, no competent evidence of current disability stemming from or related to any of the claims, or evidence of functional impairment of earning capacity from the like, has been submitted. The existence of satisfactory evidence of a current disease or injury is a cornerstone of a service connection claim. In the absence of satisfactory evidence of the claimed current diseases, injuries, or disabilities, or evidence of symptoms rising to the level of functional impairment of earning capacity, service connection cannot be granted. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143-144 (1992); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The persuasive evidence is against the claims and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved in the Veteran's favor in this regard. 38 U.S.C.A. ยง 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1991). Accordingly, the claims are denied.
