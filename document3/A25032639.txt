DOCKET NO. 240506-439171
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The discontinuance of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities, from March 1, 2024, was proper and the appeal is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

During the period on appeal, the Veteran did not submit a required "Employment Questionnaire" (VA Form 21-4140) within the required time period in order to retain her TDIU benefits.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The discontinuance of a TDIU, from March 1, 2024, was proper.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.652(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from September 2002 to February 2003 and from June 2006 to June 2008.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Despite electing the Direct Review docket, the Veteran submitted additional evidence with her Notice of Disagreement.  To clarify her intent, the Board sent her a letter in May 2024 to inform her that, if she wanted the Board to consider this additional evidence, she would have to change her appeal to the Evidence Submission or Hearing docket and that she would have to do this within 60 days of the Notice of Disagreement or one year of the AOJ decision on appeal, whichever is later.  Because that period has now ended and the Veteran has not changed dockets, the Board will consider her appeal on the Direct Review docket.  

As stated above, evidence was added to the claims file with the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement and afterward, which was during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claim, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Neither the Veteran nor her representative have raised any specific issue with the duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issue being decided below that occurred prior to the decision on appeal.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

1. TDIU - Discontinuance

Where a reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability or employability status is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons.  The beneficiary will be notified at her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor.  Additionally, the beneficiary must be given notice that she has 60 days to present additional evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at the present level.  Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if additional evidence is not received within that period, final rating action will be taken and the award will be reduced or discontinued effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).

Individuals to whom benefits are being paid are required to certify, when requested, that any or all of the eligibility factors which established entitlement to the benefit being paid continue to exist.  The beneficiary will be advised at the time of the request that the certification must be furnished within 60 days from the date of the request therefor and that failure to do so will result in the reduction or termination of benefits.  If the certification is not received within 60 days from the date of the request, the eligibility factor(s) for which certification was requested will be considered to have ceased to exist as of the end of the month in which it was last known by the evidence of record to have existed.  The claimant will be advised of the proposed reduction or termination of benefits and the date the proposed action will be effective.  An additional 60 days from the date of notice of the proposed action will be provided for the claimant to respond.  If the certification is not received within the additional 60 day period, the proposed reduction or termination of benefits will be put into effect.  38 C.F.R. § 3.652(a).

The Board finds, for the following reasons, that the discontinuance of a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities, from March 1, 2024, was proper.

VA will grant a TDIU when the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of her service-connected disabilities, from securing and following "substantially gainful employment" consistent with her education and occupational experience.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  Marginal employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person.  Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a facts found basis (including but is not limited to employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop), when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

In September 2023, the AOJ sent an "Employment Questionnaire" (VA Form 21-4140) and "Statement in Support of Claim" (VA Form 21-4138) to the Veteran in order for her to certify her employment status.  The accompanying letter notified her that VA had received information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) indicating that she had earned wages above the poverty threshold in 2022.  The letter went on to propose the discontinuance of her TDIU benefit based on evidence of gainful employment and informed her that, in order to continue receiving her TDIU, she must return both forms within 60 days.  The Veteran was also notified that she had a period of 30 days within which to request a predetermination hearing.  A copy of the letter was also sent to the Veteran's then-current representative.  The Veteran did not request a hearing within 30 days or return a completed Form 21-4140 or 21-4138 within 60 days.

In the February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ discontinued the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU, effective March 1, 2024.  The AOJ explained that the Veteran never submitted a completed VA Form 21-4140.

Initially, the Board finds that the AOJ complied with the due process requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) by issuing the September 2023 letter which proposed the discontinuance of TDIU benefits.  The Veteran was then given the appropriate time within which to provide additional evidence, to include a completed VA Form 21-4140.  Thereafter, the AOJ promulgated the February 2024 rating decision, implementing the proposed discontinuance, effective March 1, 2024.  Thus, as the notice and due process requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) have been met, no further discussion in this regard is necessary.

At the time of the February 2024 discontinuance, the Veteran had not returned a completed VA Form 21-4140 or 21-4138 to certify her continued entitlement to a TDIU within 60 days of the September 2023 letter, as requested by the AOJ.  To the extent that the Veteran may contend that she did not receive these forms, there is a presumption of regularity under which it is presumed that government officials "have properly discharged their official duties."  Mindenhall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 271, 274 (1994) (VA need only mail notice to the last address of record for the presumption to attach).  This presumption of regularity in the administrative process may be rebutted by "clear evidence to the contrary."  Schoolman v. West, 12 Vet. App. 307, 310 (1999).  Generally, an allegation of non-receipt, by itself, is insufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity.  Id.  Rather, a claimant bears the burden of producing clear evidence that VA did not follow its regular mailing practices or that its practices were not regular.  Clarke v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 130 (2006).  Once the presumption of regularity has been rebutted, the burden shifts to VA to show that regular mailing practices were followed in mailing the document in question in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, or that the claimant actually received the notice.  Crain v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 182, 186 (2003).

Applying this presumption to the instant case, the Board must conclude that the Veteran received the September 2023 letter and VA Forms 21-4140 and 21-4138.  As noted above, these forms were sent to her address of record and were not returned as undeliverable.  They were also sent to her then-current representative.  There is no other evidence to indicate that the Veteran did not receive the forms.  Hence, the Board does not find that the presumption of regularity has been rebutted and the Veteran received the requested VA Forms 21-4140 and 21-4138, along with the explanatory letter, in September 2023.
