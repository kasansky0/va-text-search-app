On April 7, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. In addition, for withdrawals not made on the record at a Board hearing, such must be in writing, and include the file number and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).  

In the present case, the appellant made a written withdrawal of this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. See Hembree, supra; Martinez v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 320 (2023); see also Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
