ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a mouth or teeth injury, for compensation, is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a mouth or teeth injury, for outpatient VA treatment purposes, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not have a compensable dental disability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, as there is no evidence of tooth loss due to loss of substance of maxilla or mandible.

2. The Veteran did not apply for dental treatment or service connection within one year of discharge.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a mouth or teeth injury, for compensation, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1712(a)(2), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.381, 4.150, 17.161.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a mouth or teeth injury, for outpatient VA treatment purposes, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1712(a)(2), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.381, 4.150, 17.161.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1971 to May 1975.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the Veteran has waived his remaining time to change Board review options and requested immediate review of the issue.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a mouth or teeth injury is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a mouth or teeth injury, for outpatient VA treatment purposes, is denied.

The Veteran contends that he was "hit in the mouth with [a] ladder rung from [a] boat boom while loading on to a motorwhale boat" and has fractured teeth as a result.  See December 26, 2023, Statement.

Legal Criteria

Dental disabilities are treated differently than medical disabilities in the VA benefits system. See 38 U.S.C. § 1712; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.381, 17.161. A claim for entitlement to service connection for a dental disorder for disability compensation is also considered a claim for entitlement to service connection for a dental disorder for purposes of VA outpatient dental treatment. Mays v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 302 (1993). 

Disability compensation and VA outpatient dental treatment may be provided for certain specified types of service-connected dental disorders.  For other types of service-connected dental disorders, the claimant may receive treatment only and not compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1712; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.381, 4.150, 17.161.

Dental disabilities that may be awarded compensable disability ratings are set forth under 38 C.F.R. § 4.150.  These disabilities include chronic osteomyelitis or osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla or mandible, loss of the mandible, nonunion or malunion of the mandible, limited temporomandibular motion, loss of the ramus, loss of the condyloid or coronoid processes, loss of the hard palate, loss of teeth due to the loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible and where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis, when the bone loss is a result of trauma or disease but not the result of periodontal disease.  38 C.F.R. § 4.150, DCs 9900-9916.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.381, treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar abscesses, and periodontal diseases are considered service-connected only to establish eligibility for outpatient dental treatment as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 17.161.  Various categories of eligibility exist for VA outpatient dental treatment. 38 U.S.C. § 1712; 38 C.F.R. § 17.161.  They are as follows:

(a) Class I. Those having a service-connected compensable dental disability or condition may be authorized any dental treatment indicated as reasonably necessary to maintain oral health and masticatory function. There is no time limitation for making application for treatment and no restriction as to the number of repeat episodes of treatment.

(b) Class II. Those having a service-connected noncompensable dental condition or disability shown to have been in existence at the time of  discharge from active service after September 30, 1981, if certain conditions are met, including application for treatment within 180 days of such discharge, see 38 C.F.R. § 17.161(b)(1)(i)-(iii), or those having a service-connected noncompensable dental condition or disability shown to have been in existence at the time of discharge from active service before October 1, 1981, if certain conditions are met, including application for treatment withing one (1) year of such discharge, see 38 C.F.R. § 17.161(b)(2)(i)-(iii), may be authorized for treatment reasonably necessary for the one-time correction of the service-connected non-compensable condition.

(c) Class II(a). Those having a service-connected noncompensable dental condition or disability adjudicated as resulting from combat wounds or service trauma may be authorized any treatment indicated as reasonably necessary for the correction of such service-connected noncompensable condition or disability.

(d) Class II(b). Certain homeless and other enrolled veterans are eligible for a one-time course of dental care.

(e) Class II(c). Those who were POWs for 90 days or more may be authorized any needed dental treatment.

(f) Class IIR. Any veteran who had made prior application for and received dental treatment from VA for noncompensable dental conditions but was denied replacement of missing teeth which were lost during any period of service, prior to the last period of service, may be authorized such previously denied benefits under certain conditions.

(g) Class III. Those having a dental condition professionally determined to be aggravating disability from an associated service-connected condition or disability may be authorized dental treatment for only those dental conditions which, in sound professional judgment, are having a direct and material detrimental effect upon the associated basic condition or disability.

(h) Class IV. Those whose service-connected disabilities are rated at 100 percent by schedular evaluation or who are entitled to the 100 percent rate by reason of individual unemployability may be authorized any needed dental treatment.

(i) Class V. A veteran who is participating in a rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 may be authorized such dental services as are professionally determined necessary for any of the reasons enumerated in §17.47(g).

(j) Class VI. Any veterans scheduled for admission or otherwise receiving care and services under chapter 17 of 38 U.S.C. may receive outpatient dental care which is medically necessary.

Analysis

The initial question is whether the Veteran has a dental disability that qualifies for service connection for compensation purposes.  The Board finds that he does not.

To that end, in a March 2024 VA examination, the examiner found diagnoses of fractures of the teeth.  He noted that the "teeth were repaired by navy dentist but have since deteriorated to the point they are non-restorable."  The examiner did not find a loss of substance of maxilla or mandible.  The examiner also noted that the masticatory surfaces can be restored by suitable prosthesis with a "fixed or removable appliance."  The Board finds this examination adequate and highly probative.  

The Veteran has not asserted a tooth loss due to the loss of substance of maxilla or mandible.  Moreover, he has not shown that he has the specialized education, training, or experience to diagnose tooth loss in general. While lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, the diagnoses and etiologies of tooth loss are complex medical matters in the field of dentistry that fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Thus, the Veteran's lay statements have minimal probative value, and the medical findings have a greater probative value.

Therefore, since the evidence does not show a loss of teeth due to the loss of substance of body of maxilla or mandible, nor any other disability contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, the issue of service connection, for compensation purposes, must be denied. 

Next the inquiry moves to whether the Veteran is eligible for service connection for outpatient VA treatment purposes only.  

The Board finds that the Veteran does not qualify for service connection for a dental condition for VA outpatient treatment.

To that end, the Veteran is not eligible for Class I outpatient treatment because he does not have a service-connected compensable dental disability or condition as explained above.  38 U.S.C. § 1712(b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 17.161(a).  

The Board has also considered whether the Veteran is eligible for Class II  outpatient treatment.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 17.161(b)(2)(i), a Veteran who discharged prior to October 1, 1981, may be authorized any treatment indicated as reasonably necessary for the one-time correction of the service-connected noncompensable condition, if certain criteria are met, including application for treatment within one (1) year after discharge.  Here, the Veteran did not apply for dental treatment or service connection within one year of discharge, and thus, is not eligible under this section.  See 38 C.F.R. § 17.161(b)(2)(i)(B).  Notably, the Veteran's first claim for service connection for a mouth teeth injury, or any dental condition, was his January 2018 VA Claim.

The Board has considered other Classes under 38 C.F.R. § 17.161 that may be applicable.  Applying the facts in this case to the criteria set forth above, the Board finds that none of the above eligibility criteria have been met. The Veteran did not serve in combat, was not a prisoner of war, has not asserted homelessness, has not raised a theory of aggravation from a service-connected disability or authorized disability for VA dental treatment, is not 100 percent service connected, and is not participating in a rehabilitation program.

In sum, the Veteran does not have a compensable dental disability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.150 since there is no evidence of tooth loss due to loss of substance of maxilla or mandible.  Additionally, the Veteran is not eligible for VA outpatient treatment for his dental conditions as he did not file his claim within one year of discharge. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
