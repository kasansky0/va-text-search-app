ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus had its onset during active duty.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1985 to December 1989.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied service connection for tinnitus.  

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), on which he identified the August 2024 rating decision denying service connection for tinnitus and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the time period for requesting a change in the appeal docket has not passed.  Generally, after selecting the Direct Review Docket, a claimant has 60 days from the date of VA's receipt of the Notice of Disagreement, or one year from the date of the decision that is being appealed, whichever is later, to select a different docket.  However, in this case, given that the Board is granting the full benefit sought on appeal, entitlement to service connection, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in deciding the claim before that period has passed.  

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral tinnitus

The Veteran contends that he developed ringing in his ears gradually beginning in 1987 when he was on active duty.  He theorizes that exposure to loud noise as a vehicle mechanic was the cause of the symptoms.  He reports that symptoms have gotten worse, both in frequency and severity over the years since his separation.  

In general, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service' the so-called nexus' requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (citing Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that which is pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection for certain chronic diseases, including other organic diseases of the nervous system such as tinnitus, may also be established on a presumptive basis by showing that such a disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a) (3), 3.309(a).  In such cases, the disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a).  

To establish service connection under this provision, there must be: evidence of a chronic disease shown as such in service (or within an applicable presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307), and subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease; or if the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, by evidence of continuity of symptomatology after service.  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) relating to continuity of symptomatology, however, can be applied only in cases involving those conditions explicitly enumerated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The standard of proof to be applied in decisions on claims for VA benefits is set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  Under that provision, VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary.  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  The evidence must be persuasively against the claim for the benefit of the doubt to be inapplicable in a claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran's DD214 and personnel records show that he was a vehicle mechanic in the United States Army while on active duty.  In the August 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made a favorable finding that this type of military occupational specialty comes with a high probability of hazardous noise exposure.  At his November 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus.  Based on this evidence, in the August 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made a favorable finding of a current disability.  Absent clear and unmistakable evidence, the Board is bound by these favorable findings.  As such, the only question for the Board at this point is whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed tinnitus had its onset during active duty with continuity of symptomatology since separation or is otherwise causally related to an in-service disease or injury.  

The Veteran's service treatment records do not contain any report of symptoms consistent with tinnitus.  There is no indication the Veteran received treatment for tinnitus while on active duty.  

The Veteran underwent an examination of his hearing acuity and tinnitus in October 2019.  The Veteran noted experiencing significant tinnitus during his post-service period, around 1990.  He reported symptoms manifested in a hissing sound that occurred 5 to 6 times every day.  The examining clinician diagnosed the Veteran with tinnitus but opined it was not as likely as not incurred during service because tinnitus was not reported until after separation and there was no evidence of complaint of tinnitus in the Veteran's service treatment records.  

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a letter from his spouse along with his Supplemental Claim.  In the letter, the Veteran's spouse recounts that she remembers him reporting symptoms of ringing in his ears while on active duty.  She stated that the Veteran complained of these symptoms after being exposed to loud noises while working in the motor pool as a mechanic.  She also stated that she encouraged the Veteran to report the symptoms, but that he had spoken with the other members of his unit, and they all had experienced the symptoms and been told there was no treatment for them.  

The Veteran underwent an examination of his tinnitus and symptoms in November 2023.  At that examination, he reported that he began experiencing symptoms of ringing in the ears while on active duty around 1987.  He reported that he noticed symptoms appeared after being exposed to loud noise through the course of his duties.  After reviewing the record, the examiner determined the Veteran's current tinnitus was less likely than not due to his military noise exposure because the condition had not been reported or recorded in service and because there had not been significant threshold shifts in hearing acuity between entrance, separation, and a prior 2019 VA examination of the Veteran's hearing.  

The Board finds that both VA medical opinions are inadequate.  In both cases, the clinician discounted the Veteran's report of symptoms onsetting during the 1-year period after service and during service, without providing a rationale for doing so.  Instead the opinions relied on the lack of documentation of a disability during service.  As such, the opinions are inadequate.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007) (holding that a lack of documentary evidence during or after service cannot be the sole basis for an opinion against a claim).   

Because of the inherently subjective nature of tinnitus, it is readily capable of lay diagnosis.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2014); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307 (2007) (noting that lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology and may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection).  Thus, the appellant is competent to report when he began experiencing symptoms of ringing of the ears and the history of his symptoms.  

Because the record contains no evidence upon which to find the Veteran's statements lack credibility, the Board finds that the record establishes an in-service incurrence of the disability.  While the Veteran's service treatment records are silent regarding complaints of tinnitus in service, for the reasons discussed above, the Board finds the Veteran is competent to state that he has had tinnitus since his period of active service.  Further, the Board finds the Veteran's assertions credible, as his statements are consistent with his wife's statements regarding the onset of his disability and consistent with his duties working as a vehicle mechanic, which has a high probability for exposure to hazardous noise.  

In weighing the evidence, the Board has determined that the Veteran is competent to report his onset of symptoms and finds no reason to determine he is not credible on this issue.  The Board notes the Veteran did give two separate accounts of when his symptoms onset, with one being during service and one being within a year of separation from service.  The Board notes the Veteran's account at his November 2023 VA medical examination is more consistent with the statement his spouse submitted in August 2023.  However, even were the Board to find the report of the Veteran noticing symptoms in the year after separation more credible than the other, it would still fall within the presumptive period for the development of chronic diseases.  

Thus, after reviewing all the evidence of record, the Board finds the evidence is at least in approximate balance on the question of whether the Veteran's tinnitus began during his period of active duty and continued with the same symptomatology since service.  As such, granting the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran's tinnitus disability had its onset while he was on active duty and that symptoms of that disability have been recurrent since service.  Therefore, the Board concludes that the criteria for service connection are met for this claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.
