FINDINGS OF FACT

1. High cholesterol or hyperlipidemia is a laboratory measurement which by itself does not constitute a recognized disability for purposes of VA benefits entitlement.

2. The evidence of record does not support a diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for high cholesterol, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hyperlipidemia, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310, 4.2.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in active-duty service with the Marine Corps from January 1984 to January 1988.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in February 2024 and March 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

Procedurally, a February 2024 rating decision adjudicated the issues for a bilateral eye disability and PFB; and a March 2024 rating decision adjudicated the issues for diabetes mellitus type 1, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, high cholesterol, and hyperlipidemia.

The Veteran requested a February 2024 Higher Level Review of the February 2024 rating decision for PFB; then submitted an April 2024 10182 form appealing the February 2024 and March 2024 rating decision selecting the Direct Review option.

Under the AMA, when a claimant seeks appellate review through the Board's direct docket, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 131 Stat. 1114, 38 U.S.C. § 7113 (b).

As such, the evidentiary period concerning a bilateral eye disability and PFB closed at the February 2024 rating decision; and the evidentiary period concerning diabetes mellitus type 1, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, high cholesterol, and hyperlipidemia closed at the March 2024 rating decision. Therefore, the Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the February 2024 rating decision for a bilateral eye disability and PFB; or consider evidence submitted after the March 2024 rating decision relating to diabetes mellitus type 1, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, high cholesterol, and hyperlipidemia. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. Therefore, the Board may not consider this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board next notes that during the pendency of the appeal favorable findings were made to include finding the Veteran had a current diagnosis for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. As such, the Board is bound by the favorable findings. AMA, Pub. L. No. 115-55, § 5104A, 131 Stat. 1105, 1106-07.

Service Connection

Service connection is granted on a direct basis when there is competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d).

Service connection for chronic diseases listed in 38 U.S.C. sections 1101 (3) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), may be established on a presumptive basis if the chronic disease was shown as chronic in service; manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period, usually one year, after separation from service; or was noted in service with continuity of symptomatology since service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307, 3.309(a).

When evaluating the evidence and rendering a decision on the merits, the Board is required to assess the credibility and probative value of proffered evidence in the context of the record as a whole. See Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 26 (1998). When a claimant seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the claimant prevails.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The evidence must be persuasively against the claim for benefits to be denied.  See Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).

High Cholesterol, Hyperlipidemia

The Veteran has claimed service connection for high cholesterol and hyperlipidemia.

Symptoms or clinical findings, such as laboratory findings, are not disabilities within the law. Absent evidence of a current disability, a claim for service connection must be denied. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

The Veteran's hyperlipidemia represents only a laboratory finding and is not a disability for which VA compensation benefits are payable. See 61 Fed. Reg. 20440, 20445 (May 7, 1996) (diagnoses of hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, and elevated cholesterol are actually laboratory results rather than disabilities and are therefore not appropriate entities for the rating schedule to address). The evidence of record does not identify or suggest underlying diseases to which the claimed symptoms or laboratory findings may be related.

As a result, service connection for high cholesterol and hyperlipidemia must be denied in the absence of a current disability for VA purposes.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB)

In a December 2023 claim, the Veteran claimed service-connection for PFB due to work and field activity in service with limited shaving products available to use.

After review of the record, the Board finds the evidence is persuasively against a finding of service connection for PFB.

Review of the Veteran's treatment record does not show any complaints, treatments, or diagnoses relating to PFB. The evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 rating decision does not show any objective medical evidence to demonstrate a current disability for PFB.

The Board notes that in the February 2024 rating decision that adjudicated the Veteran's claim for PFB, the rating decision considered VA medical center (VAMC) records from September 10, 2009 through February 2, 2024. 

VAMC records received on February 20, 2024 show a February 5, 2024 VAMC record where the Veteran requested a dermatology consultation for shaving bumps and was prescribed medication for PFB.

However, as addressed above, the Veteran's appeal stems from the February 2024 rating decision; under AMA, Higher Level Reviews are limited to the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision the Veteran requested a Higher-Level Review of or appealed with a submitted 10182, which in this case was the February 3, 2024 rating decision.

Therefore, the evidentiary record under review closed with the February 2024 rating decision to include VAMC records from September 10, 2009 through February 2, 2024. As addressed above, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify any new and relevant evidence to be considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The Board notes the Federal Circuit's holding in Saunders v. Wilkie, which stated that even in the absence of a presently diagnosed condition, pain can cause functional impairment, and that in that situation, "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability. " Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). However, the Veteran has not identified any reported pain relating to the Veteran's claimed PFB or how it would have resulted in functional impairment.

The Board notes that there was no examination held for the Veteran's PFB. However, the Board finds VA was not obliged to provide an examination or obtain an opinion on the Veteran's claimed conditions because there was no competent evidence that shows the Veteran has a current PFB disability. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006) (holding that an examination and medical nexus opinion is required for a service connection claim when there is evidence of current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, evidence establishing in-service event, injury, or disease, or a disease manifested in accordance with presumptive service connection regulations, and an indication that the current disability may be related to an in-service event, injury, or disease; but insufficient evidence to decide the claim); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d), 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4)(i).

As the threshold for finding that the evidence of record indicates that there is a claimed current disability has not been met, VA was not obliged to provide an examination or obtain an opinion in response to this claim. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements and testimony regarding their claimed issues. While the Veteran is competent to report observable symptomatology, the Veteran lacks the medical training and expertise necessary to provide a probative opinion on the medically complex issue such as the nature and etiology of a PFB disability. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994), Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

With the absence of a current disability for a PFB disability during the current appeal period, the analysis ends, and the claim for service connection for a PFB disability, whether on a direct or secondary basis, cannot be granted. See Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 ; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53-56.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Board finds remand is warranted for remand.

Hypertension, Bilateral eye disability

As noted above, a favorable finding was made that the Veteran has a current diagnosed hypertension disability. Review of the record shows in October 2017 the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral cataracts.

In an August 2023 claim, the Veteran claimed an eye disability due to being assaulted in a bar during service and suffering a head injury that led to vision problems. In a December 2023 claim the Veteran claimed a bilateral eye condition relating to service that started as pressure to forehead and headaches then later show up with blurriness and floaters. In a February 2024 claim for "floaters" the Veteran described issues with his vision since service.

In a February 2024 claim the Veteran claimed his hypertension was treated during service and worsened over time.

Review of the record does not show a VA examination has been held regarding the Veteran's claimed hypertension and bilateral eye disability. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006).

However, as the Veteran has asserted that events that occurred during service resulted in or caused his claimed hypertension and/or bilateral eye disability, the Board finds remand is warranted to obtain a VA examination and opinion on the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed hypertension and bilateral eye disability in relation to service.

Diabetes Mellitus

In a February 2024 claim for diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2; the Veteran claimed the onset of his disability during service and that the Veteran "wasn't aware of what it was" at the time.

Review of the record does not show a VA examination has been held regarding the Veteran's claimed diabetes mellitus. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006).

However, as the Veteran has asserted the onset of his claimed condition during active-duty service, the Board ind remand is warranted to obtain a VA examination and opinion on the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed Diabetes Mellitus type 1 and type 2.

The Board also notes that in a December 2022 VAMC visit to reestablish care, the Veteran reported that he sees an outside provider who manages his diabetes mellitus.

Review of the record does not show any of the records identified by the Veteran in the December 2022 VAMC visit have been associated with the claims record. As such, the Board finds remand is also warranted to obtain outstanding records to associate with the claims record. See, e.g., 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (e)(2) (if VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before deciding a claim, VA will, among other things, request that the claimant provide a release for the records).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request that the Veteran complete a VA Form 21-4142 and provide the names and addresses of any and all healthcare providers who provided treatment for the Veteran's claimed Diabetes mellitus as identified in the December 2022 VA medical center (VAMC) visit.

2. Schedule the Veteran for VA examinations to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed hypertension. The record and a copy of this remand must be made available to the examiner.

Based on this review of the record, and examination if provided, the examiner should provide opinions that respond to the following:

(a.) Is it as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent or greater probability) that the Veteran's hypertension began during or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty military service?

3. Schedule the Veteran for VA examinations to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed bilateral eye disability. The record and a copy of this remand must be made available to the examiner.

Based on this review of the record, and examination if provided, the examiner should provide opinions that respond to the following:

(a.) Identify all current bilateral eye disabilities. "Current" is defined as any condition identified since the filing of the claim (or approximate thereto) to the present. "Disability" includes any diagnosable conditions as well as pain or symptoms that are not diagnosable but, nonetheless, cause functional impairment.

(b.) All diagnostic findings must be reconciled with any conflicting evidence in the record; if a previously documented diagnosis is deemed incorrect or obsolete (i.e., subsumed by a more appropriate diagnosis), the examiner must explain why.

(c.) Is it as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent or greater probability) that the Veteran's bilateral eye disability began during or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty military service?

4. Schedule the Veteran for VA examinations to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed Diabetes Mellitus type 1 and type 2. The record and a copy of this remand must be made available to the examiner.

Based on this review of the record, and examination if provided, the examiner should provide opinions that respond to the following:

(a.) Is it as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent or greater probability) that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type 1 began during or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty military service?

(b.) Is it as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent or greater probability) that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type 2 began during or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty military service?

(c.) The examiner is also advised that the Veteran is competent to report in-service events and treatment, and the Veteran's symptoms and history, and such reports and assertions to include the Veteran and appellant's testimony and statements must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinions. If the examiner rejects the Veteran's reports, the examiner must provide a reason for doing so. In doing so, the examiner should reconcile any contrary medical evidence of record.

(d.) A complete rationale for any opinion expressed should be provided.
