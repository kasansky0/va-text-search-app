FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States from September 1969 to August 1971. In February and March 2023, the Veteran filed claims with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 

In June and August 2023, the VA Regional Office (RO) issued rating decisions pertinent to the issues on appeal. In March 2024, the Veteran noted a timely appeal of the rating decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board). 

The appeal is prosecuted pursuant to the modernized review system.    

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Board has reviewed the evidence in the Veteran's claims file.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this Decision, there is no requirement that every piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail.  

Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claims and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claims.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-130 (2000).

I.

Service Connection Claim - Legal Criteria and Analysis

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

To establish direct service connection for a claimed disorder, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999). 

Tinnitus is a chronic disease listed under section 3.309(a) of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations; therefore, the presumptive service connection provisions based on "chronic" in-service symptoms and "continuous" post-service symptoms under section 3.303(b) apply.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  Presumptive periods are not intended to limit service connection to diseases so diagnosed when the evidence warrants direct service connection.  The presumptive provisions of the statute and VA regulations implementing them are intended as liberalizations applicable when the evidence would not warrant service connection without their aid.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The Veteran contends that he has tinnitus related to his active service. Specifically, in his original claim for benefits, in March 2023, he indicated that his tinnitus was due to hazardous noise in combat. 

For the following reasons, the Board agrees and finds that service connection is warranted. Initially, the Veteran is competent to report in-service noise exposure and his reports are consistent with the circumstance of his service. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). His DD Form 214 lists a military occupational specialty (MOS) of Light Weapons Infantry. He is a recipient of the Purple Heart and Combat Infantry Badge, amongst many other awards and decorations. The Board finds the Veteran is a combat veteran and he is entitled to the evidence easing provisions of the combat presumption. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(d).

In the August 2023 rating decision, the RO found that the evidence of record showed that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service. Namely, the Veteran's MOS showed a high probability of noise exposure in service. The RO also found that the Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus in an  April 2023 VA examination.

The Board does not disturb these favorable findings by the RO. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Accordingly, the Board finds the first two elements of service connection to be satisfied.

Turning to the third element, medical nexus, the Veteran was afforded a VA-contracted examination in April 2023 in which the examiner stated that he reported onset of tinnitus approximately 10 years ago, which was 40 years after discharge from active duty military service. The examiner stated that it was widely accepted that noise-induced tinnitus occurred at the time of the noise exposure, and did not develop years later. Therefore, the examiner opined that it was less likely than not caused by or the result of military noise exposure. An addendum VA-contracted opinion was obtained in July 2023 in which a negative opinion was provided related to the Veteran's toxic risk exposure activities (TERA). 

The absence of in-service evidence of disability, however, is not fatal to a service connection claim. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). Moreover, the Veteran is not claiming that his tinnitus is related to TERA. For these reasons, the Board gives the VA-contracted examiners' opinions little weight.

An addendum VA-contracted opinion was obtained in August 2023 in which the examiner opined that the tinnitus was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by noise in service. The examiner stated that while there was no record of treatment for or diagnosis of tinnitus during service, the Veteran was a combat veteran; therefore, his statements that his disability was incurred in or aggravated by combat would be accepted as sufficient proof as it was consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of combat service even though there was no official record of such incurrence or aggravation in the Veteran's service treatment records. 

The examiner stated that while the treatment records were silent regarding tinnitus, it was quite common for tinnitus to go unreported until it reached a pervasive level. The relationship between noise exposure (such as cannons and helicopters, all without the use of hearing protection), acoustic trauma, auditory damage, and tinnitus was documented in the research, and the objective evidence supported a nexus of auditory damage.

The Board finds the August 2023 opinion to be competent and persuasive evidence that the tinnitus had onset in, and is related to, the Veteran's active military service and affords it great probative weight.

All three elements of direct service connection are met for tinnitus, and the claim is granted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304.

II.

Increased Ratings Claims - General Legal Criteria

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations.  38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.321(a), 4.1. 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38?C.F.R. §?4.7. 

It is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified; findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom are sufficient; and above all, a coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38?C.F.R. §?4.21. 

In accordance with sections 4.1 and 4.2 of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations and Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589 (1991), the Board has reviewed all evidence of record pertaining to the history of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. The Board has found nothing in the historical record which would lead to the conclusion that the current evidence of record is not adequate for rating purposes. 

When it is not possible to separate the effects of a non-service-connected condition from those of a service-connected disorder, reasonable doubt should be resolved in the claimant's favor with regard to the question of whether certain signs and symptoms can be attributed to the service-connected disability. Mittleider v. West, 11?Vet. App.?181, 182 (1998); see also 38?C.F.R. §?3.102. 

Additionally, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §?4.3. 

Where the criteria for a compensable rating are not met, a noncompensable rating will be assigned.?38 C.F.R. § 4.31. Separate disability ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not "duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology" of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown,?6 Vet. App. 259, 262?(1994).? 

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). 

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). 

That said, higher evaluations may be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). This practice is known as staged ratings. Id. 

The Board is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). 

Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

III.

Hypertension - Legal Criteria and Analysis

The Veteran is seeking an initial compensable disability rating for hypertension. The Veteran's hypertension is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101, pertaining to hypertension, a 10 percent rating is assigned with evidence of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent rating is assigned with evidence of diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. A 40 percent rating is assigned with evidence of diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. A 60 percent rating is assigned with evidence of diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that in considering whether a 10 percent rating may be assigned under Diagnostic Code 7101, the Board must examine historical blood pressure readings taken before the veteran began continuous hypertension medication, even if outside the appeal period. Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021).

Service treatment records show blood pressure readings, to include: 107/66 in July 1969; 120/78 and 135/72 in August 1970; 110/76 in October 1970; and 118/74 in May 1971.

VA treatment records are replete for blood pressure readings, to include: 134/78; 146/82; 163/81; 140/75; 162/83; 144/84; 128/76; 164/76; 134/76; and 127/85.

The Veteran was afforded a VA-contracted examination in March 2023. The examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of hypertension and that his treatment plan included taking continuous medication. The examiner did not find the Veteran had a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominately 100 or more. On examination, the Veteran's blood pressure readings were 168/82, 144/72, and 144/76. 

Considering the pertinent evidence, and in light of the governing legal authority, the Board finds that a 10 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for hypertension. VA treatment records and the March 2023 examination show that the Veteran's systolic pressure occasionally ranged near or above 160. The March 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's treatment plan included taking continuous medication for his blood pressure. The record reflects that the Veteran has continuously been prescribed at least one type of blood pressure medication, to be taken daily. Such symptoms more nearly approximate the criteria for a 10 percent rating, especially considering his treatment plan included taking continuous medication for his blood pressure.

A rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted at any point, as diastolic pressure has not been predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more and systolic pressure has never been shown to be 200 or more.

All potentially applicable diagnostic codes have been considered, and there is no basis to assign an alternative evaluation. See Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 593.

In addition to the medical evidence above, the Board has considered the lay evidence in the form of the Veteran's statements.  A layperson is competent to testify regarding the onset and continuity of symptomatology. Heuer v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 379 (1995); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398 (1995); Caldwell v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 466 (1991). 

However, affording the Veteran full competence and credibility, his statements do not show impairment more closely approximating the criteria for a higher rating. 

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively in favor of awarding a disability rating of 10 percent for hypertension, but not higher. As such, the claim is granted. The RO will set an effective date for the grant. This preserves the Veteran's right to appeal the effective date awarded by the RO. See DAV v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d. 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

IV.

Loss of Teeth - Legal Criteria and Analysis

The Veteran is seeking an initial compensable disability rating for loss of teeth.

The Board notes that VA has amended the rating criteria for dental and oral conditions effective from September 10, 2017. These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after September 10, 2017. Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied. The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

The Veteran's disability is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Code 9913, for loss of teeth due to loss of substance of body of maxilla or mandible without loss of continuity. Diagnostic Code 9913 was not changed by the September 10, 2017 amendments.

Under Diagnostic Code 9913, for loss of teeth due to loss of substance of body of maxilla or mandible without loss of continuity, a noncompensable rating is warranted where the loss of masticatory surface can be restored with suitable prosthesis.

A 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 9913 is warranted for all upper and lower teeth on one side are missing where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for all lower anterior teeth are missing where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for all upper anterior teeth are missing where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis.

A 20 percent rating is warranted for all upper and lower anterior teeth are missing where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis. A 20 percent rating is also warranted for all upper and lower posterior teeth are missing where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis.

A 30 percent rating is warranted for loss of all lower teeth where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis. A 30 percent rating is also warranted for loss of all upper teeth where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis.

A 40 percent rating is warranted for loss of all teeth where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis.

A Note to Diagnostic Code 9913 provides that these ratings apply only to bone loss through trauma or disease such as osteomyelitis, and not to the loss of the alveolar process as a result of periodontal disease, since such loss is not considered disabling.

The Veteran was afforded a VA-contracted examination in May 2023 in which the examiner noted that the masticatory surfaces could be restored by suitable prosthesis, noting upper and lower partial dentures. The Veteran's missing teeth were noted on the right upper as numbers: 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7; left upper: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16; left lower: 17, 18, 19, and 20; and right lower: 30, 31, and 32.

Based on the foregoing, a higher rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 9913 for loss of teeth as the masticatory surfaces could be restored by suitable prosthesis.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran has had many missing teeth; however, the criteria for a higher rating; namely, the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis, is not shown.

All potentially applicable diagnostic codes have been considered, and there is no basis to assign an alternative evaluation. See Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 593. In addition to the medical evidence above, the Board has considered the lay evidence in the form of the Veteran's statements.  A layperson is competent to testify regarding the onset and continuity of symptomatology. Heuer, 7 Vet. App. 379; Falzone, 8 Vet. App. 398; Caldwell, 1 Vet. App. 466. However, affording the Veteran full competence and credibility, his statements do not show impairment more closely approximating the criteria for a higher rating. 

As the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. For these reasons, the claim is denied.

V.

Residuals, Shell Fragment Wounds - Legal Criteria and Analysis

The Veteran is seeking entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for residuals, shell fragment wounds. This disability is rated under Diagnostic Code 9902.

Under Diagnostic Code 9902, loss of one-half or more of the mandible, including ramus, unilaterally and bilaterally, is rated as follows: When temporomandibular articulation is involved, a 70 percent rating is warranted for loss not replaceable by prosthesis and a 50 percent rating is warranted for loss replaceable by prosthesis. When temporomandibular articulation is not involved, a 40 percent rating is warranted for loss not replaceable by prosthesis and a 30 percent rating is warranted for loss replaceable by prosthesis.

Loss of less than one-half the mandible, including ramus, unilaterally and bilaterally, is rated as follows: When temporomandibular articulation is involved, a 70 percent rating is warranted for loss not replaceable by prosthesis and a 50 percent rating is warranted for loss replaceable by prosthesis. When temporomandibular articulation is not involved, a 20 percent rating is warranted for loss not replaceable by prosthesis and a 10 percent rating is warranted for loss replaceable by prosthesis.

The Veteran was afforded a VA-contracted examination in May 2023. The examiner noted that the Veteran lost less than one-half of the mandible including the ramus, unilateral, and not involving the temporomandibular articulation. The examiner noted that the lost part of the mandible was replaceable by prosthesis. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent under Diagnostic Code 9902 is not warranted. In order to be awarded a higher evaluation, the evidence must show that he has loss not replaceable by prosthesis, loss of one-half or more of the mandible, or involvement of the temporomandibular articulation. However, the evidence shows that the Veteran has less than one half of the mandible with no involvement of the temporomandibular articulation, which is restorable by a suitable prosthesis.

All potentially applicable diagnostic codes have been considered, and there is no basis to assign an alternative evaluation. See Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 593. In addition to the medical evidence above, the Board has considered the lay evidence in the form of the Veteran's statements.  A layperson is competent to testify regarding the onset and continuity of symptomatology. Heuer, 7 Vet. App. 379; Falzone, 8 Vet. App. 398; Caldwell , 1 Vet. App. 466. However, affording the Veteran full competence and credibility, his statements do not show impairment more closely approximating the criteria for a higher rating. 

As the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable. See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. For these reasons, the claim is denied.

VI.

Maxillary Sinusitis - Legal Criteria and Analysis

The Veteran is seeking entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for maxillary sinusitis.

The General Rating Formula for sinusitis is listed at 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Codes 6510-6514. Under the General Rating Formula, a non-compensable rating is assigned where the condition is detected by X-ray only. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Codes 6510-6514.

A 10 percent disability rating is awarded for sinusitis manifested by one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or by three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. 

A 30 percent rating is assigned when there are three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. Id.

A 50 percent rating is assigned following radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis, or near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain and tenderness of affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries. Id.

An incapacitating episode of sinusitis means one that requires bed rest and treatment by a physician. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6513 at Note 1.

The criteria for rating sinusitis are conjunctive, meaning that each element of the criteria is needed to meet the requirements for the specified evaluation. See Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360 (2007); see also Melson v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 334 (1991) (use of the conjunctive "and" in a statutory provision means that all the conditions listed in the provision must be met).

The Veteran was afforded a VA-contracted examination in April 2023 in which he reported sinus congestion and drainage with headaches. The examiner noted symptoms to include headaches, pain of affected sinus, tenderness of affected sinus, purulent discharge, and three non-incapacitation episodes of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting in the past 12 months. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's sinusitis does not warrant a rating in excess of 10 percent disabling. The Veteran's sinusitis has been manifested at worst by three non-incapacitating episodes per year characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.

A higher evaluation of 30 percent is not warranted unless the evidence shows three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting; this has not been shown in this case.

All potentially applicable diagnostic codes have been considered, and there is no basis to assign an alternative evaluation. See Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 593.

In addition to the medical evidence above, the Board has considered the lay evidence in the form of the Veteran's statements.  A layperson is competent to testify regarding the onset and continuity of symptomatology. Heuer, 7 Vet. App. 379; Falzone, 8 Vet. App. 398; Caldwell, 1 Vet. App. 466. 

However, affording the Veteran full competence and credibility, his statements do not show impairment more closely approximating the criteria for a higher rating. As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for the maxillary sinusitis, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply, and the appeal is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran is seeking an initial disability rating in excess of 20 percent for TMJD. His TMJD is rated under Diagnostic Code 9905.

The AMA abrogated the Secretary's duty to assist for cases on appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(e)(2).  But the duty to assist remains in full force when a claim is before the RO for adjudication. Id. § 5103A(e)(1). And if the Board identifies a duty-to-assist error that occurred prior to the issuance of the decision on appeal, it must remand the matter to the RO to cure the error. Id. § 5103A(f)(2)(A). 

As discussed below, the Board finds that there is pre-decisional error in this case, and a VA examination is required on remand to cure the error. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA-contracted examination in May 2023 in which it was reported that he had scar tissue that inhibited full range of motion; trismus (lockjaw). Physical examination showed pain with chewing (mastication) that caused functional loss (described as trismus) in active and passive motion, weight bearing, non-weight-bearing, and on rest/non-movement.

Although the rating criteria for TMJD under Diagnostic Code 9905 does not mention ankylosis, the highest evaluation is rated on interincisal motion down to zero degrees and the jaw is a joint. See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 20 (2021) (criteria for a rating based on ankylosis may be met by evidence demonstrating the functional equivalent of ankylosis).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) construed the final sentence of section 4.59, which states "[t]he joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint." Id. at 164 (citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.59) (emphasis added). The Court held that "we are left with the inescapable conclusion that, to be adequate, a VA examination of the joints must, wherever possible, include the results of the range of motion testing described in the final sentence of § 4.59." Correia, 28 Vet. App. at 169-70.

So, the question for the Board is whether deciding the claim without obtaining a VA examination that comports with the requirements of Chavis and Correia constitutes a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error, for which the Board must remand the claim to cure.  Accordingly, the locus of the inquiry is on what was before the RO at the time of the decision on appeal.

In this case, the November 2023 examiner did not address the aforenoted pain reported in active and passive motion, weight bearing, non-weight-bearing, and on rest/non-movement as required by Correia, and did not address whether there is ankylosis or evidence demonstrating the functional equivalent of ankylosis as required by Chavis. 

For the reasons set forth above, based only on the evidence of the record at the time the RO issued the rating decision on appeal, the Board concludes a VA examination in accord with the caselaw should have been afforded prior to a decision being made on this claim. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (holding that once VA has provided a VA examination or obtained a medical opinion, it is required to provide or obtain one that is adequate for the purpose sought). The Board concludes that the error must be cured, on remand, by affording the Veteran an examination that comports with the requirements of Chavis and Correia, as outlined below.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of his service-connected TMJD. The electronic claims file must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner. 

The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria, to include whether there is ankylosis or evidence demonstrating the functional equivalent of ankylosis.

The examiner should conduct all indicated tests and studies, to include range of motion studies expressed in degrees and in relation to normal range of motion, and should describe any pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, and incoordination present. To the extent possible, express any functional loss in terms of additional degrees of limited motion, i.e., the extent of the Veteran's pain-free motion.

Pursuant to Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), record the results of range of motion testing for pain on both active and passive motion and in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing. If a joint cannot be tested, please specifically indicate why that testing cannot be done. 

Pursuant to Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the examiner is instructed to inquire whether there are periods of flare-ups. If the answer is "yes," the examiner should state their severity, frequency, and duration explaining if there are any additional or increased symptoms and limitations experienced during flares. The examiner must ALSO name the precipitating and alleviating factors. The examiner must ALSO estimate, "per [the] veteran," to what extent, if any, they affect functional impairment. 

The examiner must explain the rationale for all opinions, citing to supporting factual data or medical literature, as appropriate.

2. Following completion of the foregoing, the RO should review the record and readjudicate the claim on appeal.
