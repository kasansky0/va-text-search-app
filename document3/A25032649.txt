ORDER

Service connection for major depressive disorder is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Major depressive disorder had its onset during service. See July 1995 Service Treatment Record (STR), August 2023 VA Form 21-4138, February 2024 VA Medical Opinion.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for major depressive disorder are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 4.125; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1972 to December 1995. This matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeal (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted his claim for an acquired psychiatric condition. See February 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. In May 2022, the RO denied this claim. In response, in July 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, seeking review of the May 2022 rating decision. In September 2022, the RO identified that a duty to assist error occurred. Thereafter, in February 2023, the RO again denied this claim.

Subsequently, in March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking readjudication of the February 2023 rating decision. In May 2023, the RO again denied this claim. In response, in August 2023, the Veteran submitted a second VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking readjudication of the May 2023 rating decision. 

In March 2024, the RO again denied this claim. In response, in June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) and selected the Direct Review docket at the Board.

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of March 12, 2024-the date of issuance of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after March 12, 2024, the Board did not consider it. 

As a final note, in June 2024, the Veteran was informed that he had a year from the date his rating decision was mailed to him or within 60 days of the date the Board received his NOD to switch his Board review option. The Veteran did not respond to the Board's June 2024 letter. As more than year passed since the March 2024 rating decision was issued, and the 60-day period specified in the June 2024 letter has lapsed, the Board finds that the period to switch his Board review option has expired. Accordingly, the Board will proceed with the adjudication of his appeal.

Service Connection

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table).

As noted in the Conclusion of Law section, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for major depressive disorder. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is granted.

Here, the Veteran contends that the major depressive disorder's (MDD) symptoms had their onset in service and continued to the present. See August 2023 VA Form 21-4138. He also stated that he did not seek treatment because he would be discharged for reporting these symptoms. Id.  He also reported that during service, he was in fear of missile in attacks and experienced significant loss, which caused his MDD symptoms. Id. and April 2022 VA Medical Opinion. 

Here, the record clearly establishes a current disability, as medical evidence shows diagnoses of MDD and other specified depressive disorder. As such, the first element of service connection is met.

Regarding the requirement of in-service incurrence, the Board finds that, as reported by the Veteran, his MDD had its onset in service. In this regard, the Veteran reported that his depression began in service and continued into the present. See August 2023 VA Form 21-4138. He specifically stated that he did not seek treatment for his symptoms because he did not want to be discharged for admitting that he experienced these symptoms. Id. He described multiple distressing experiences that caused his MDD symptoms. Id. Specifically, he reported that eight servicemembers from his unit were killed, and he had to tell one of the servicemember's wives that her husband passed away. Id. He also reported that he was in constant fear of missile attacks during his deployment. Id. Further, his STRs show treatment for memory loss, and the April 2023 VA examiner opined that this was a symptom of MDD. He also reported that he lost his grandmother and father, while he was deployed. He reported that after these distressing events, his MDD began in service. The Board finds the Veteran, as a layperson, to be credible and competent to discuss the onset of symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (holding that laypersons are competent to report and provide testimony regarding symptoms they experience with their own senses).  Accordingly, the Board finds that the second of element of service connection has been met.

Turning to the last requirement of a nexus between current MDD and service, the Board finds that one has been established. Specifically, a February 2024 VA examiner opined that the MDD was caused by his deployment in Southwest Asia. In this regard, the examiner found that his statements were consistent with the circumstances, conditions, and hardships of combat service. Comparatively, the April 2022 and April 2023 VA examiners opined that it was less likely than not that MDD was caused by service. In this regard, the examiners relied on a lack of mental health diagnosis or treatment in service and his post-service medical records. Interestingly, neither examiner reconciled his in-service treatment for memory loss and the April 2023 VA examiner's finding that his memory loss was a symptom of MDD. The examiners also failed to address his distressing experiences in service.

In Lynch v. McDonough, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) held that, under 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), the benefit-of-the-doubt principle may be triggered where the evidence of record is nearly equal.  21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (citations omitted).  The Federal Circuit further explained that this interpretation of 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) "necessarily includes scenarios where the evidence is not in equipoise but nevertheless is in approximate balance."  Id.

The Board finds Lynch to be applicable in the instant case as the evidence of record is in approximate balance, but not equipoise, regarding whether the Veteran's MDD was caused by service versus other factors.  Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that a positive nexus to service has been established, resulting in a grant of the Veteran's claim. Thus, entitlement to service connection for MDD is warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.
