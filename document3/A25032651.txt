REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disorder is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2010 to April 2011, with service in Afghanistan.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Although the Veteran appealed an April 2023 rating decision in the March 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Board has interpreted the decision on appeal to be the February 2024 rating decision because it is part of the same chain of continuous pursuit and allows for a greater evidentiary record to be considered.

After reviewing the evidence of record, and in light of Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the Board has recharacterized the issue of service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) to encompass any respiratory disorder.

Entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disorder.

The Veteran asserted he has COPD and asthma related to his service in Southwest Asia. See, e.g., January 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

The Veteran's pulmonary function tests (PFTs) during a February 2023 VA examination were normal. See also September 2023 VA medical opinion (stating that the Veteran does not have a disability because his PFTs were normal). During an August 2023 HLR Informal Conference, the Veteran asserted that he had to do the PFTs repeatedly "until he got a good reading." He stated he could hear wheezing in his lungs afterwards. After resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that remand for a new VA respiratory examination is warranted to obtain new PFT results to clarify whether the Veteran has a respiratory disability. 

August 2023 VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran is diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, a respiratory disability. However, the February 2023 VA respiratory examination did not prompt the examiner to discuss obstructive sleep apnea. As a result, remand for a new examination to determine the nature and cause of the Veteran's sleep apnea is warranted.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ should arrange for VA examinations of the Veteran to determine the nature and likely cause of any respiratory disorder, including sleep apnea, to include new PFTs. The examiner should provide an opinion with detailed rationale that responds to the following:

(a.) If present, is the Veteran's sleep apnea or other respiratory disorder at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to his in-service exposure to toxins due to service in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War era? When providing this opinion, the examiner must consider the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

(b.) If present, does the Veteran's sleep apnea or other respiratory disorder have an understood or partially understood etiology or pathophysiology? Please explain why. Both etiology and pathophysiology must be discussed.
