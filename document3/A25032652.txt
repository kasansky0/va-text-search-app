FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction onset in March 2009; a claim for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction was reasonably raised in conjunction with the March 11, 1991, claim for entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer; and each claim remained pending until the July 2024 and October 2024 rating decisions on appeal.

2. The persuasive weight of the evidence is in support of a finding that the Veteran was shown to have had a service-connected disorder that resulted in the loss of use of a creative organ from March 1, 2009.

3. The persuasive weight of the evidence is in support of a finding that the Veteran's hypertension has required continuous medication for control with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more. Diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more, has not been demonstrated.

4. The persuasive weight of the evidence is in support of a finding that the Veteran has experienced occasional dizziness as a result of his hypertension, but not occasional staggering.

5. The persuasive weight of the evidence is in support of a finding that the Veteran has been unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from June 1969 to June 1972.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board of Veterans' Appeals' (Board) docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).

This matter is on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which adjudicated the issues of entitlement to an increased initial disability rating for the Veteran's right sciatic nerve radiculopathy and lower back strain with degenerative arthritis as well as entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for right sciatic nerve radiculopathy based on the evidence of record at the time of the decision. The Veteran requested higher level review of these claims in December 2023 through the submission of a VA Form 20-0996. The Veteran's claims were subsequently denied in a December 2023 rating decision.

This matter is also on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a VA RO which adjudicated the issues of entitlement to increased initial disability ratings for the Veteran's hypertension and vertigo based on the evidence of record at the time of the decision.

This matter is also on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by a VA RO which adjudicated the issues of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction and SMC due to loss of use of a creative organ based on the evidence of record at the time of the decision.

This matter is also on appeal from an October 2024 rating decision issued by a VA RO which adjudicated the issue of entitlement to an increased initial disability rating for bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor based on the evidence of record at the time of the decision.

The Veteran subsequently filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) in December 2024 in which the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission option. Accordingly, this decision has been written consistent with the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework.

In this case, as to the issues of entitlement to increased initial disability ratings for the Veteran's right sciatic nerve radiculopathy and lower back strain with degenerative arthritis as well as entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of entitlement to service connection for right sciatic nerve radiculopathy, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, which is dated January 3, 2023, and which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. 

As to the issues of entitlement to increased initial disability ratings for the Veteran's hypertension and vertigo, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, which is dated March 27, 2024, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

As to the issues of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction and SMC due to loss of use of a creative organ, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, which is dated July 18, 2024, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

As to the issue entitlement to an increased initial disability rating for bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, which is dated October 17, 2024, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision. Id. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. However, as to those issues the Board is remanding, any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider in this decision will be reviewed by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Earlier Effective Dates

The statutory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110. The effective date of an award based on an initial claim of compensation is either the day following separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, it will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b). This includes original claims, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase (as described under the legacy appeal system) and initial or supplemental claims (as described under the AMA). Id. However, the effective date of an award of increased compensation to a Veteran shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred, if the claim for increase is received within one year of such date. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997). Determining the appropriate effective date for an increased rating therefore involves an analysis of the evidence to determine (1) when a claim for an increased rating was received, and (2) when the increase in disability actually occurred. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

With respect to the effective dates of awards of SMC, the Board notes that claims for SMC are a type of increased (i.e., "special") compensation. SMC is available when, as the result of a service-connected disability, a veteran suffers additional hardships above and beyond those contemplated by the rating schedule. See Breniser v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 64, 68 (2011); see also 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k)-(s). A veteran is presumed to be seeking the maximum benefit allowed by law or regulation; therefore, an appeal for a higher rating may include the inferred issue of entitlement to SMC even where the veteran has not expressly placed entitlement to SMC at issue. See Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118 (1991). Thus, claims for earlier effective dates for SMC are treated analogously to claims for earlier effective dates for increased ratings. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o), 3.401(a). 

A rating decision is considered final if an appeal is not perfected within one year of the notification of the decision. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160, 20.201, 20.302. However, under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), new and material evidence received during the appeal period after a decision issued under the legacy system will serve to preclude that decision from becoming final unless the decision is reconsidered. See Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (holding that, in determining whether a decision became final, VA is required to determine whether any evidence received within one year of the decision is new and material and prevented the decision from becoming final under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b)).

Under the AMA, which became effective in February 2019, a determination on a claim by the AOJ becomes final unless the claimant continuously pursues the claim by filing a supplemental claim, a request for higher-level review, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1). If a claimant continuously pursues an issue by filing one of these administrative review options within one year, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). 

The term "date entitlement arose" is not specifically defined in the current statute or regulation. The Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. This is determined on a "facts found" basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. Prior to March 24, 2015, VA recognized both formal and informal claims. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014). The amendments also, in pertinent part, eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155 (2016). The amended regulations apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Prior to March 24, 2015, the term "claim" meant a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a specific benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014).

The Board is mindful that the "identification of the benefit sought" requirement does not necessitate technical precision. Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 256-57 (2007). A claimant may identify the benefit sought by referring to a body part or system that is disabled or by describing symptoms of the disability. See Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86-87 (2009); see also Grimes v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 84 (2021) (holding that "a claim for service connection may encompass a related condition that is initially referenced by the claimant but not diagnosed until later in the appeal stream").

While VA has an obligation to interpret a claimant's submissions broadly, VA is not required to conjure up issues not raised by claimant. VA is therefore not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998) (medical records cannot constitute an initial claim for service connection but rather there must be some intent by the claimant to apply for the benefit); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995).

1. Entitlement to an effective date of March 1, 2009, but no earlier, for the award of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction.

In the December 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran asserted that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than December 5, 2023, for the grant of entitlement to a service connection for erectile dysfunction. See December 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. 

In June 2022 the Veteran submitted a claim, in pertinent part, of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction. See June 2022 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). In a January 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was denied entitlement to service connection for his erectile dysfunction but was granted service connection for bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor effective December 10, 2021. See January 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative. In response, the Veteran requested higher-level review in December 2023. See December 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.

The Veteran was then afforded a VA examination in March 2024 to assess the nature and likely etiology of his erectile dysfunction. See March 2024 C&P Exam (Male Reproductive Organ). At that time, relevant to this claim, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction began in March 2009 following "frequent cystoscopies for bladder cancer" which resulted in "a lot of scar tissues." Id. In the accompanying medical opinion, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was "at least as likely as not ... proximately due to or the result of bladder cancer status post trans urethral resection of bladder tumor." April 2024 C&P Exam (Erectile Dysfunction Secondary Opinion). 

Thereafter, in a July 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction as secondary to his service-connected bladder cancer, effective December 5, 2023, which was identified as "the day VA received [the Veteran's] claim." July 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative. Subsequently, following a review of the evidence of record, an October 2024 rating decision granted an earlier effective date of March 11, 1991, for the award of service connection for bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor. See October 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative. The Veteran then asserted entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction in the December 2024 notice of disagreement which gave rise to this appeal. See December 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

Given the above, the Board finds that the Veteran's entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction was reasonably raised as part of his claim of entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer. The evidence of record contains nothing that would lead the Board to believe the Veteran was not seeking service connection for any and all impairments related to his service-connected bladder cancer, including erectile dysfunction. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2) ("[o]nce VA receives a complete claim, VA will adjudicate as part of the claim entitlement to any ancillary benefits that arise as a result of the adjudication decision) (emphasis added); Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2) requires VA "to develop and adjudicate related claims for secondary service connection for disabilities that are reasonably raised during the adjudication of a formally initiated claim for the proper evaluation level for the primary service-connected disability"); see also Grimes, 34 Vet. App. at 84 (holding that "a claim for service connection may encompass a related condition that is initially referenced by the claimant but not diagnosed until later in the appeal stream"). 

In so finding, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was not specifically identified as part of the Veteran's March 1991 claim of entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer. However, during the pendency of that claim, the Veteran's treatment records, lay statements, and VA examinations indicated that the Veteran suffered from erectile dysfunction. Additionally, the competent and probative evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was proximately related to his bladder cancer. Therefore, a claim of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction, to include as a symptom of the Veteran's bladder cancer, could be construed when sympathetically and liberally read. See Shea v. Wilkie, 926 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2019). 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the date of receipt of the initial claim as to entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is March 11, 1991. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). Having so determined, the remaining question before the Board is precisely when it first became factually ascertainable that the Veteran became entitled to receive service connection for his erectile dysfunction. Id. The Board again notes that the Court has interpreted the date entitlement arose as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35 (holding that in determining the date entitlement arose, when an original claim for benefits is pending, the Board must determine when a claimant's disability manifested itself under all the "facts found" and "the date on which the evidence is submitted is irrelevant"). 

In general, under the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, also known as the "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Service connection may also be granted for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). A claim for secondary service connection generally requires competent evidence of a causal relationship between the service-connected disability and the nonservice-connected disease or injury. See Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134 (1994). There must be competent evidence of a current disability; evidence of a service-connected disability; and competent evidence of a nexus between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

As previously noted, in March 2024 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and likely etiology of his erectile dysfunction. See March 2024 C&P Exam (Male Reproductive Organ). At that time, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with erectile dysfunction as of March 2009. Id. In addition, relevant to this claim, the Veteran is service connected for bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of a bladder tumor, effective March 11, 1991. See October 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative. Finally, in April 2024, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was "at least as likely as not ... proximately due to or the result of" the Veteran's service-connected "bladder cancer status post trans urethral resection of bladder tumor." April 2024 C&P Exam (Erectile Dysfunction Secondary Opinion). Therefore, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was a current disability in existence from March 1, 2009, and was proximately related to his service-connected bladder cancer status post transurethal resection of bladder tumor. See Wallin, 11 Vet. App. at 512.

The relevant statute states that a claim for compensation will be based on facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application, and the regulation states that the award of service connection will be date of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). Service connection for the Veteran's erectile dysfunction has been found to be warranted as it was proximately related to his service-connected bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Moreover, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction was reasonably raised by his March 11, 1991, claim for entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer. However, after affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has suffered from erectile dysfunction no earlier than March 2009. The assignment of an effective date of March 1, 2009, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction is therefore granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 1, 2009, but no earlier, for entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ.

In the December 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran asserted that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than December 5, 2023, for the grant of entitlement to SMC based on the loss of use of a creative organ. See December 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

In June 2022 the Veteran submitted a claim, in pertinent part, of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction. See June 2022 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). In a January 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was denied entitlement to service connection for his erectile dysfunction but was granted service connection for bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor effective December 10, 2021. See January 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative. In response, the Veteran requested higher-level review in December 2023. See December 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review. Thereafter, in a July 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction as secondary to his service-connected bladder cancer, effective December 5, 2023, which was identified as "the day VA received [the Veteran's] claim." July 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative. The Veteran was also awarded SMC under 38 C.F.R. § 1114(k) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a) due to loss of use of a creative organ resulting from the Veteran's service-connected erectile dysfunction. Id. Subsequently, following a review of the evidence of record, an October 2024 rating decision granted an earlier effective date of March 11, 1991, for the award of service connection for bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor. See October 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative. The Veteran then asserted entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of SMC due to the loss of use of a creative organ in the December 2024 notice of disagreement which gave rise to this appeal. See December 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

SMC is a special statutory award granted in addition to awards based on the schedular evaluations provided by the diagnostic codes in VA's rating schedule. Claims for SMC, other than those pertaining to one-time awards and an annual clothing allowance, are governed by 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) through (t) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 and § 3.352.

SMC is payable at a specified rate if the Veteran, as the result of a service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a). Erectile dysfunction is tantamount to loss of use of a creative organ. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522. VA policy is to pay special monthly compensation for loss of use of a creative organ whenever a service-connected disease causes loss of erectile power. It must initially be established, however, that the loss of erectile dysfunction is a manifestation of a service-connected disease or injury.

In this case, the appeal for an earlier effective date arises from the grant of SMC for loss of use of a creative organ based on service-connected erectile dysfunction secondary to service-connected bladder cancer. As discussed above, the Board has found that the Veteran is entitled to the assignment of an earlier effective date of March 1, 2009, for the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction. The Board therefore further finds that the Veteran is entitled to the assignment of an earlier effective date of March 25, 2021, for the grant of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ.

3. Entitlement to an increased initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for hypertension under Diagnostic Code 7101.

4. Entitlement to a separate 10 percent disability rating for vertigo under Diagnostic Code 6204.

The Veteran contends that he was entitled to an increased initial disability rating for his service-connected hypertension as his symptomatology was more severe than his current evaluation reflects. He is currently in receipt of 10 percent disability rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6204-7101. See October 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet. Additionally, the Veteran contends that he was entitled to a separate disability rating for his service-connected hypertension as the currently assigned diagnostic code does not compensate him for all of his symptoms. The Board has carefully reviewed the evidence of record and finds that the symptomatology of the Veteran's service-connected hypertension most nearly approximated the criteria for a 10 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 7101 and a separate 10 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6204. The reasons follow.

Where an appeal arises from the original assignment of a disability evaluation following an award of service connection, as here, the severity of the disability at issue is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155. It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. The Rating Schedule is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991). When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all evidence, to the end that decisions will be "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue. Instead, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding a request for an increased disability rating. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

In the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that there was a clear and unmistakable error in the January 2023 rating decision that granted the Veteran service connection for vertigo at an initial 10 percent rating. See March 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative; January 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative. Specifically, the March 2024 rating decision determined that the Veteran's vertigo was a symptom of his hypertension and as a result, the AOJ combined the evaluation of the Veteran's vertigo with the evaluation of his hypertension and assigned an initial 10 percent disability rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6204-7101. See March 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative.

Hyphenated Diagnostic Codes are used when a rating under one Diagnostic Code requires use of an additional Diagnostic Code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. In this case, the AOJ assigned a hyphenated diagnostic code to recognize hypertension (Diagnostic Code 7101) to indicate the Veteran's underlying diagnosis and a peripheral vestibular disorder (Diagnostic Code 6204) as indicating the symptoms.

Diagnostic Code 7101 provides for a 10 percent rating for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

A 20 percent disability rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. A 40 percent disability rating for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more, while 60 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. Id.

Diagnostic Code 6204 provides for a 10 percent rating when the evidence reflects occasional dizziness, and a 30 percent rating when there is dizziness and occasional staggering. A Note following Diagnostic Code 6204 provides that objective findings supporting the diagnosis of vestibular disequilibrium are required before a compensable rating can be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6204.

The terms "predominant," "dizziness," and "staggering" are not defined in the rating criteria. When a regulation includes ambiguous or subjective terms, the Board must define such term. See Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 255 (2018). Furthermore, "[i]n the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning." Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015). Merriam-Webster defines "predominant" to mean "being most frequent or common." Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant, Definition 2 (last visited March 31, 2025). Additionally, "dizzy" is defined as having a whirling sensation in the head with a tendency to fall." Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dizzy, Definition 2a (last visited March 31, 2025). Finally, Merriam-Webster defines "stagger" as "to reel from side to side" or "to rock violently." Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stagger, Definition 1a, 3 (last visited March 31, 2025).

In November 2022 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and severity of his hypertension. See November 2022 C&P Exam (Hypertension). At that time, the Veteran reported that he had a "[history] of [hypertension] for many years," though he was "on medication which has helped." Id. The examiner then indicated that the Veteran's treatment plan included taking continuous medication for hypertension. However, the examiner further indicated that the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic pressure of predominantly 100 or more. On examination, blood pressure was 132/92, 134/94 and 132/94. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with hypertension and noted that the disability did not impact the Veteran's ability to work. 

In this case, there is no documentation that diastolic blood pressure was ever predominantly 110 or more or that systolic blood pressure was ever predominantly 200 or more during the period pertinent to this appeal. Rather, the only blood pressure readings of record during the period on appeal were those taken during the November 2022 VA examination. Moreover, review of the Veteran's treatment records and examination reports reveals blood pressure readings that were consistently well below these thresholds. See November 2022 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (63 pages); November 2022 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (34 pages). However, the Veteran's treatment records indicate that the Veteran had multiple blood pressure readings demonstrating diastolic blood pressure of 100 or higher, including four such readings out of six measurements taken over the course of 13 months. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran has a history during which his diastolic pressure was predominantly 100 or more and which required continuous medication for control. However, the Veteran's blood pressure has not predominantly been shown to be over 110 for diastolic pressure or systolic pressure over 200. Therefore, a rating of 10 percent, but no higher, is warranted.

Additionally, the Board notes that VA's duty to maximize benefits requires it to exhaust all schedular options for rating a disability, including secondary service connection, analogous ratings, and separate ratings under multiple diagnostic codes. See Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162, 167-68 (2019). Notably, vertigo, and any associated dizziness or staggering, is not contemplated by Diagnostic Code 7101. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

When an unlisted condition is encountered it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. When considering rating by analogy, VA may take into consideration the functions affected, the anatomical location, and the symptomatology of the disorders, but may not require that an analogous condition strictly meet the requirements of the chosen code in order to assign a rating. See Webb v. McDonough, 71 F.4th 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

In November 2022 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and severity of any current ear conditions. See November 2022 C&P Exam (Ear Conditions). At that time, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with "[v]ertigo, secondary to [hypertension]." Id. The Veteran then reported a history "of vertigo secondary to [hypertension blood pressure] spikes" which manifested as "a few minutes of dizziness," and "room spinning" which occurred "once a month on average." Id. The VA examiner then noted that the Veteran's vertigo was a peripheral vestibular condition which occurred one to four times per month and lasted less than an hour.

In February 2024 the RO sought and obtained an addendum opinion as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's vertigo. See February 2024 C&P Exam (Addendum). At that time, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's diagnosed vertigo was not a "separate peripheral vestibular disorder" but instead was a "subset symptom of the [Veteran's hypertension]." Id. 

Accordingly, the Board finds the persuasive weight of the evidence is in support of a finding that the Veteran's vertigo symptomatology is a manifestation of his service-connected hypertension. However, as noted above, Diagnostic Code 7101 does not contemplate dizziness. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. Thus, a separate rating by analogy is warranted. See Morgan, 31 Vet. App. at 167-68; Webb, 71 F.4th at 1380.

In this case, the Veteran did not report, nor does the record reflect, that he experienced falls, unsteadiness, reeling, or rocking during the appeal period. However, the Veteran's reports of "dizziness" and a sensation of the "room spinning" comports more closely to the "whirling sensation" associated with "occasional dizziness" under the 10 percent criteria of Diagnostic Code 6204. November 2022 C&P Exam (Ear Conditions); Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dizzy, Definition 2a; 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6204. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran's symptoms of dizziness and a sensation of the "room spinning" are appropriately contemplated by "occasional dizziness" but did not rise to level of "dizziness and occasional staggering" such that a rating in excess of 10 percent is warranted. Id.

In sum, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is in support of a finding that the Veteran's hypertension manifested as requiring continuous medication for control as well as a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more but did not manifest as blood pressure predominantly over 110 for diastolic pressure or over 200 for systolic pressure. Accordingly, an initial disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher, under Diagnostic Code 7101 is warranted. Additionally, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is in support of a finding that the Veteran's hypertension resulted in vertigo which manifested as occasional dizziness but did not manifest as occasional staggering. Accordingly, a separate disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher, under Diagnostic Code 6204 is granted. Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other pertinent issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the record).

5. Entitlement to a TDIU.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a TDIU. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that his service-connected lower back strain with degenerative arthritis of the lumbosacral spine, right sciatic nerve radiculopathy, and bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor, manifest in symptomatology of such severity that the Veteran is prevented from securing or following substantially gainful employment. The Board has carefully reviewed the evidence of record and agrees that an award of TDIU is warranted. The reasons follow. 

A TDIU rating may be assigned upon a showing that a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due solely to impairment resulting from his or her service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). There are minimum disability rating percentages that must be shown for the service-connected disabilities, alone or in combination, to qualify for consideration for a TDIU award under § 4.16(a). Indeed, if there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if instead there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id.

For the purpose of determining whether the Veteran has one disability rated 60 percent disabling, or a combination of disabilities including one rated as 40 percent disabling, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, or of one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable, (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident, (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g. orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric, (4) multiple injuries incurred in action, or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. Id.

When unemployability is shown and the claimant meets the schedular requirements, the Board may award TDIU in the first instance. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Otherwise, the Board may only refer the case to the Director of Compensation Service (Director) for consideration of an extraschedular TDIU. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b); see also Cantrell v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 382, 387 (2017) (noting that when a veteran does not meet the schedular requirements, "the Board may only refer the case to the Compensation Service Director for consideration of extraschedular TDIU").

In determining whether a veteran is unemployable for VA purposes, consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to age or any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19. A veteran need not show 100 percent unemployability in order to be entitled to a TDIU. See Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

The Court has held that the central inquiry in determining whether a veteran is entitled to a TDIU is whether service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. See Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524 (1993). The test of individual unemployability is whether a veteran, as a result of his or her service-connected disabilities alone, is unable to secure or follow any form of substantially gainful occupation which is consistent with his or her educational and occupational experience. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. The Board also notes that the ultimate question of whether a veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is not a medical one; rather, that determination is for the adjudicator. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In sum, to warrant a TDIU, the evidence must show that the claimant is incapable of "performing the physical and mental acts required" to be employed. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

In this case, the Veteran is currently in receipt of compensable ratings for service connection for a lower back strain with degenerative arthritis of the lumbosacral spine rated 10 percent disabling from June 1, 1972, to November 1, 1977, noncompensable from November 1, 1977, to January 31, 1997, and 40 percent disabling thereafter; bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor rated noncompensable from March 11, 1991, to December 10, 2021, and 20 percent disabling thereafter; right sciatic nerve radiculopathy rated 20 percent disabling from June 7, 2022; Tinnitus rated 10 percent disabling from June 7, 2022; and hypertension with vertigo rated 10 percent disabling from August 10, 2022. See October 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet. Additionally, the Veteran is also in receipt of a noncompensable rating for service connection for erectile dysfunction from January 3, 2023. Id. The Veteran's combined disabilities are rated 70 percent disabling. Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. Accordingly, he currently meets the schedular criteria for TDIU. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran is unemployed, having last worked as a manager in September 2010. See February 2025 VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. Additionally, the Veteran has asserted that that his service-connected lower back strain with degenerative arthritis of the lumbosacral spine, right sciatic nerve radiculopathy, and bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation. Id.

In September 2022 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and severity of his service-connected lower back strain with degenerative arthritis of the lumbosacral spine and right sciatic nerve radiculopathy. See September 2022 C&P Exam (Back). At that time, the VA examiner indicated that the Veteran suffered from back pain which resulted in difficulty with heavy lifting, limited range of motion, and difficulty standing or sitting for long periods of time. The VA examiner further indicated that the Veteran experienced right lower extremity moderate intermittent pain.

In November 2022 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and severity of his bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor. See November 2022 C&P Exam (Urinary Tract). At that time, the VA examiner indicated that the Veteran suffered from voiding dysfunction which caused urine leakage and required absorbent material which must be changed less than two times a day. Additionally, the Veteran's voiding dysfunction resulted in increased urinary frequency of every two to three hours during the day and caused him to awaken to void twice a night. Id.

In February 2025 the Veteran submitted a letter from a private physician addressing the impact of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities on his ability to work. See February 2025 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. At that time, the private physician, after interviewing the Veteran and reviewing his complete claims file, indicated that the Veteran "struggles with severe back pain and flare-ups that debilitate him." Id. Moreover, the private physician noted that the Veteran's "back pain impacts his mobility, concentration, motivation and sleep, as well as his ability to complete daily tasks." Id. Additionally, the private physician indicated that "due to [the Veteran's] bladder issues and frequent urination, he stays home mostly and if he has to leave, he needs restrooms readily available." Id. 

The private physician therefore opined that the Veteran was "unable to stand for 15 minutes without needing to lean on something," nor "lift or carry more than 10 pounds." Id. Furthermore, the private physician indicated that the Veteran "would only be able to walk for 15 minutes," which he could only accomplish "slowly and assisted with a cane." Id. The Veteran's use of a cane for ambulation would therefore limit "his ability to hold and carry objects while standing or walking." Id. The Veteran would also only be able to "sit for a total of 30 minutes at a time," as he would "need to be able to alternate between sitting and standing, as well as sitting and laying down." Id. However, even "[w]hile seated, he would experience pain with movement, especially repetitive movement" which would "interrupt his ability to do even sedentary tasks, such as turning to answering a phone, writing, and bending to file paperwork." Id. 

As to the Veteran's non-exertional limitations, the private physician opined that "due to [the Veteran's] constant back pain and frequent urination, he often has difficulty concentrating and staying focused." Id. Additionally, the Veteran's pain and voiding issues caused him to sleep "poorly at night, further degrading his ability to maintain focus, patience, and mental acuity." Id.

In February 2025 the Veteran submitted a letter, dated January 8, 2025, which detailed the functional limitations imposed by his service-connected connected lower back strain with degenerative arthritis of the lumbosacral spine, right sciatic nerve radiculopathy, and bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor. See February 2025 Correspondence. At that time, the Veteran indicated that his back will frequently "give out" forcing him to "lay on the floor for a while to try and get some relief." Id. Additionally, he indicated that he cannot sit for more than "fifteen to twenty minutes" before he has to straighten out his back. Id. Further, the Veteran cannot get into and out of cars, or traverse stairs, without great difficulty and pain. The Veteran also detailed difficulties with controlling his bladder, including frequently needing to use the restroom. This has impacted his ability to sleep throughout the night, which in turn causes him to be "fatigued during the day." Id.

In February 2025 the Veteran submitted an additional letter, written by his wife, which was also dated January 8, 2025. See February 2025 Buddy/Lay Statement. At that time, the Veteran's spouse indicated that "the back pain [the Veteran] struggles with is there all the time." Id. Specifically, the spouse noted the Veteran "is only able to walk short distances" and "sit for about thirty minutes before he has to get up and move around." Id. Additionally, the Veteran's spouse noted that he is unable to "drive for longer periods of time," or lift "[a]nything over fifteen pounds." Id.

Given the above, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is in support of a finding that the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU, as he is functionally "unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation" due to his service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). In particular, the Veteran experienced paralysis and pain in his back and right lower extremity, as well as fatigue and voiding issues. Moreover, the Veteran's pain prevented him from standing, sitting, walking, or driving for extended periods of time. Moreover, the Veteran's pain prevented him from performing even tasks traditionally associated with sedentary employment such as answering a phone, writing, or filing paperwork. It is unrealistic to expect that the Veteran could sustain gainful employment under these circumstances. Therefore, the persuasive weight of the lay and medical evidence of record reflects that the Veteran is most likely not "capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment." Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363. The grant of an award of a TDIU is therefore warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

As to the remaining issues on appeal, remand is warranted.  The Board sincerely regrets the additional delay caused by these remands but wishes to assure the Veteran that it is necessary for a full and fair adjudication of his claims. The reasons follow.

1. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for lower back strain with degenerative arthritis of the lumbosacral spine is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased disability rating in excess of 40 percent for his lower back strain with degenerative arthritis of the lumbosacral spine. Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the appeal must be remanded. The reasons follow.

The Veteran was granted service connection for chronic lumbosacral strain in an October 1972 rating decision with an initial 10 percent disability rating. See October 1972 Rating Decision (e.g. VA Form 21-6796). The Veteran was then granted an increased 40 percent disability rating effective January 13, 1997. See March 1998 Rating Decision - Narrative. In June 2022 the Veteran submitted an additional claim of entitlement to an increased disability rating for his back condition. See June 2022 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). Thereafter, following a review of the evidence of record, the January 2023 rating decision on appeal continued the 40 percent disability rating for the Veteran's lower back condition which had been previously recharacterized as a lower back strain with degenerative arthritis of the lumbosacral spine and evaluated under Diagnostic Code 5242-5237. See January 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative; January 2023 Rating Decision - Codesheet.

In September 2022 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and severity of his thoracolumbar spine disability. See September 2022 C&P Exam (Back). At that time, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with degenerative arthritis. The Veteran then reported that his back condition began in 1971 and had "worsened over the years." Id. Active range of motion testing indicated forward flexion limited to 30 degrees, as well as extension, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right lateral rotation, and left lateral rotation to 15 degrees. Passive range of motion testing was conducted, with no additional loss in range of motion noted. Range of motion testing after three repetitions was conducted, with flexion further limited to 25 degrees, and no change in extension, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right lateral rotation, and left lateral rotation. The VA examiner estimated that the Veteran's functional ability would be limited due to pain and lack of endurance with repeated use over time with flexion limited to 20 degrees, as well as extension, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right lateral rotation, and left lateral rotation to 10 degrees. Additionally, the VA examiner estimated that the Veteran's functional ability would be further restricted during a flare-up, with flexion limited to 15 degrees, as well as extension, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right lateral rotation, and left lateral rotation to 5 degrees.

Pain was noted on active motion and passive motion which the VA examiner indicated caused functional loss. However, the VA examiner reported that the Veteran did not experience pain on weight-bearing or on non-weightbearing. Additionally, there was no evidence of guarding, crepitus, ankylosis, or localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue. Muscle spasms were indicated, resulting in antalgic gait. Further, the report indicated that the Veteran did not make made regular use of assistive devices as a normal mode of location. In terms of functional impact, the examiner noted that the Veteran's back condition made it difficult to perform heavy lifting, as well as to stand or sit for long periods of time. Id.

Unfortunately, the Board finds the September 2022 VA examination inadequate for the following reasons. First, the report appears to be internally inconsistent, at the VA examiner indicates that the Veteran experiences pain, but not on weight-bearing or non-weightbearing. The Board is uncertain, and the September 2022 VA examiner does not otherwise address, how the Veteran could experience pain, which was not present on either weight-bearing or non-weightbearing, as those appear to be the only options. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (medical opinions are regarded as more probative when they include clear conclusions and supporting data with a reasoned analysis connecting the data and the conclusions); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (a medical opinion must clearly "support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").

Additionally, the VA examiner failed to adequately address to what extent the Veteran experienced functional loss due to pain and weakness causing additional disability beyond that reflected on range of motion measurements. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). The VA examiner noted that the Veteran experienced pain on both active and passive motion but did not specify the degree at which the Veteran began to experience pain with each range of motion. See September 2022 C&P Exam (Back).

Furthermore, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran treated his back disabilities with over-the-counter medication and the Veteran had previously reported use of anti-inflammatory medication. See August 1997 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim. However, the VA examiner did not provide any indication as to what effect, if any, the Veteran's medication had on his back symptomatology. The Board notes that where a diagnostic code does not explicitly contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication on a disability, the Board must evaluate the disability without regard to the ameliorative effects of the medication. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 62 (2012); see also McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) ("if [a diagnostic code] does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication, the Board is required pursuant to Jones to discount the ameliorative effects of medication"). The Diagnostic Codes potentially applicable to back disabilities do not explicitly contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5235, 5236, 5237, 5238, 5239, 5240, 5241, 5242, 5243, 5244.

Finally, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran did not suffer from ankylosis of the thoracolumbar spine but failed to address the Veteran's contention that his back frequently "goes out," with severe flare-ups during which he "loses all motion." March 1991 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim; March 2001 VA Examination; see also Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021) (holding that ankylosis can be demonstrated by its functional equivalent-i.e., functional loss consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis); Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249 (2020) (explaining that a VA examination is inadequate if the examiner does not consider lay evidence). The Veteran is competent to report those symptoms observable to a lay person, and the Board finds his assertions to be credible. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The failure of the VA examiner to address the Veteran's lay contentions regarding his symptomatology in any meaningful way therefore renders the analysis insufficient.

Given the above, the Board finds the September 2022 VA examination to be inadequate for the purpose of readjudicating the Veteran's appealed issue. When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). The Board therefore finds that the AOJ's failure to ensure the adequacy of the September 2022 VA examination prior to adjudicating the claim to be a pre-decisional error in the duty to assist that must be corrected on remand. See 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy of the right sciatic nerve is remanded.

In the December 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran asserted that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than June 7, 2022, for the grant of entitlement to a service connection for radiculopathy of the right sciatic nerve. See December 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the appeal must be remanded. The reasons follow.

The Veteran was granted service connection for chronic lumbosacral strain in an October 1972 rating decision with an initial 10 percent disability rating. See October 1972 Rating Decision (e.g. VA Form 21-6796). Thereafter, on August 21, 1997, the Veteran submitted a claim for entitlement to an increased disability rating for his lower back condition. See August 1997 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim. Specifically, the Veteran indicated that he experienced "loss of feeling in [his] legs, sciatic problems, and [his] legs 'go to sleep' frequently." Id. 

In conjunction with the August 1997 claim, the Veteran submitted medical records which indicated that he suffered from pain "in the low lumbar region, in the midline, off the midline more to the right side" which intermittently "radiates down posteriorly into the leg up into the right calf." See August 1997 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. Due to these symptoms, the Veteran's treating physician diagnosed the Veteran with "chronic lower back and bilateral lower extremity pain (worse on the right side)," as well as "chronic lumbar myofascial syndrome," and indicated that "lumbar radiculopathy" would need to be ruled out. Id.

In September 1997, the Veteran was therefore afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and severity of his lower back condition. See September 1997 VA Examination. At that time, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's "'toes feel cold,'" on his left foot. Id. Additionally, the Veteran was noted to suffer from "'tingling' dysthesias of the distal left foot." Id.

The Veteran was then granted an increased 40 percent disability rating effective January 13, 1997. See March 1998 Rating Decision - Narrative. However, the rating decision did not otherwise address the Veteran's reported sciatic problems and possible radiculopathy. Id.

In June 2022 the Veteran again submitted a claim of entitlement to an increased disability rating for his back condition. See June 2022 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). Thereafter, following a review of the evidence of record, the January 2023 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for radiculopathy of the right sciatic nerve effective June 7, 2022. See January 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative; January 2023 Rating Decision - Codesheet. The Veteran then asserted entitlement to an earlier effective date in the December 2024 notice of disagreement which gave rise to this appeal. See December 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

Given the above, the Board finds that the issues of entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy of the right sciatic nerve was reasonably raised in conjunction with the Veteran's August 1997 claim of entitlement to an increased disability rating for his lower back condition. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2) ("[o]nce VA receives a complete claim, VA will adjudicate as part of the claim entitlement to any ancillary benefits that arise as a result of the adjudication decision) (emphasis added); Bailey, 33 Vet. App. at 203 (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2) requires VA "to develop and adjudicate related claims for secondary service connection for disabilities that are reasonably raised during the adjudication of a formally initiated claim for the proper evaluation level for the primary service-connected disability"); see also Grimes, 34 Vet. App. at 84 (holding that "a claim for service connection may encompass a related condition that is initially referenced by the claimant but not diagnosed until later in the appeal stream").

However, the Board notes there is no prior claim of entitlement of service connection for his radiculopathy of the right sciatic nerve prior to August 1997. The Board has thoroughly and sympathetically reviewed the evidence of record and finds the Veteran did not file an informal claim nor a formal claim prior to August 21, 1997, to include as secondary to his lower back condition. Additionally, the Board reiterates that the presence of medical evidence does not establish an intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for that disorder. See MacPhee, 459 F.3d at 1326. In reviewing the evidence of record, it did not show an intent by the Veteran that he was going to file a claim for service connection for his radiculopathy prior to August 21, 1997.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the date of receipt of the initial claim as to the issues of entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy of the right sciatic nerve is August 21, 1997. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). Having so determined, the remaining question before the Board is precisely when it first became factually ascertainable that the Veteran became entitled to receive service connection for his radiculopathy of the right sciatic nerve. Id. The Board again notes that the Court has interpreted the date entitlement arose as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

The evidence of record does not include a competent medical opinion assessing precisely when the Veteran's radiculopathy had its onset. The current effective date of June 7, 2022, corresponds to the Veteran's most recent claim of entitlement to an increased disability rating for his lower back condition. See June 2022 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). Given the evidence discussed above, the Board finds an additional opinion is needed which addresses the entire appeal period. Although the Veteran's treatment records indicate that he experienced radicular symptomatology as early as March 1997, the medical evidence is devoid of a confirmed diagnosis of radiculopathy prior to September 2022. See August 1997 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (16 pages); September 2022 C&P Exam (Back). The Board is unable to make its own, independent medical judgments in this matter. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991); see also Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80, 86 (2008); Vigil v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 63 (2008) (holding that the duty to assist may include development of medical evidence through a retrospective medical evaluation where there is a lack of medical evidence for the relevant time period).

Given the above, the Board finds the AOJ's failure to obtain a medical opinion addressing the entire period on appeal prior to adjudicating the claim to be a pre-decisional error in the duty to assist that must be corrected on remand. See 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).

3. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for radiculopathy of the right sciatic nerve is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for his radiculopathy of the right sciatic nerve. Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the appeal must be remanded. The reasons follow.

As discussed in detail above, the Veteran was granted service connection for right sciatic nerve radiculopathy in the January 2023 rating decision on appeal. See January 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative. The Veteran was assigned an initial 20 percent disability rating effective June 7, 2022. The Veteran then asserted entitlement to an increased initial disability rating in the December 2024 notice of disagreement which gave rise to this appeal. See December 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

In September 2022 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and severity of his thoracolumbar spine disability, to include any associated radiculopathy. See September 202 2 C&P Exam (Back). At that time, the Veteran reported that his condition began in 1971. The VA examiner then diagnosed the Veteran with degenerative arthritis and right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy. No paresthesias, dysesthesias, constant pain, numbness, or loss of muscle strength was noted. Likewise, reflex and sensory examinations results were within normal limits. However, the Veteran was noted to have moderate intermittent pain in his right lower extremity. 

Unfortunately, the Board finds the September 2022 VA examination inadequate for the following reasons. First, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran treated his radiculopathy with over-the-counter pain medications. Moreover, the Veteran has previously reported use of anti-inflammatory medication. See August 1997 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim. However, the VA examiner did not provide any indication as to what effect, if any, the Veteran's medication had on his back symptomatology. The Board notes that where a diagnostic code does not explicitly contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication on a disability, the Board must evaluate the disability without regard to the ameliorative effects of the medication. See Jones, 26 Vet. App. at 62; see also McCarroll, 28 Vet. App. at 271 ("if [a diagnostic code] does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication, the Board is required pursuant to Jones to discount the ameliorative effects of medication"). The Diagnostic Codes potentially applicable to radiculopathy do not explicitly contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

Furthermore, the VA examiner failed to address the notations within the Veteran's medical records which indicated that he experienced pain which intermittently "radiates down posteriorly into the leg up into the right calf," with pain "also felt on the left side." August 1997 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility; see also Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 301 (noting that the "Board must be able to conclude that a medical expert has applied valid medical analysis to the significant facts of the particular case in order to reach the conclusion submitted in the medical opinion").

Additionally, the VA examiner failed to address the Veteran's statement that he experiences "sharp pain radiating into the buttocks and down the posterior of the right leg," along with similar symptoms "on the left leg," although "this is of much less severity." March 2001 VA Examination. Likewise, the VA examiner failed to address the Veteran's assertion that his "left foot 'goes to sleep at times,'" with a "'tingling' dysthesias of the distal left foot" as well as his assertion that "his 'toes feel cold' on the left foot." November 1999 VA Examination; September 1997 VA Examination. Moreover, the VA examiner failed to address the Veteran's contention that his "legs 'go to sleep' frequently," which includes "loss of feeling in [his] legs," as well as "sciatic problems." August 1997 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim; see also Miller, 32 Vet. App. at 249 (explaining that a VA examination is inadequate if the examiner does not consider lay evidence). The Board reiterates that the Veteran is competent to report those symptoms observable to a lay person, and the Board finds his assertions to be credible. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. The failure of the VA examiner to address the Veteran's lay contentions regarding his symptomatology in any meaningful way therefore renders the analysis insufficient.

Given the above, the Board finds the September 2022 VA examination to be inadequate for the purpose of readjudicating the Veteran's appealed issue. When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. See Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 312. The Board therefore finds that the AOJ's failure to ensure the adequacy of the September 2022VA examination prior to adjudicating the claim to be a pre-decisional error in the duty to assist that must be corrected on remand. See 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).

4. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased compensable disability rating prior to December 10, 2021, and an increased disability rating in excess of 20 percent thereafter, for his bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the appeal must be remanded. The reasons follow.

In a January 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor with an initial 20 percent disability rating effective December 10, 2021. See January 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative. Subsequently, following a review of the evidence of record, the October 2024 rating decision on appeal granted an earlier effective date of March 11, 1991, for the award of service connection for bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor with an initial noncompensable disability rating prior to December 10, 2021, and a 20 percent disability rating thereafter. See October 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative. 

In November 2022 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and severity of any current urinary tract conditions. See November 2022 C&P Exam (Urinary). At that time, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with urinary bladder cancer. The Veteran then reported that he was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1974 at which point he underwent a removal of the tumor, with the bladder cancer then subsequently entering into remission. However, the Veteran further reported that following his bladder cancer removal he began to experience residuals including urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and urinary leakage which have not otherwise abated in the years since. Additionally, the Veteran was noted to have been prescribed nightly usage of tadalafil to treat his residual symptoms.

The VA examiner then reported that the Veteran's bladder cancer had resulted in a voiding dysfunction. The voiding dysfunction had manifested as urine leakage which required absorbent material and had to be changed less than two times a day but did not require the use of an appliance. Additionally, the voiding dysfunction caused increased urinary frequency which resulted in daytime voiding intervals between two and three hours as well as nighttime awakenings to void twice a night. Finally, the VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's voiding dysfunction did not cause signs or symptoms of obstructed voiding. Id.

Unfortunately, the Board finds the November 2022 VA examination inadequate for the following reasons. First, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran treated his voiding dysfunction with tadalafil. However, the VA examiner did not provide any indication as to what effect, if any, the Veteran's medication had on his symptomatology. The Board notes that where a diagnostic code does not explicitly contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication on a disability, the Board must evaluate the disability without regard to the ameliorative effects of the medication. See Jones, 26 Vet. App. at 62; see also McCarroll, 28 Vet. App. at 271 ("if [a diagnostic code] does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication, the Board is required pursuant to Jones to discount the ameliorative effects of medication"). The Diagnostic Codes potentially applicable to bladder cancer and associated residuals do not explicitly contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a; 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528.

Given the above, the Board finds the November 2022 VA examination to be inadequate for the purpose of readjudicating the Veteran's appealed issue. When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. See Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 312. The Board therefore finds that the AOJ's failure to ensure the adequacy of the September 2022 VA examination prior to adjudicating the claim to be a pre-decisional error in the duty to assist that must be corrected on remand. See 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a retrospective medical opinion from a clinician with appropriate expertise as to the nature and severity of the Veteran's lower back strain with degenerative arthritis of the lumbosacral spine throughout the entire period on appeal. The clinician should review the entire claims file and include a discussion of the Veteran's documented history and pertinent lay statements and testimony. The clinician must opine as to all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluation of the Veteran's back conditions under the rating criteria as they presented throughout the entire period on appeal from June 7, 2022.

(a.) The clinician must provide an opinion as to the range of motion for pain on BOTH active and passive motion AND on weight bearing and non-weight bearing.

(b.) The clinician must indicate whether the Veteran experienced painful motion, and if so, the point at which pain began during range of motion.

(c.) The clinician must opine as to whether there was any pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, or incoordination on movement, and the degree to which any additional range of motion was lost due to: pain on use, including during flare-ups; weakened movement; excess fatigability; or incoordination.

(d.) The clinician must opine as to whether there are times, to include during flare-ups, when the Veteran's functional loss was consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis; in other words, if the Veteran ever demonstrated functional loss that was the functional equivalent to ankylosis. If the clinician finds that the Veteran's functional loss was equivalent to ankylosis, he or she must opine as to whether the severity of the ankylosis is consistent with unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine, unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine, or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

(e.) The clinician must opine as to whether any medications the Veteran used affected the severity of his back disabilities. If so, the clinician should identify each medication and clearly explain how such medication affected the condition. If any such medication was productive of ameliorative effects, the clinician must clearly identify such effects and opine as to how severe the condition would have been absent such medication, to specifically include whether there would have been any additional pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, or incoordination on movement, or loss of range of motion.

In so doing, the clinician must address the Veteran's noted use of medications to treat his pain and inflammation. See February 2025 Buddy/Lay Statement, p. 1; February 2025 Correspondence, p. 1; September 2022 C&P Exam (Back), p. 2.

The clinician must also address the findings of the September 2022 VA examiner which indicated that during flare-ups the Veteran's forward flexion would be limited to 15 degrees while extension, left lateral rotation, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, and right lateral rotation would each be limited to only 5 degrees. See September 2022 C&P Exam (Back), p. 7. Likewise, the clinician must address the findings of the March 2021 VA examiner that the Veteran "loses all motion" during a severe flare-up. See March 1991 VA Examination, p. 3. Finally. the clinician must also address the Veteran's contention that his back will "give out" causing him to "fall to the ground." See February 2025 Correspondence, p. 1.

Please explain upon what facts, medical principles, and/or medical literature the opinion is based. If the clinician determines that it is not possible to provide such assessments or opinions without first examining the Veteran, the RO should take appropriate steps to schedule the Veteran for an examination. All tests and studies deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.

2. Obtain a retrospective medical opinion from a clinician with appropriate expertise as to the nature and severity of the Veteran's radiculopathy throughout the entire period on appeal. The clinician should review the entire claims file and include a discussion of the Veteran's documented history and pertinent lay statements and testimony. The clinician must opine as to all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluation of the Veteran's radiculopathy under the rating criteria as they presented throughout the entire period on appeal from August 21, 1997. Additionally, the clinician must provide an opinion, with as much specificity as possible, as to the onset date of the Veteran's radiculopathy.

The clinician must opine as to whether any medications the Veteran used affected the severity of his radiculopathy. If so, the clinician should identify each medication and clearly explain how such medication affected the Veteran's condition. If any such medication was productive of ameliorative effects, the clinician must clearly identify such effects and opine as to how severe the condition would have been absent such medication.

In so doing, the clinician must address the radicular symptomatology as documented in the Veteran's treatment records and VA examinations. See August 1997 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility, pp. 3-4; September 1997 VA Examination, pp. 2-3; November 1999 VA Examination, pp. 1-2; March 2001 VA Examination, pp. 2-3; September 2022 C&P Exam (Back), pp. 2, 8-11.

The clinician must also address the radicular symptomatology as reported by the Veteran and his spouse. See March 1991 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim, p. 1; August 1997 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim, p. 1; February 2025 Correspondence, p. 1; February 2025 Buddy/Lay Statement, p. 1.

Finally, the clinician must address the Veteran's noted use of medications to treat his pain and inflammation. See February 2025 Buddy/Lay Statement, p. 1; February 2025 Correspondence, p. 1; September 2022 C&P Exam (Back), p. 2.

Please explain upon what facts, medical principles, and/or medical literature the opinion is based. If the clinician determines that it is not possible to provide such assessments or opinions without first examining the Veteran, the RO should take appropriate steps to schedule the Veteran for an examination. All tests and studies deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.

3. Obtain a retrospective medical opinion from a clinician with appropriate expertise as to the nature and severity of the Veteran's bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor throughout the entire period on appeal. The clinician should review the entire claims file and include a discussion of the Veteran's documented history and pertinent lay statements and testimony. The clinician must opine as to all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluation of the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria as they presented throughout the entire period on appeal from March 11, 1991.

The clinician must opine as to whether any medications the Veteran used affected the severity of his bladder cancer status post transurethral resection of bladder tumor. If so, the clinician should identify each medication and clearly explain how such medication affected the Veteran's condition. If any such medication was productive of ameliorative effects, the clinician must clearly identify such effects and opine as to how severe the condition would have been absent such medication.

In so doing, the clinician must address the clinician must address the Veteran's noted use of medications to treat his voiding dysfunction. See November 2022 C&P Exam (Urinary), p. 2.

Please explain upon what facts, medical principles, and/or medical literature the opinion is based. If the clinician determines that it is not possible to provide such assessments or opinions without first examining the Veteran, the RO should take appropriate steps to schedule the Veteran for an examination. All tests and studies deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.

In providing these opinions, the examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such reports must be considered. If the examiner rejects the Veteran's reports, he or she must provide a reason for doing so.

Rationale for all requested opinions shall be provided. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resorting to mere speculation, he or she shall provide a complete explanation stating why this is so. In so doing, the examiner shall explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that particular question.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
