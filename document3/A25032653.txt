ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2023, for the award of service connection for degenerative joint disease of the thoracolumbar spine (previously denied as low back pain) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a December 2003 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for a back condition. The Veteran did not appeal this determination and the decision became final. 

2. On August 10, 2023, VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection for a back disability. A claim for service connection for a back disability was not received between the December 2003 rating decision and the August 2023 claim for service connection. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date than August 10, 2023, for the award of service connection for degenerative joint disease of the thoracolumbar spine have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 3.400, 20.302, 20.1103.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1999 to November 2003, from September 2007 to August 2010, from October 2015 to October 2016, from July 2017 to July 2018 and from July 2019 to June 2020.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Higher Level Review (HLR) decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In May 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and selected the Direct Review docket. Under the Direct Review Lane, the Board reviews the claim based on the evidence of record available to the AOJ at the time of the decision. As such, the Board will only consider the evidence received as of the rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2023, for the award of service connection for degenerative joint disease of the thoracolumbar spine 

The Veteran contends that an effective date prior to August 10, 2023, for the award of service connection for degenerative joint disease of the thoracolumbar spine is warranted. 

The effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Unfortunately, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an effective date prior to August 10, 2023, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's low back condition. The May 2024 HLR decision that the current effective date was assigned based upon the date that the Veteran's VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) was received by VA, August 10, 2023. An Intent to File was not received within the year prior to the Veteran's formal claim for back disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). As such, August 10, 2023, is the earliest date available for service connection for the Veteran's conditions based upon his August 2023 claim. 

To the extent that the Veteran had previously claimed service connection for a back condition in June 2003, this claim was denied by a December 2003 rating decision. The Veteran was sent notification of this determination in a December 23, 2003, letter. This decision was not appealed and became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 20.1103. The evidence does not indicate that relevant records were received by VA during the appellate period following this denial or that the Veteran requested a good cause extension to appeal this determination; as such, the December 2003 decision did not remain pending. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (b); see Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

The evidence does not indicate that the Veteran submitted a claim to reopen his claim for service connection for a back condition between the December 2003 denial and his August 2023 claim for service connection. As such, without a finding of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) or unless reconsideration under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(1) was proper, entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2023, for service connection for a back condition is not warranted. The evidence does not show that the Veteran's claim was granted due to reconsideration under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c) or based upon relevant official service department records associated with the claims file or received by VA since the December 2003 rating decision. As such an earlier effective date based upon reconsideration under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c) is not warranted. 

The Board notes that a CUE claim regarding the December 2003 rating decision is not associated with the claims file and that a claim for CUE must be pled with specificity. See Andre v. West, 14 Vet. App. 7, 10 (2000). Accordingly, a claim for CUE in relation to the December 2003 rating decision is not before the Board at this time.

In summary, the Board finds an effective date prior to August 10, 2023, for the award of service connection for degenerative joint disease of the thoracolumbar spine is not warranted; accordingly, the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date must be denied. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400, 20.302, 20.1103.
