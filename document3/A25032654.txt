DOCKET NO. 241119-488106
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating of 100 percent for smoldering myeloma from July 14, 2023 is granted, subject to the law and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's smoldering myeloma has been symptomatic within the past five years.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for an initial disability rating of 100 percent for smoldering myeloma from July 14, 2023 are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.10, 4.117, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7712.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1966 to December 1968.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that, after the Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim in September 2024, continued the Veteran's initial noncompensable evaluation for smoldering myeloma.  While the November 2024 rating decision did not specifically state whether new and relevant evidence was received to warrant readjudicating the claim, it readjudicated the merits of all of the claim on appeal.  Thus, to the extent that new and relevant evidence was required, there were implicit favorable findings by which the Board is bound of new and relevant evidence by the RO, and the Board will address the merits of the claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 3.2501.

The Veteran timely appealed the November 2024 rating decision in a November 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) (VA Form 10182) and selected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(b)(1).  Accordingly, the Board will review the evidence of record as of the date of the November 2024 rating decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board will not consider evidence added to the record after the date of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  If evidence was added during any ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  

As a final preliminary matter, the Board generally may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting a docket switch under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) has elapsed.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).   In this regard, 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows claimants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new notice of disagreement within one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives an NOD, whichever is later, unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony.  The timeframe to switch dockets has not passed here.  However, the Board will issue a decision in this case rather than delay adjudication because it finds the Veteran has waived the timeframe for docket switches as a February 2024 Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) indicated that he is terminally ill.  Cf. Clark v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 92, 97-98 (2018) (finding that an appellant's 90-day post-remand period for submission of evidence "exists as a matter of right" and "may not be curtailed absent a voluntary, knowing, and intentional waiver of that right"); Janssen v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2001) ("where the appellant is represented by counsel, whom the Court presumes to be versed in the facts of the case and to know and to understand the law as it relates to those facts, the appellant can waive this Court's consideration of [rights guaranteed to him by an act of Congress, such as the VCAA]," but "in order to do so, the appellant must first possess a right, he must have knowledge of that right, and he must intend, voluntarily and freely, to relinquish or surrender that right").  The fact that the Veteran indicated in his February 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ reflects a desire that his appeal be decided as expeditiously as possible and thus indicates a voluntary, knowing, and intentional waiver of the right to have the Board delay adjudication of his claim until either one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives an NOD, whichever is later, has passed.  As the Veteran desires that the Board issue a decision as quickly as possible, it will act consistent with this desire by adjudicating the claim.

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for smoldering myeloma

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a compensable disability rating for his smoldering myeloma as he is receiving treatment for the condition.

Disability ratings are determined by comparing a Veteran's symptoms with criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which are based on average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher of the two evaluations is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged rating" (assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts found) is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

Symptomatic multiple myeloma is rated 100 percent under DC 7712.  38 C.F.R. § 4.117.  The 100 percent evaluation shall continue for five years after the diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma, at which time the appropriate disability evaluation shall be determined by mandatory VA examination.  Any reduction in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of § 3.105(e) and § 3.344(a) and (b) of this chapter.  Asymptomatic, smoldering, or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is rated noncompensable.  The Veteran is currently in receipt of an initial noncompensable evaluation for smoldering myeloma from July 14, 2023, the date of an Intent to File and has continuously pursued the claim in the AMA from that date.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

For the following reasons, an initial disability rating of 100 percent for smoldering myeloma is warranted.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in June 2024 where the VA examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with smoldering myeloma in 2023.  During the examination, the Veteran reported current symptoms of fatigue, anemia, and continuous treatment with medications.  He also indicated that his condition had stayed the same since onset.  The VA examiner found that the Veteran's smoldering myeloma was active but did not impact his ability to work.

An August 2024 VA treatment record noted the Veteran's worsening anemia, a free light chain (FLC) ratio that was not improving, and the Veteran's use of multiple medications to treat his smoldering myeloma.

During a VA examination in September 2024, the Veteran reported weekly chemotherapy for his smoldering myeloma and endorsed symptoms of anemia, whole body pain, diarrhea, occasional constipation, and poor energy and appetite.  Continuous medication was required for control of his condition.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's smoldering myeloma was active with ongoing therapeutic treatment.  Also, his condition impacted his ability to work in that his chemotherapy and symptoms caused fatigue and interfered with daily activities.

The evidence of record as discussed above reflects that the Veteran's smoldering myeloma has been symptomatic within the past five years.  Specifically, the Veteran has been taking multiple medications to treat his myeloma symptoms since his diagnosis in 2023 and underwent weekly chemotherapy.  Further, he experienced fatigue, anemia, whole body pain, diarrhea, occasional constipation, and poor energy and appetite as a result of his myeloma.  

For the above reasons, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether a 100 percent disability rating for the Veteran's smoldering myeloma is warranted from July 14, 2023, the date of his Intent to File.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to an initial disability rating of 100 percent for smoldering myeloma is warranted from July 14, 2023.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. 

The Board has considered the Veteran's claim and decided entitlement based on the evidence.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, to include entitlement to a separate disability rating or extraschedular disability rating, entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), or service connection secondary to a disability.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
