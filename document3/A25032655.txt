REMANDED

Entitlement to an extension of the delimiting date for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (Post-9/11 GI Bill), beyond March 2, 2023, is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2003 to September 2004 and from October 2004 to March 2008.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2022 decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The RO determined that the Veteran was not entitled to an extension of her delimiting date for Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) benefits. 

In the May 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to an extension of the delimiting date for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33, is remanded.

An individual is eligible for Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) educational assistance if, among other things, commencing on or after September 11, 2001, he or she serves an aggregate of at least 90 days on active duty in the Armed Forces (excluding entry level and skill training), and continues on active duty. 38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520. In this case, the Veteran's basic eligibility for Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits is not in dispute. Rather, the dispute concerns whether the Veteran is entitled to a further extension of the delimiting date for those benefits.

Except as otherwise provided, a veteran's period of eligibility for Post 9/11 GI Bill educational assistance will terminate effective 15 years from the date of the last discharge or release from active duty of at least 90 continuous days (or 30 continuous days if the veteran is released for a service-connected disability). 38 C.F.R.§ 21.9530. In this case, the Veteran was last discharged from qualifying active duty for Chapter 33 purposes on March 1, 2008; as such, the original delimiting date for her use of Chapter 33 benefits was March 2, 2023.

The Board is cognizant that the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, Pub. L. 115-48, also known as the Forever GI Bill, provides for the elimination of the 15-year delimiting date for Chapter 33 education benefits. However, that provision is only applicable to veterans whose service ended on or after January 1, 2013. As noted, the Veteran's qualifying period of active service ended in March 2008. Consequently, those provisions are not applicable.

The period of eligibility for Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) educational benefits may be extended under the circumstances enumerated in 38 U.S.C. §§ 3031(b) through (d), as referenced in 38 U.S.C. § 3321(b). See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3321(b); 3031(b) (change in nature of discharge), (c) (detention by a foreign government), (d) (existence of physical or mental disability). As an initial matter, the Board notes that the evidence available for review does not reflect, nor does the Veteran contend, that there has been a change in the nature of her discharge or that she was detained by a foreign government. The record also does not show, and the Veteran does not assert, that she was acting as the primary provider of personal care services for a veteran during her period of eligibility. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3031(d), 3321(b).

Rather, the Veteran's request for an extension of her delimiting date is based on disability; specifically, impairment due to the pregnancy and birth of a child. In an email regarding this extension request, she provided details of the difficulties she experienced prior to and following the birth of her son in March 2019. Due to her advanced maternal age, she had a high-risk pregnancy and experienced complications from her son's birth. In addition, her son had medical conditions while in utero as well as postpartum, which lead to many appointments both during and after the Veteran's pregnancy. The Veteran requested an extension of her delimiting date for either one year or nine months and one week, to complete her Doctor of Education in Educational Leadership. The Veteran also submitted a copy of a May 2022 Extension of Ending Date Attachment, in which a family medicine doctor stated that the Veteran's disability prevented her from training or going to school from June 1, 2018, to March 28, 2019. Notably, the private physician found that the Veteran had her advanced maternal age, high risk pregnancy, and post-birth recovery rendered her disabled. See Education - General, p. 656. In a separate evaluation by the same private physician, she found that the Veteran was disabled from June 1, 2018, to September 30, 2019, on the basis of the aforementioned conditions and for the monitoring and treatment of her son during pregnancy and postpartum. See Education-General, p. 17.

Under applicable law, VA will extend a veteran's period of eligibility if "medical evidence clearly establishes" that the veteran was prevented from initiating or completing his or her program of education within the original period of eligibility because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from his or her own willful misconduct, and if the veteran applies for the extension within a specified time limit. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9535(a)(1). VA will not consider a veteran's disability for a period of 30 days or less as having prevented the veteran from initiating or completing a chosen program, unless the evidence establishes that the veteran was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program or was forced to discontinue attendance due to the short-term disability. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9535(a)(1). A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be for the length of time that he or she was prevented from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9535(a)(2).

VA policy provisions direct that with respect to extension of delimiting dates for disability, medical infeasibility to pursue training ordinarily may not be found for any period during which the claimant was employed full time unless the medical evidence indicates that the employment was part of a medically prescribed rehabilitation program; the employment was of a marginal nature and the disability can reasonably be deemed to have restricted the claimant from concurrent pursuit of the chosen program of training; or the nature of the disability actually precluded the claimant from pursuing the desired program of training. See, e.g., VA Policy Manual M21-1, Part XIII, Subpart I, Chapter 1, Section C-Ratings to Extend the Delimiting Date for Educational Assistance.

The Board notes that the Veteran's employment history during the alleged disability period, June 1, 2018, to September 30, 2019, is not associated with the claims file. Further, there is no indication that the AOJ attempted to obtain the Veteran's employment information

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, VA must "make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claimant's claim for a benefit under a law administered by the Secretary." 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(a)(1); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c) (obligating VA to obtain relevant records from Federal department or agency). The Board notes that the Veteran's employment history related to the June 1, 2018, to September 30, 2019, time period is relevant to whether a delimiting date extension may be warranted, as 38 C.F.R. § 21.9535 provides that VA will grant an extension of the period of eligibility if "medical evidence clearly establishes that the individual was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the original period of eligibility because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the individual's willful misconduct." 38 C.F.R. § 21.9535(a)(1)(ii).

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802, the Board may remand for correction of a pre-decisional duty to assist error, or for any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. Additionally, decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record pursuant to applicable statute and regulation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(d), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).

As there is no indication that the AOJ attempted to obtain relevant employment history and because the decision on appeal is not of record, the Board finds that the AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error and also failed to ensure that all necessary evidence was of record for review by the Board. Accordingly, a remand is necessary in this case. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Conduct any development needed to identify and verify the Veteran's employment history. This includes but is not limited to acquiring authorization from Veteran for employers to complete VA Form 21-4192.

A copy of this decision must be included in the Veteran's claims file.
