CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a right knee condition are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for a left knee condition are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for a neck condition are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2017 to August 2021, including service in the Southwest Asia theater during the Gulf War.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from March 2023 and April 2023 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 and April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral shoulder conditions, a spine condition, a gastrointestinal condition, and an acquired psychiatric disorder, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic (reliably diagnosed) in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Sensorineural hearing loss is a chronic disease.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim, with the veteran prevailing, or whether the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition is granted.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a neck condition is granted.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for bilateral knee conditions and a neck condition. 

In a March 2023 rating decision, the RO favorably found that the Veteran has current diagnoses for bilateral knee strains and a cervical strain. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

In January 2023, the Veteran was afforded VA knee and cervical spine examinations. He reported that his neck pain onset during service due to carrying a heavy machine gun while in service, as his military occupational specialty was Machine Gunner. The Veteran also stated his bilateral knee pain onset in service due to hiking while carrying his heavy machine gun.

The RO requested that the January 2023 VA examiner provide Gulf War medical nexus opinions addressing whether the Veteran's knee and cervical spine strains are either a diagnosable chronic multi-symptom illness with a partially explained etiology; or a disease with a clear and specific etiology and whether it is related to a specific exposure event experienced by the Veteran during service in Southwest Asia. The VA examiner determined that there are clear and specific etiologies and diagnoses for the Veteran's claimed knee and cervical spine conditions, but there are no specific injuries or exposures noted that are specific to the Southwest Asia theater of operations that can cause musculoskeletal injuries such as knee and cervical strains. The VA examiner stated that musculoskeletal injuries are more often than not caused by wear and tear and/or excessive use while in service in the military. 

Examination reports must be read as a whole, and in reading the physical examination report and the Veteran's provided lay statements in conjunction with the medical opinions, the Board concludes that the wear and tear the examiner referenced in the opinion is the wear and tear during military service that the Veteran described to the examiner. See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 105-07 (2012). Although the VA examiner was not asked to provide a direct service connection opinion, the Board places probative weight on the provided opinion as it reflects adequate consideration of the Veteran's statements and military history.

Accordingly, the Board finds that after resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his bilateral knee strains and cervical strain are related to his active duty service and service connection is warranted. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran asserts he is entitled to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

Impaired hearing will be considered a disability for VA purposes when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

After reviewing the evidence, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes and has not had bilateral hearing loss at any time during the pendency of the claim. In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Veteran was afforded a VA hearing loss examination in January 2023. However, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's pure tone thresholds could not be tested, but his Maryland CNC Test results were 100 percent for each ear.  Specifically, the VA examiner stated that the directions for completing pure tone air and bone conduction thresholds were repeated multiple times, but the pure tone air and bone conduction threshold averages did not agree with speech reception thresholds (SRTs) for both ears. The VA examiner determined that the results were not valid for VA rating purposes.

The Veteran was afforded another VA hearing loss examination in March 2023, during which his bilateral ear pure tone thresholds, in decibels (dB), were as follows:

	HERTZ

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	20	15	10	10

LEFT	20	25	20	35	35

The Veteran's Maryland CNC Test results were 94 percent for each ear.

These results show, and the VA examiner noted, that the Veteran does not have current bilateral hearing loss disability for VA purposes. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The Board finds that the March 2023 VA examination is competent, credible, and probative. The examination report also confirms the examiner conducted a review of the Veteran's medical records as part of the assessment. There is no indication within the service treatment records or post-service medical records that the Veteran was noted to have bilateral hearing loss.

Thus, based on a review of the entire record, the Board finds the evidence weighs persuasively against the Veteran's claim. As such, the Veteran's appeal for service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable. See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 at 53-56 (1990).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the RO to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the RO decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other RO error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

When VA undertakes to obtain an examination or opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). A medical examination or opinion is considered adequate "where it is based on consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and examinations and also describes the disability, if any, in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one." Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder condition is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a back condition is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for bilateral shoulder conditions, a back condition, and GERD. 

In a March 2023 rating decision, the RO favorably found that the Veteran has current diagnoses for bilateral shoulder strains and a lumbosacral strain. The RO also favorably found in an April 2023 rating decision that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of GERD. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

In January 2023, a VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's bilateral shoulder strains, lumbosacral strain, and GERD were incurred in or caused by service. As rationale, the VA examiner merely stated that the review of the claims file revealed no in-service treatment for the shoulders, back, or GERD.

The Board finds the January 2023 VA examination opinions are inadequate for adjudication purposes, constituting a duty to assist error. The single-sentence rationale in support of the opinions solely relies on a lack of in-service contemporaneous objective evidence and fails to acknowledge the Veteran's lay statements provided at the VA examinations about the onset of his symptoms. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). 

The VA examination reports show the Veteran related his shoulder and back pain to carrying a heavy machine gun while in service. The Board notes that service treatment records show he reported having shoulder and back pain in March 2021. The Veteran also reported that his GERD symptoms onset in service in 2018, and he treated the condition himself with over-the-counter medication.

Remand is required to obtain new, adequate opinions. 

5. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is remanded.

Lastly, the Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. 

The Board is bound by the favorable finding in the March 2023 that the Veteran has a current diagnosis for insomnia disorder, persistent, based on the findings in a January 2023 VA examination report. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

However, a medical nexus opinion was not obtained. Remand is required to correct this duty to assist error. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's right and left shoulder strains are at least as likely as not related to service. 

2. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's back strain is at least as likely as not related to service. 

3. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's GERD is at least as likely as not related to service. 

4. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's insomnia disorder is at least as likely as not related to service.

5. The VA examiners are advised that sufficient rationale must be provided for each opinion, and that a negative opinion may not be solely based on a lack of in-service treatment of the claimed conditions. The Veteran's lay statements must also be considered and discussed.
