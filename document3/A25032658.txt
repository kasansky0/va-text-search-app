FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the period on appeal, the Veteran does not have symptoms or a disabling condition of dizziness and giddiness for which service connection may be granted.

2. The Veteran's alopecia has not caused loss of all body hair.

3. The Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis has manifested with dry and flaking skin involving less than 5 percent of the entire body or exposed areas affected, and has not required intermittent systemic therapy or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration for more than 6 weeks or more over the past 12-month period.

4. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's neck disability has manifested with forward flexion of the cervical spine limited less than 15 degrees; and, with the combined range of motion of the cervical spine less than 170 degrees; and, without muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.

5. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's back disability has manifested without favorable or unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the functional equivalent thereof.

6. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's gastroesophageal disability has manifested with dysphagia, but without persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, or substernal or arm or shoulder pain, and it is not productive of considerable impairment of health.

7. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's left ovarian cyst has manifested without symptomatology and does not require continuous treatment.

8. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's uterine fibroid has manifested without symptomatology and does not require continuous treatment.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from January 2021 to September 2023.

The two rating decisions on appeal were issued in October 2023, and they constitute initial decisions.  Therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran referenced the October 2023 decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, for the issues of service connection for dizziness and giddiness, and increased disability ratings for alopecia, seborrheic dermatitis, cervical strain, degenerative disc disease, left ovarian cyst, and uterine fibroid, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 13, 2023, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  For those issues, if the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after October 13, 2023, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

For the issue of an increased disability rating for dysphagia, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 25, 2023, AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  For that issue, if the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after October 25, 2023, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

However, because the Board is remanding the issue of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this matter. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  In order to establish entitlement to service connection, there must generally be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) causal connection between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be established for a current disability on the basis of a presumption that certain chronic diseases, to include organic diseases of the nervous system, manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after service must have had their onset in service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a).  For organic diseases of the nervous system, the disease must have manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3). 

If there is no manifestation within one year of service, service connection for a recognized chronic disease can still be established through continuity of symptomatology.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (2013).  Continuity of symptomatology requires the chronic disease to have manifested in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  In-service manifestation means a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings.  Id.

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  38 U.S.C § 1154(a).  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In making a determination, the Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate determinations of competence, credibility, and weight.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, all reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Service connection for dizziness and giddiness is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for dizziness and giddiness.  

STRs show that in February 2021, the Veteran sought treatment for dizziness and giddiness after a full day of standing for long periods, then being dressed in cold weather gear to await an accountability check inside of a crowded building. Military clinicians gave her the opportunity to take off some of the cold weather gear, and to cool, hydrate, and have juice to support possible low blood sugar (noting the Veteran had also had a late meal).  Light duty was authorized for one day.  They noted she recovered well.  Thereafter, dizziness and giddiness appeared in the Veteran's problem list in medical records.  See August 2022 STR, pp. 414-417 (2/10/2021).

At a series of VA examinations in October 2022, examiner completed standardized disability benefits questionnaire forms for chronic fatigue syndrome, heart problems, and ear conditions (including vestibular and infectious conditions).  Dizziness was not observed as an active symptom on any of those examination report forms.  On the form for vestibular ear conditions, the examiner indicated that form was completed specifically for the dizziness and giddiness claim.  The examiner annotated the Veteran's description of the incident in February 2021.  The Veteran reported there had been no reoccurrence, and that there were no current symptoms related to that incident.  The Veteran had a normal examination regarding dizziness.  The examiner observed normal tympanic membrane and ear canal, and other testing regarding dizziness yielded normal results.  See October 2022 Compensation and Pension (C&P) Examinations.

It should be noted that in November 2023-after the rating decision on appeal was issued-the Department of the Navy issued a Department of Defense (DD) Form 2964, Service Treatment Record (STR) Certification.  The form states that after searching with all due diligence, the Navy determined that Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Veteran's STRs were missing.  When STRs are missing, VA has a heightened duty to assist the Veteran in developing his/her claims.  Cromer v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 215, 217-218 (2005).

Here, the Board finds that the existing STRs in the record satisfy VA's duty to assist in developing this claim.  Specifically, the records in the claim file include the records of treatment from February 2021.  Further, the Veteran reported to the VA examiner in October 2022 that there had not been reoccurrence of the symptoms, and that there was no present symptomatology.  Thus, the Board concludes that the available records are sufficient to decide this claim even though some STRs may still indeed be missing from the claim file.

The weight of competent and probative evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran has had symptomatology of dizziness and giddiness, or a disabling condition manifesting with dizziness and giddiness, during the period on appeal.  Thus, the first element of service connection-a presently disabling condition-is not satisfied.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.  

As most of the evidence weighs against the claim (that is to say, is neither in approximate balance nor nearly equal), the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable and the claim must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (rating schedule).  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where a veteran is appealing the rating for an already established service-connected condition, the present level of disability is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  A veteran is presumed to be seeking the maximum possible evaluation.  AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993).  Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

2. Alopecia

3. Seborrheic dermatitis

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating for service-connected alopecia, which is rated 0 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7899-7831.  The Veteran also seeks an increased rating for seborrheic dermatitis, rated 0 percent disabling under DC 7806.

Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen.  Unlisted disabilities requiring rating by analogy will be coded by the numbers of the most closely related body part and 99.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  Here, DC 7899 refers to an unlisted skin disorder, and DC 7831 is for alopecia areata.  

DC 7806 rates dermatitis or eczema, and it instructs to follow the General Rating Formula for the Skin.  Under the General Rating Formula for the Skin, a noncompensable (0 percent) rating is warranted for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period, and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or, at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or, intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA (psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or Systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  A maximum rating of 60 percent is warranted for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or Constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-motnh period.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

DC 7830 provides additional ratings for scarring alopecia, but such is not shown in this case.

DC 7831 rates alopecia areata, and it allows for a 10 percent disability rating for alopecia areata with loss of all body hair.  For hair loss limited to the scalp and face, a 0 percent rating is provided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7831.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for skin conditions in September 2022.  The examiner diagnosed alopecia, unspecified, noting it had affected the head, causing hair loss since onset in about 2021.  The examiner also diagnosed seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, which onset in about 2021, and for which the Veteran reported improvement with the use of topical Nizoral shampoo for the scalp.  However, there was no use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications, retinoids, biologics, or antihistamines.  The Veteran had not had any treatments or procedures other than topical medications in the past 12 months.  The Veteran's two conditions were each indicated to affect less than 5 percent of total exposed area (face, neck and hands).  The examiner described the conditions as patches of thinning hair and white flakes on the scalp.  There were no tumors or neoplasms, and there was no scarring or disfigurement.  There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms.  The examiner indicated there was no functional impact due to the conditions.  See October 2022 C&P Examination.  

Other medical records associated with the claim file show a history of treatment as described by the Veteran above.  No other clinician has evaluated the severity of the condition in terms of percentage of skin affected, nor is there any other indication of medicine or treatment.  Thus, the VA examiner's competent and credible report is the most probative evidence in assessing the level of the Veteran's skin conditions.  

The Board concludes that a compensable rating is not warranted for dermatitis.  The evidence is persuasive against finding that the Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis has manifested with characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent or more of the entire body or exposed areas affected; or, intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA (psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks or more over the past 12-month period.  Thus, the criteria for a compensable disability rating have not been met for seborrheic dermatitis under the General Rating Formula for the Skin.

Additionally, the evidence is persuasive against finding that the Veteran's alopecia, unspecified, has manifested to cause loss of all body hair.  Thus, a compensable rating does not result for that condition under DC 7831.

As most of the evidence weighs against the claims (that is to say, is neither in approximate balance nor nearly equal), the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable and the claims for increased ratings must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

4. Cervical strain

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating for her service-connected cervical strain, presently rated 10 percent disabling under DC 5237, which follows the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 40 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine to 15 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.  A 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id. at Note 1. 

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

At a VA examination of the Veteran's neck in September 2022, the examiner diagnosed a cervical strain.  The Veteran reported gradual onset of intermittent neck pain during service, which had generally stayed the same since onset.  She had been prescribed a muscle relaxer which was noted to improve pain while she used it.  She also took over-the-counter ibuprofen.  The Veteran described increased pain with lifting heavy objects and with running.  She did not report flare-ups.  The Veteran had full range of motion in all tested directions in both active and passive testing: forward flexion to 45 degrees; extension to 45 degrees; right and left lateral flexion to 45 degrees each; and right and left lateral rotation to 80 degrees each.  The examiner observed in forward flexion and extension, and in weight bearing, and upon active and passive motion.  The examiner indicated the pain itself resulted in functional loss.  Based on procured evidence, including statements from the Veteran, the examiner indicated that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance and incoordination would not significantly limit functional ability with repeated use over time.  Muscle strength, reflex and sensory testing were normal.  There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, symptoms or scars.  See October 2022 C&P Examination.

Other medical records associated with the claim file generally show complaints of neck pain, but there are no indications of limitations of motion.

The Board has considered the ameliorative effects of the Veteran's prescribed muscle relaxers and use of over-the-counter ibuprofen.  However, in this case, the Veteran has not reported any flare-ups of her condition, and moreover, no restriction of range of motion is shown in the record at all.  The Veteran's assigned 10 percent disability rating has been based on the examiner's indication of functional impairment due to pain.  The Veteran reported that the prescribed muscle relaxer did reduce pain upon use, and the Board presumes the same is true of the over-the-counter pain relievers.  However, because the Veteran's range of motion has been measured full in all directions, and because the Veteran has not reported restricted motion after use over time and did not report flare-ups, there is no indication in the record that range of motion would be further restricted without the use of medications.  Therefore, the ameliorative effects of medications are not shown in this record to have any impact on functional impairment beyond reduction of pain.  The Veteran's restrictions of motion do not more closely approximate the criteria for a 20 percent rating, with or without medications.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasive against finding that the Veteran's neck disability has manifested with forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees; or, with the combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees; or, with muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis, during the period on appeal, including with consideration of the ameliorative effects of her medications.  Accordingly, the criteria for a higher rating are not more closely approximated by the evidence.  As most of the evidence weighs against the claim (that is to say, is neither in approximate balance nor nearly equal), the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable and the claim must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

5. Degenerative disc disease with degenerative arthritis, thoracolumbar spine (claimed as back condition) 

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating for degenerative disc disease with degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine, which is rated 40 percent disabling throughout the appeal period under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5242.

DC 5242 rates degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS).  It follows the General Rating Formula for the Spine, laid out above in discussion of the Veteran's cervical strain condition.  In order for a rating higher than 40 percent to result under the General Rating Formula, there must be unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  The Board will also consider other applicable diagnostic codes.

STRs associated with the claim file show that the Veteran's back pain manifested with right side sciatic radiculopathy (also called sciatica) since approximately January 2023.  See, e.g., October 2023 JLV / MTF, pp. 21 (8/16/2023), 35 (3/8/2023) (describing sciatica pain for the past 3 months).  Prior to that time, the records show a history of back pain with a herniation at L3-L4, disc bulge at L4-L5, and another small herniation at L5-S1.  See August 2022 STR, p. 2 (1/24/2022).  However, STRs do not show any ankylosis.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2022.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's degenerative condition did not include any ankylosis of the spine, either favorable or unfavorable.  See October 2022 C&P Examination, p. 14.

No other medical records show ankylosis at any time.  Thus, the Veteran's manifestations of degenerative disc disease do not more closely approximate the criteria for a 50 percent disability rating, to include the functional equivalent of ankylosis, under the General Rating Formula.  In this regard, the Veteran had full range of motion and functional impact of 0-1 week of work time lost in the last 12 months and increased pain with prolonged standing, walking, and sitting.  Furthermore, as IVDS has not been shown in this case, a rating under DC 5243 is inappropriate.

As most of the evidence weighs against the claim (that is to say, is neither in approximate balance nor nearly equal), the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable and the claim for a rating greater than 40 percent for the back condition must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The matter of service connection for right-side sciatic radiculopathy will be addressed in the remand section of this decision, below.

6. Dysphagia

The Veteran has appealed the initial assignment of a non-compensable disability rating for dysphagia.  After the Veteran's appeal, the rating has been increased to 10 percent throughout the entire appeal period, rated as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with dysphagia, under DC 7399-7346.

DC 7399 refers to an unlisted digestive disorder.  DC 7346 rates hiatal hernia. 

Prior to May 19, 2024, GERD was not specifically listed in the rating schedule. Therefore, GERD was rated by analogy to 38 C.F.R. §4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346, for hiatal hernia.  Under DC 7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.  The maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

Absent an express definition, it is presumed that VA regulations employ words using their ordinary dictionary meanings at the time the regulations were promulgated.  See Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 805-06 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (stating that when terms are not defined, it is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that they are deemed to have their ordinary meaning).  The Board uses Merriam-Webster's dictionary and employs the meanings found there.  The diagnostic criteria do not define "considerable" or "severe."  For reference, "considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree." Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, available at: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/considerable.  "Severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful."  Id., available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe.

In assigning a rating under old DC 7346, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  Additionally, the rating criteria of DC 7346 are not successive or cumulative with that of the lower rating.  See Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152, 155 (2009); see also Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470, 472 (2006) (recognizing that disabilities rated by analogy will not show all objective criteria of the analogous rating).

Effective May 19, 2024, DC 7346 instructs to rate as stricture of the esophagus (DC 7203).  Also, effective May 19, 2024, the rating schedule now specifically lists GERD under DC 7206.  Under both DC 7203 and DC 7206, a noncompensable rating is warranted for a documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptotic.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than two times per year.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement.  Finally, an 80 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture(s) or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube).  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DCs 7203, 7206.

Generally, if a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110.

In this case, the evidence window the Board can consider is limited to evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, which is dated October 25, 2023.  Therefore, because the rating schedule changed after the evidentiary window closed, there is no evidence to consider under the new criteria.  However, as the Board views the rating period on appeal as continuing until this decision is issued, the Board will address the new criteria.

At the Veteran's September 2022 VA examination, the examiner diagnosed dysphagia.  The Veteran reported onset of symptoms in 2021, including difficulty swallowing foods and liquids, feeling like her throat was tight and dry.  Symptoms had remained approximately the same since onset.  The examiner checked a block to indicate symptoms of dysphagia, but did not indicate listed symptoms of epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, pain, sleep disturbance, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, melena with anemia, or any symptoms productive of considerable or severe impairments of health.  The Veteran did not have an esophageal stricture, spasm, or diverticula.  There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, symptoms or scars.  A November 2021 flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy had shown no masses, ulcers, or lesions; the epiglottis appeared normal; the right arytenoid appeared to be pulled forward or was previously dislocated; however, there was good closure of the vocal folds.  The Veteran did not have any tumors or neoplasms.  The examiner assessed that there was no functional impact due to dysphagia.  See October 2022 C&P Examination. 

No other evidence of record during the appeal period discusses the Veteran's dysphagia symptoms in any matter that contradicts the VA examiner's report, and thus the competent and credible report is the most probative evidence of record for assessing the severity of the Veteran's disability.

A higher rating of 30 percent is not available under the old criteria of DC 7346, because the evidence does not show persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.  Instead, only one of these symptoms (dysphagia) has been shown in the record, and the higher rating would not be appropriate.  Similarly, a higher rating would not result under the new criteria under DCs 7203 and 7206, because the evidence does not show history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than two times per year.  Indeed, as no medication has been indicated for the condition, the criteria for a compensable rating were not met under the amended criteria.  Because the Veteran indicated not taking medications for the condition, the Board need not consider the ameliorative effects of medication.

As most of the evidence weighs against the claim (that is to say, is neither in approximate balance nor nearly equal), the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable and the claim for a rating greater than 10 percent for dysphagia must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

7. Left ovarian cyst 

8. Uterine fibroid 

The Veteran seeks increased disability ratings for her service-connected left ovarian cyst, and uterine fibroid.  The Veteran has been assigned non-compensable ratings under diagnostic code 7621-7613.  She has also been assigned a non-compensable rating under DC 7615 and DC 7632 for female sexual arousal disorder related to the left ovarian cyst with dysmenorrhea, which the Board will consider with her claims for increased disability ratings for uterine fibroid and left ovarian cyst.  The Veteran is also in receipt of special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) for loss of use of a creative organ, throughout the period on appeal.  The Board will consider all potentially applicable diagnostic codes.

DC 7621 provides for a single 10 percent rating for complete or incomplete pelvic organ prolapse due to injury, disease, or surgical complications of pregnancy.  A Note to DC 7621 states that Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when a pelvic organ such as bladder, urethra, uterus, vagina, small bowel, or rectum drops (prolapse) from its normal place in the abdomen.  Conditions associated with pelvic organ prolapse include: uterine or vaginal vault prolapse, cystocele, urethrocele, rectocele, enterocele, or any combination thereof.  The Note further instructs to evaluate pelvic organ prolapse under DC 7621, and to evaluate separately any genitourinary, digestive, or skin symptoms under the appropriate diagnostic code, and combine all evaluations with the 10 percent evaluation under DC 7621.  

DCs 7210 through 7615 follow the General Rating Formula for Disease, Injury, or Adhesions of Female Reproductive Organs.  Under the General Rating Formula, a 0 percent rating is assigned for symptoms that do not require continuous treatment.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for symptoms that require continuous treatment.  A maximum rating of 30 percent is assigned for symptoms not controlled by continuous treatment.

DC 7632 provides for a separate non-compensable (0 percent) rating for female sexual arousal disorder.  

STRs show that the Veteran had a uterine fibroid, simple cyst, identified by ultrasound in January 2022.  See August 2022 STR, p. 3 (1/24/2022).  In April 2022, she underwent follow-up, where the clinician documented difficulty sleeping, cramping in the bladder, and irregular periods.  The Veteran's periods had stopped entirely, but they began again with medication.  See August 2022 STR, p. 2 (4/8/2022).

At the Veteran's September 2022 VA examination, the examiner diagnosed a uterine fibroid, left ovarian cyst, and amenorrhea, which was noted to be resolved.  The Veteran reported having had a pelvic ultrasound which showed the uterine fibroid and left ovarian cyst, consistent with STRs.  She reported being prescribed Provera for 10 days and that caused her menstrual cycle to start again.  She reported getting a monthly cycle since that time.  The examiner documented symptoms of irregular menstruation.  There was no indication of pain or other symptomatology.  The Veteran did not require current treatment.  There were no conditions of the vulva or clitoris, of the vagina, or of the cervix.  There was no history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy.  Although a left ovarian cyst was indicated, the examiner checked a block to indicate there was no evidence of atrophy of 1 or both ovaries.  There was no history of incontinence, nor fistulae, nor endometriosis.  The examiner indicated there was no pelvic organ prolapse due to injury, disease, or surgical complications of pregnancy.  There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, symptoms, or scars.  Imaging from January 2022 had shown a 1.4 cm fibroid, and a 2.7 cm simple cyst at the left ovary.  The examiner indicated the conditions did not impact the Veteran's ability to work.  See October 2022 C&P Examination.  

No evidence of record contradicts the examiner's findings, and thus the competent and credible VA examination report is the most probative evidence to assess the level of disability. 

Based on this evidence, there is no showing of a prolapsed organ which would result in a compensable rating under DC 7261.  The Board thus considers the AOJ's use of that diagnostic code within the hyphenated rating for the uterine fibroid to be inappropriate, but any error caused by use of this diagnostic code is harmless as there is no adverse effect to the Veteran.  

A compensable rating does not result under the General Rating Formula, because the evidence shows that the Veteran's irregular menstrual cycles had resolved during service with medication, and that further treatment was not necessary.  Thus, ratings higher than the assigned 0 percent ratings under DCs 7613 and 7615 are not warranted because continuous treatment has not been required for either condition.

A compensable rating is not available under DC 7632 for female sexual arousal disorder.  However, the Board is mindful that the Veteran's special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) accounts for loss of use of a creative organ throughout the appeal period.

Accordingly, as most of the evidence weighs against the claims (that is to say, is neither in approximate balance nor nearly equal), the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable and the claims for increased ratings for ovarian cyst and uterine fibroid must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

REASONS FOR REMAND

9. Service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy

The Veteran seeks an increased disability rating for service-connected back disability.  The Board finds that the claim includes a claim for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, which has been shown in the record.  See, e.g., October 2023 JLV / MTF, pp. 21 (8/16/2023), 35 (3/8/2023) (describing sciatica pain for the past 3 months).  

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  To substantiate a claim of secondary service connection there must be evidence of (i) a current chronic disability for which service connection is sought; (ii) an already service-connected disability; and (iii) that the already service-connected disability (a) caused or (b) aggravated the disability for which service connection is sought.  See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

In the September 2022 VA examination of the Veteran's back, the examiner indicated there were no signs or symptoms of radiculopathy.  However, the examiner did not discuss the indications of such, which had been shown in STRs for several months leading up to the examination.  Thus, the VA examination was inadequate and constitutes a duty to assist error prior to the rating decision now on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  A new examination is required correct the error by addressing this medical evidence and to offer an etiological opinion as to whether such a condition is proximately caused or proximately aggravated by the service-connected back condition.

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of right lower extremity radiculopathy.  The examiner should indicate review of the complete record, and all indicated testing should be performed.  Thereafter, the examiner should address the following:

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced, if not higher) that the Veteran has a right lower extremity radiculopathy condition that is caused by her service-connected back disability?

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced, if not higher) that the Veteran has a right lower extremity radiculopathy condition that is made worse by (aggravated by) her service-connected back disability?

The examiner's discussion should directly address the indications in STRs that the Veteran had right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy from approximately January 2022 forward.

A comprehensive rationale for all opinions is to be provided.  All pertinent evidence, including both lay and medical, should be considered.  

Regarding secondary service connection questions, in answering the questions pertaining to worsening, please note that worsening includes the natural progression of a disability that can be attributed to a service-connected disability or the treatment prescribed for a service-connected disability. For example, an inability to undergo knee surgery due to low hematocrit caused by medication prescribed for service-connected leukemia can cause the natural progression of the knee disability.

If an opinion cannot be given without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
