ORDER

An initial compensable rating for service-connected right ear hearing loss is denied for the period from October 13, 2022, to August 2, 2023.

Service connection for left ear hearing loss is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. From October 13, 2022, to August 2, 2023, the Veteran's service-connected right ear hearing loss manifested with 29 average pure tone decibel hearing loss and 94 percent speech recognition.

2. The Veteran did not have a left ear hearing loss disability during the appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for service-connected right ear hearing loss were not met from October 13, 2022, to August 2, 2023. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.85, 4.86, 4.87a, Diagnostic Code ("DC") 6100.

2. The criteria to establish service connection for left ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from August 2009 to August 2010.

This matter is on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision by a VA Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182 or "NOD") and selected the direct review docket.

Under the direct review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 decision on appeal. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the RO issued the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If evidence was associated with the claim file during a period when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board did not consider it in its decision. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.   

INCREASED RATINGS

VA assigns disability ratings by applying criteria in its Schedule for Rating Disabilities ("the Rating Schedule"). Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question of which two evaluations should be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In disability rating cases, VA assesses the level of disability from the initial grant of service connection or a year prior to the date of application for an increased rating and determines whether the level of disability warrants the assignment of different disability ratings at different times over the course of the claim, a practice known as "staged ratings." See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999); see also Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007) (holding that staged ratings may be warranted in increased rating claims).

VA will assign a higher disability rating when the evidence supports the claim, or when the evidence for and against the claim is approximately balanced. When the evidence is approximately balanced, VA will resolve any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran. When the evidence is not approximately balanced, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve, and the claim will be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3rd 1391 (2021).

An initial compensable rating for service-connected right ear hearing loss is denied for the period from October 13, 2022, to August 2, 2023.

For purposes of evaluating the Veteran's service-connected right ear hearing loss, the rating period began October 13, 2022, the date VA received his claim for service connection. The rating period closed on August 2, 2023, the date the Veteran was notified of the decision on appeal.

The Rating Schedule provides rating tables for the evaluation of hearing impairment. Table VI assigns a Roman numeral designation (I through XI) for hearing impairment based on the pure tone threshold average and controlled speech discrimination (Maryland CNC) testing. Table VIa assigns a Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment based only on the pure tone threshold average and is used when speech discrimination testing is not appropriate or when indicated under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.86, which relate to exceptional patterns of hearing impairment. The "pure tone threshold average" is the sum of the pure tone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, divided by four. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85 (d).

Table VII is used to determine the rating assigned by combining the Roman numeral designations for hearing impairment of each ear. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85 (e).

Exceptional patterns of hearing impairment are provided for in 38 C.F.R. § 4.86. When the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever results in the higher numeral. Each ear is evaluated separately. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 (a).

Ratings for hearing impairment are derived by the mechanical application of the Rating Schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are rendered. Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992). In addition to providing objective test results, a VA audiological examination report must address the functional effects caused by a hearing disability because an extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321 (b) "does not rely exclusively on objective test results to determine whether a referral for an extraschedular rating is warranted." Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447, 455 (2007). VA's policy requiring VA audiologists to describe the effect of a hearing disability on occupational functioning and daily activities facilitates extraschedular determinations.

At a December 2022 VA audiological examination, the Veteran's pure tone thresholds were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	10	15	25	40	35

The average pure tone thresholds of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, rounded to the nearest whole number, were 29 for the right ear. Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 94 percent in the right ear using the Maryland CNC word list. The Veteran endorsed difficulty hearing conversational speech in-person and on the telephone and having to "read lips."

The December 2022 VA examination results yield a numerical designation of I for the right ear (between 0 and 41 average pure tone decibel hearing loss, with between 92 and 100 percent speech discrimination). See Table VI. The Veteran's nonservice-connected left ear hearing loss is assigned a numerical designation of I. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(f). Entering the category designations for both ears into Table VII results in a noncompensable rating.

The Veteran is competent to describe the effects of his hearing loss on his daily functioning. However, disability ratings are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule. See Lendenmann, above. The Veteran does not have the specialized training required to interpret audiometric test findings and give an opinion on the severity of his hearing loss based on the Rating Schedule. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (A layperson is generally not capable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge).

The Board must base its determination on the results of the audiological examination of record. As explained above, the pure tone thresholds and speech recognition scores from the December 2022 audiological examination results in a noncompensable evaluation.

There is no evidence or allegation that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss worsened since the December 2022 VA audiological examination.

The rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing. When a veteran's hearing loss results in an inability to hear or understand speech or to hear other sounds in various contexts, those effects are contemplated by the schedular rating criteria. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017). The Veteran's reduced hearing acuity and clarity is contemplated in the ratings assigned. See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).

For the reasons above, the evidence weighs heavily against assigning an initial compensable rating for right ear hearing loss from October 13, 2022, to August 2, 2023. There is no reasonable doubt to resolve. See Lynch, above.

SERVICE CONNECTION

VA grants service connection for disabilities resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). "Direct" service connection requires: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus (a causal link) between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). Disorders diagnosed after discharge may still be service connected if the evidence establishes that the disorder was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d); see Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Certain "chronic" diseases, including sensorineural hearing loss, may be service connected even if there is no evidence of the disease during service. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.309 (a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Where the evidence shows a "chronic disease" in service or "continuity of symptoms" after service, VA presumes the disease was incurred in service. This is referred to as "presumptive" service connection.

Additionally, where a veteran served ninety days or more of active service, and certain chronic diseases, such as sensorineural hearing loss, manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from service, the disease will be presumed to have been incurred in service, even if there is no evidence of the disease during service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309 (a). While the disease need not be diagnosed within one year of separation, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. Id.

When the Board evaluates a claim, it must decide if the evidence is competent. "Competent" evidence comes from a person who is qualified to make a statement or opinion because of their training, education, or experience. 

For example, medical professionals are generally competent through training and experience to diagnose medical conditions and express opinions about whether a disability was caused by service. Generally, the opinions of medical professionals such as doctors, psychiatrists, nurses, and others who work in the health care field may be competent because they apparently have specialized training, as shown in the detail of their reports and knowledge of the facts in individual cases. 

A person without medical training (i.e., a "layperson") is generally not competent to diagnose complex medical conditions or give an opinion on the cause of a disease or injury. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). For example, a layperson would not be competent to diagnose cancer or give an opinion that cancer was caused by an event during military service.

However, a layperson is competent to report symptoms that they observe firsthand through their senses. For example, a layperson does not need medical training to competently state that they have ringing in the ears, pain, a limp, a broken leg, difficulty breathing, or skin rashes. See Jandreau, Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). 

In deciding claims, the Board evaluates the entire record on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a). When the evidence fully supports the claim, it will be granted. When the evidence for and against the claim is approximately balanced, the Board resolves any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and grant the claim. When the evidence is not approximately balanced, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve, and the claim will be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch.

Service connection for left ear hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran has been diagnosed with left ear hearing loss and VA has recognized that the condition was caused by military noise. However, the claim will be denied because the Veteran's left ear hearing loss is not a disability under the law.

In addition to the general rules for establishing service connection above, other provisions apply to service connection for hearing loss. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Under this rule, impaired hearing is considered a disability only if at least one of the thresholds for the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; the thresholds for at least three of the frequencies are greater than 25 decibels; or speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385; Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993).

The Veteran's in-service audiological evaluations do not show hearing loss for VA purposes. His February 2008 enlistment report of medical examination showed a normal hearing evaluation and normal audiological test results in both ears.

At a June 2008 audiological examination prior to active service, a clinician opined that the Veteran's hearing was essentially within normal limits ("WNL"). The Veteran denied trauma to the ears, tinnitus, or exposure to noise from guns.

June 2008 and June 2009 audiological testing showed normal hearing for VA purposes.

In a June 2009 periodic health assessment, the Veteran denied difficulty hearing and was assigned a '1' rating assessing his hearing under the PULHES profile system, indicating a high level of fitness. See Odiorne v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 456, 457 (1992); ((observing that the "PULHES" profile reflects the overall physical and psychiatric condition of the veteran's capacity and stamina ("P"); upper extremities ("U"); lower extremities ("L"); hearing ("H "); eyes ("E") and psychiatric condition ("S"); assessed on a scale of 1 (high level of fitness) to 4 (a medical condition or physical defect which is below the level of medical fitness for retention in the military service)).

The service records, including service audiological examinations, are highly probative both as to the Veteran's subjective reports and their resulting objective findings. They were generated with a view towards ascertaining the Veteran's then-state of physical fitness and are akin to statements of diagnosis or treatment. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 73 (1997) (observing that although formal rules of evidence do not apply before the Board, recourse to the Federal Rules of Evidence may be appropriate if it assists in the articulation of the reasons for the Board's decision); see also LILLY'S: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE LAW OF EVIDENCE, 2nd Ed. (1987), pp. 245-46 (many state jurisdictions, including the federal judiciary and Federal Rule 803 (4), expand the hearsay exception for physical conditions to include statements of past physical condition on the rationale that statements made to physicians for purposes of diagnosis and treatment are exceptionally trustworthy since the declarant has a strong motive to tell the truth in order to receive proper care).

The Veteran's post-service VA medical records do not contain audiometric test results showing a hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

At a December 2022 VA audiological examination, the Veteran's pure tone thresholds were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	15	15	20	35	30

The average pure tone thresholds of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, rounded to the nearest whole number, were 25 for the left ear. Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 94 percent in the left ear using the Maryland CNC word list. The Veteran endorsed difficulty hearing conversational speech in-person and on the telephone and having to "read lips." A VA audiologist opined that the Veteran's "mild" left ear hearing loss was likely caused by military noise but was not severe enough to be considered a disability under VA' regulations. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, above.

There is no evidence or allegation that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss worsened since the December 2022 VA audiological examination.

The claim is denied because the Veteran does not have a left ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes. The "current disability" element of service connection has not been met. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); see also Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1995) (Congress specifically limited entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents had resulted in a disability).

The Veteran's hearing was normal during service and there is no competent evidence that his left hearing loss manifested to a compensable degree within one year of service separation (or any other time during the appeal). Presumptive service connection based on a chronic disease is not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.309.

The evidence weighs heavily against finding that the Veteran had a left ear hearing loss disability during the appeal and is not approximately balanced. There is no reasonable doubt to resolve. Lynch.
