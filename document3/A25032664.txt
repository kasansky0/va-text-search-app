REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 1969 to July 1971 and from October 1973 to October 1975.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from September 2023 and January 2024 AMA rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran filed a timely appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals (The Board) and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the appeal is now properly before the Board, and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 and January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's VA Form 10182, in addition to the issues addressed herein, includes an appeal of the claim of service connection for right testicular torsion. However, the Board notes that the Veteran had already submitted a separate VA Form 10182 for the testicular torsion issue on February 19, 2024 (about a week prior), and that it has been separately addressed. In this regard, the Board notes that a separate Board decision addressing this issue was issued in March 2025. As this matter is already addressed in a separate appeal track, the Board will only address the remaining issues on appeal as shown in the February 23, 2024 VA Form 10182.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for hypertension prior to April 26, 2023, and in excess of 10 percent thereafter

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a compensable rating for his hypertension prior to April 26, 2023, and in excess of 10 percent thereafter. 

The Veteran's service-connected hypertension is rated according to Diagnostic Code 7101.  Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

In rating hypertension under DC 7101, the Board may consider blood pressure readings taken while a veteran is using medication.  McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016).  

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a noncompensable evaluation for a diagnostic code, a noncompensable evaluation will be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Period Prior to April 26, 2023

An October 2022 VA treatment record shows that, at such time, the Veteran's blood pressure reading was 169/81. A repeat blood pressure check yielded a reading of 157/94. The Veteran was prescribed daily Lisinopril for control of his blood pressure, and the VA clinician further noted that the Veteran's BP is suboptimal. The Veteran's hypertension diagnosis was confirmed. Subsequently, in April 2023 VA treatment records, the Veteran's blood pressure was again noted to be suboptimal by the VA provider, and his blood pressure was measured at 172/86. A repeat blood pressure reading yielded a reading of 169/84. The target blood pressure goal both in October 2022 and April 2023 was noted as sub 135/80. 

The above-referenced blood pressure readings and medical records constitute the entirety of the relevant evidence of record addressing the Veteran's hypertension during the appeal period prior to April 26, 2023. 

The Board finds that while the evidence of record does not indicate a diastolic blood pressure of 100 or more, the Veteran's systolic blood pressure was predominantly 160 or more during this period. In this regard, blood pressure readings in October 2022 and April 2023, were reflective of systolic blood pressure measured as 169 and 172 and 169 respectively. While a repeat reading in October 2022 showed blood pressure at 157/94, this is the only reading of record (one of four) during the appeal period with systolic pressure slightly below 160. In addition, the evidence indicates that the Veteran was prescribed a regular medication regimen to control his blood pressure.  Thus, the Board finds that a 10 percent rating is warranted based on systolic blood pressure predominantly 160 or more. 

The Board notes that the Veteran does not contend, nor is there any evidence of record showing the Veteran' s diastolic pressure was recorded as 110 or more or showing systolic pressure recorded 200 or more during this period. 

Accordingly, a 10 percent evaluation, but no more, for the Veteran's hypertension is warranted for the period prior to April 26, 2023 and the claim is granted.

Period Beginning April 26, 2023

The Veteran was afforded a VA hypertension examination in September 2023. The Veteran's hypertension diagnosis was confirmed. The Veteran reported that his hypertension has worsened over time. In addition, the VA clinician noted that the Veteran's treatment plan includes taking continuous medication for hypertension, to include Lisinopril daily. The clinician noted that the Veteran does not have a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation of predominantly 100 or more. Current blood pressure readings were noted as 157/81, 159/87 and 131/82. The clinician noted that the Veteran has to follow up with his doctor three times per year.

Significantly, the clinician documented the Veteran's history of blood pressure readings pursuant to a review of his medical records. Pertinently for this period, the clinician noted a May 2023 home reading of 134/80 and a May 2023 admission reading of 134/72. 

Review of contemporaneous VA treatment records reflects that a separate May 2023 patient education note showed separate readings of 158/90, 144/76, 142/89 and 147/83, and in August 2023, the Veteran's blood pressure was recorded as 162/75. A June 2023 VA treatment note recorded 20 blood pressure readings the Veteran measured from home, all of which showed systolic pressure below 160 and diastolic pressure under 90. 

The Board notes that the Veteran does not contend, nor is there any evidence of record showing the Veteran' s diastolic pressure was recorded as 110 or more or showing systolic pressure recorded 200 or more during this period. 

In fact, the Veteran's representative concedes in the March 2024 appeal brief that he was unable to locate any readings showing diastolic blood pressure of 100 or more. While the representative indicated having counted 7 readings showing systolic pressure over 160, he did not indicate knowledge of any systolic readings of 200 or more. 

Given the above, the Board finds that while the Veteran has experienced elevated blood pressure, his blood pressure has not risen to a level where he reached or maintained diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  As such, the preponderance of the evidence is against the assignment of a rating greater than 10 percent for the entire appeal period.  Accordingly, an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for hypertension is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for hypertension

In the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for hypertension on a presumptive basis effective August 10, 2022, the effective date of the PACT Act. The PACT Act included a provision adding hypertension to the list of illnesses presumptively associated with toxic exposures in service, including Agent Orange. The Board further notes the Veteran was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal The AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) in service. 

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an earlier effective date than August 10, 2022 for the grant of entitlement to service connection for hypertension. He has not raised specific contentions.

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. When an award is based on a claim to reopen a previously denied claim, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the new (i.e., reopened) claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless new and material evidence was received within the relevant appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q).

The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ fully developed claim in December 2022. In the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for hypertension on a presumptive basis effective August 10, 2022, the effective date of the PACT Act, because the Veteran had filed his claim within one year of the PACT Act's effective date. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

Regarding earlier effective date claims for service connection for diseases presumptively associated with herbicide agents, VA has promulgated special rules to implement federal court orders in the class action of Nehmer v. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 284 F.3d 158, 1161 (9th Cir. 2002) (Nehmer III). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.816. In short, the Nehmer litigation has created an exception to the generally applicable effective date rules in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.114. A Nehmer class member is a Vietnam veteran who has a covered herbicide disease. However, the Secretary of VA issued an October 2022 Executive Decision Memorandum explaining that the Nehmer effective date rules in 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 do not apply to the presumptions created on or after August 10, 2022, to include those created by the PACT Act (such as hypertension).

In this case, August 10, 2022 - the effective date of the PACT Act (including the liberalizing provision adding hypertension to the list of diseases presumptively associated with exposure to herbicide agents) - was the earliest possible effective date for the grant of service connection for hypertension under applicable law. 

As explained above, the PACT Act eliminated the presumptive processes previously set forth at 38 U.S.C. § 1116(b) and created separate and distinct processes for all newly created presumptions, including those for toxic exposure.

Further, the Board points out that the current claim for entitlement to service connection was received on December 7, 2022 - well after the date of the current effective date of the grant of service connection. 

Therefore, because claims granted under the PACT Act are effective no earlier than August 10, 2022 (the date of enactment of the Act), and here the Veteran's entitlement for service connection was received in December 2022 and has only been granted pursuant to the PACT Act, and not on a direct basis, entitlement to an effective date prior to the date of the enactment of the PACT Act is denied.

Moreover, as discussed above, the Nehmer effective date rules do not apply here. In summary, the AOJ properly assigned an effective date of August 10, 2022 for the grant of entitlement to service connection for hypertension.

In conclusion, an earlier effective date than August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for hypertension is denied. As the evidence is not at least in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply.

SERVICE CONNECTION

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in, or aggravated by, active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131. Generally, the evidence must show (1) the existence of a present disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service (nexus). Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Additionally, a showing of continuity of symptoms from separation to the present is a factor to be considered in assessing service connection claims.

Entitlement to service connection for a neck disability

The Veteran seeks service connection for neck disability, which he contends arose during his active service while working inside boiler rooms and mud drums in the Navy. See December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. After review, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted, as a current neck disability is not currently shown.

As an initial matter, the Veteran's service treatment records were silent for complaints, treatment or diagnosis of any neck disability. In fact, the Veteran's separation examination of September 1975, including a physical clinical examination, showed a normal spine, head and neck. In the associated report of medical history, the Veteran denied having or ever having had any recurrent back pain or a head injury. In fact, the Veteran's representative acknowledges in a March 2024 Appellate Brief that service records are negative for a neck condition. 

Review of the Veteran's post-service medical records shows that the first report of any neck issue was in a January 2018 VA medical records, where the Veteran reported neck pain after rolling out of bed and hitting his head on a nightstand. He was diagnosed with a cervical strain of the trapezius muscle. Nonetheless, subsequent VA physical examinations, including in February 2018, August 2018, February 2019, July 2019, September 2019 and March 2020 reflect normal neck findings. 

The Board finds the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of any neck disability after 2018, and the condition has not been diagnosed during the appeal period. The Veteran had not been diagnosed with a cervical strain for nearly 4 years prior to the claim. Thus, there is no current disability. See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 219 (2007); Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1333 (1997) (holding that the existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation). In the absence of such a disability, there is no basis for service connection. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Board recognizes that service connection is still possible in the absence of a diagnosis when certain factors, such as pain, are shown that limit functional ability. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ("pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability"). However, the Board notes that the Veteran has not made any current statements as to the nature of his purported neck disability, nor of its purported impact. Thus, a level of severity that indicates functional impairment is not demonstrated.

The Veteran is competent to describe factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, and his assertions in that regard are entitled to some probative weight. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). However, he is not competent to establish the presence or etiology of a cervical spine disability. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Because this disability is not diagnosed by unique and readily identifiable features, it does not have a simple identification that a layperson is competent to make. Therefore, to the extent the Veteran states or believes he has a neck disability, he lacks competency.

In summation, service connection is not warranted for a neck disability because no current disability has been shown during the appeal period. The claim is denied. The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
