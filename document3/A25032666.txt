ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's bilateral pes planus is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis is denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's psychiatric disability, to include anxiety, depression, and insomnia is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's bilateral pes planus is related to an in service injury or event. 

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis is related to an in service injury or event. 

3. The Veteran's psychiatric disability is related to his active duty service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for the Veteran's bilateral pes planus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army National Guard from May 2017 to August 2017, May 2018 to July 2018, and from August 2018 to April 2019. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  To establish service connection for the claimed disorder, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry.  First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source.  Second, the Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007).  Third, the Board must weigh the probative value of the evidence in light of the entirety of the record.  A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

1. Bilateral Pes Planus and Bilateral Plantar Fasciitis

The favorable findings from the March 2024 AOJ rating decision documented that the Veteran has bilateral pes planus and plantar fascial fibromatosis.  However, the Veteran's service treatment records fail to document any in service treatment, complaints, or a diagnosis for these conditions.  Therefore, there is a lack of evidence to prove a nexus for the Veteran's current disabilities.  

The Veteran was not afforded a VA examination for his disabilities.  VA must provide a VA medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for VA to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 86 (2006).  

The Board finds that a VA examination was not warranted because of the lack of evidence of an in service occurrence.  As noted above, there is no evidence in the Veteran's service treatment records that he had bilateral pes planus or bilateral plantar fasciitis in service.  Additionally, he has not presented any lay evidence linking his disabilities to service.  The Board finds that there is no probative evidence in the record of an in service injury or event to link to the Veteran's current disabilities to necessitate a VA examination.  Consequently, as there is no probative evidence in the record to connect the Veteran's bilateral pes planus and bilateral plantar fasciitis to his active-duty service, service connection for these disabilities is denied.

1. Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia 

The Board has rephrased his claim of entitlement to service connection for anxiety, depression, and insomnia as a claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (stating that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).

In March 2024, the Veteran received a VA examination for his psychiatric disability.  A February 2024 VA treatment record documented the Veteran's complaints of depressive symptoms and "feel[ing] empty," since discharge from service.  The examiner also noted the Veteran's complaints of sleep issues after returning from deployment.  Additionally, while deployed his duties required him to work around the clock causing sleep issues.  The examiner noted that insomnia is prevalent in military personnel, especially veterans in support of combat efforts, like the Veteran.  Further, deployment-related stressors including, combat exposure, irregular sleep schedule, and the adjustment period when returning home, can contribute to insomnia.  Thus, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's insomnia was related to his active duty service.

The Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's psychiatric disability is warranted.  The positive March 2024 VA opinion provided credible, competent evidence for the Veteran's service connection claim.  Consequently, as there is no probative evidence against the Veteran's claim, service connection for his psychiatric disability is granted.
