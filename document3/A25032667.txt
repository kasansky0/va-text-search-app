FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent evidence of record shows the Veteran has not had a folliculitis diagnosis at any point during the appeal period.

2. The competent evidence of record shows the Veteran has not had an inguinal abscess diagnosis at any point during the appeal period. 

3. New and relevant evidence has not been received since the September 2023 denial of the claim for service connection for headaches.

4. New and relevant evidence has not been received since the September 2023 denial of the claim for service connection for a respiratory condition.

5. New and relevant evidence has not been received since the September 2023 denial of the claim for service connection for a right arm disability.

6. New and relevant evidence has not been received since the September 2023 denial of the claim for service connection for a right knee disability.

7. New and relevant evidence has not been received since the September 2023 denial of the claim for service connection for a cerebrovascular accident.

8. The VA examination used to justify the reduction from 30 percent to 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica was inadequate and the preponderance of the evidence does not show that acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica actually improved.

9. Service connection for the Veteran's acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica has been granted as secondary to diabetes mellitus whose service connection effective date is August 10, 2022.

10. Service connection for the Veteran's ED has been granted as secondary to diabetes mellitus whose service connection effective date is August 10, 2022.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1969 to December 1970.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) on appeal from rating decisions dated June 2023, July 2023 and February 2024 of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal for the issues of an earlier effective date for grant of service connection for diabetic neuropathy of the right and left upper and lower extremities; the July 2023 AOJ decision on appeal for the issue of an earlier effective date for grant of service connection for acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica; and the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal for the remaining issues on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for rash, tinea cruris and keloid scars, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that the Veteran included in the May 2024 VA Form 10182 the issue of an earlier effective date for diabetes mellitus, which was last adjudicated in the January 2023 AOJ decision that granted service connected for diabetes mellitus. The May 2024 VA Form 10182 was received over one year following the VA notice letter regarding the January 2023 rating decision. The Veteran has not provided any cause for why the one-year period to appeal this award should be extended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109 (b). The Board finds that this May 2024 VA Form 10182 is untimely as to this issue, and it therefore does not have jurisdiction over the attempted appeal.

1. Service connection for folliculitis

2. Service connection for inguinal abscess

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection requires evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

In the absence of a current diagnosed disability, service connection cannot be granted for such disability. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). The requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or at any time during the pendency of that claim. See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).

Where lay evidence is competent, the Board must weigh the competent lay evidence against the other evidence of record in determining credibility. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1334-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006). However, the absence of corroborating records is an insufficient basis on which to find lay statements not credible. Id. at 1337.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

In the February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the following findings: (1) the evidence shows service in Thailand; (2) the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability as VA medical treatment records show a complaint, diagnosis and/or treatment for folliculitis - resolved and inguinal abscess - resolved; and (3) exposure to herbicides during military service. Under the Appeals Modernization Act, the Board is bound by the favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. The Board finds no clear and unmistakable error in this instance.

Regarding whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a disability of folliculitis and inguinal abscess, the Board notes that the favorable findings notes that the Veteran was diagnosed as having folliculitis and inguinal abscess, both resolved. As such, this is not a finding of a current disability as both conditions were reported as resolved. Although service treatment records (STRs) note that the Veteran had folliculitis or inguinal abscess during service, see STRs dated March 1970 and April 1970, a careful review of the record, including VA and private treatment records and VA examinations, finds no current diagnosis of folliculitis or inguinal abscess. In fact, the November 2023 VA examination report specifically states that these two conditions were completely resolved and noted no residuals associated with the same.  Significantly, when noting current skin conditions neither folliculitis nor inguinal abcess were noted.  Instead, they were noted in the medical history section, and as noted above, were noted to be completely resolved.  Additional VA skin examinations dated February 2023 and July 2023 also do not contain any evidence of folliculitis or an inguinal abscess or any residuals therefore.  

After a thorough consideration of the evidence of the record, the Board finds that there is no current disability pertaining to the claimed folliculitis or inguinal abscess. Service connection requires a showing of a current disability. In the absence of proof of a present disability (and, if so, of a nexus between that disability and service), there can be no valid claim for service connection. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Therefore, in accordance with the laws and regulations, entitlement to service connection for folliculitis or inguinal abscess must be denied.

3. Whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted, sufficient to readjudicate the claim for headaches

4. Whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted, sufficient to readjudicate the claim for a respiratory condition

5. Whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted, sufficient to readjudicate the claim for a right arm disability

6. Whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted, sufficient to readjudicate the claim for a right knee disability

7. Whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted, sufficient to readjudicate the claim for a cerebrovascular accident

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for headaches, a respiratory condition, a right arm disability, a right knee disability and a cerebrovascular accident most recently addressed in a September 2023 rating decision. In February 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received. Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

The Board concludes that new and relevant evidence sufficient to readjudicate the claim has not been submitted.

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156 (d), 3.2501(a)(1). New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1). "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue. Id. 

The Veteran's initial claim for service connection for headaches, a respiratory condition, a right arm disability, a right knee disability and a cerebrovascular accident was denied in a September 2023 rating decision. Evidence added to the record since the September 2023 denial includes new VA treatment records that are not relevant as they do not contain treatment for headaches, a respiratory condition, a right arm disability, a right knee disability or a cerebrovascular accident. The evidence added since the September 2023 denial also includes duplicative copies of VA treatment records previously of record at the time of the September 2023 decision. There has been no new evidence regarding the Veteran's claimed headaches, a respiratory condition, a right arm disability, a right knee disability and a cerebrovascular accident added to the record since September 2023. Accordingly, readjudication is not warranted.

8. The appeal for restoration of a 30 percent rating for acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica

When the propriety of a rating reduction is at issue, the focus is on the actions of the RO in effectuating the reduction, both in terms of compliance with due process considerations, and whether the evidence at the time of the decision reducing the evaluation supported the reduction. In most cases, violations of the set of due process considerations applicable to rating reductions, or failure of the evidence to meet the standards for reducing an evaluation, render the underlying reduction void ab initio, rather than merely voidable. The burden is on VA to justify a reduction in a rating. See Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993) (finding that VA is required to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence and in compliance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.344, that a rating reduction is warranted).

The criteria governing certain rating reductions for certain service-connected disabilities are found under 38 C.F.R. § 3.344. For ratings in effect for less than five years, adequate reexamination that discloses improvement in the disability warrants reduction in rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c). The duration of the disability rating at issue is measured by the effective date assigned for that rating until the effective date of the actual reduction. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 418 (1993). 

Nevertheless, in any rating-reduction case, regardless of whether the evaluation has been in effect for five years or more, certain general regulations need to be considered. Specifically, it is necessary to ascertain, based upon a review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in disability and whether examination reports reflecting change are based upon thorough examinations. In addition, it must be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred and that such improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10, 4.13; 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c) (authorizing reduction of a rating in effect for less than five years on the basis of examination disclosing improvement).

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran's rating was not in place for more than five years at the time of the reduction and all procedural due process requirements were met. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105 (e), 3.344.

After review of the record, the Board finds that restoration of the Veteran's 30 percent rating is warranted. Specifically, the AOJ made no findings in the February 2024 decision as to whether there was material improvement in the Veteran's acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica or whether the Veteran attained improvement under the ordinary conditions of life. The AOJ merely stated that the November 2023 VA examination shows that a 10 percent evaluation is warranted. Additionally, the RO did not compare the medical findings in the November 2023 VA examination to the previous medical findings contained in the February 2023 VA examination. Significantly, the November 2023 VA examination did not provide the combined percentage affecting the total body regarding the Veteran's multiple service-connected skin conditions as was given in the February 2023 VA examination, which is necessary since there are three diagnosed service-connected skin disabilities that affect the body and were assigned varying percentages of body area affected. Therefore, it was not possible to adequately rate the Veteran's service-connected disability based on the VA examination. Further, the November 2023 VA examination did not demonstrate an actual change or improvement of the disability as the symptoms were similar in comparison to the previous VA examination. 

In light of the inadequacy of the November 2023 VA examination report, the Board may not conclude that the evidence was adequate to support the rating reduction at issue. Further, the preponderance of the evidence does not show that the Veteran's service-connected acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica actually improved, including in terms of his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Thus, the reduction was improper and is void ab initio, and the appeal is granted.

9. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica

10. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction

11. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity diabetic neuropathy of the sciatic nerve

12. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity diabetic neuropathy of the sciatic nerve

13. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for left upper extremity diabetic neuropathy of the radial nerve

14. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for right upper extremity diabetic neuropathy of the radial nerve

The Veteran asserts that the effective date for the award of service connection for "all disabilities" should be March 2012. See May 2024 VA Form 21-4138, May 2024 VA Form 10182. Review of the record shows that in March 2012, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) claiming service connection for Agent Orange, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, keloids of face and chest, and neuropathy of the upper and lower extremities. 

In general, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation, is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

The Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) in a January 2023 rating decision. As relevant here, the PACT Act, was enacted on August 10, 2022. Therefore, the January 2023 rating decision assigned August 10, 2022, as the effective date for the award of service connection for diabetes mellitus.

Subsequently, a June 2023 rating decision awarded entitlement to service connection for ED as secondary to diabetes mellitus and diabetic neuropathy of the right and left upper and lower extremities as secondary to diabetes mellitus, and assigned effective dates of August 10, 2022 for each of these disabilities. In a July 2023 rating decision awarded entitlement to service connection for acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica as secondary to diabetes mellitus and assigned an effective date of August 10, 2022. The assigned effective dates of August 10, 2022 correspond with the effective date assigned for the primary disability of diabetes mellitus under the PACT Act.

The Court held in Frost v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 131 (2017) that for a Veteran to receive secondary service connection on a causation basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a), the primary disability need not be service connected, or even diagnosed, at the time the secondary condition is incurred. However, while a secondary condition may have an onset before the effective date of the award for service connection for, or diagnosis of, the primary condition, the effective date of a secondarily service-connected disability is precluded from being before the effective date of the primary service-connected disability. See Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting that effective dates for primary and secondary conditions are afforded the same treatment under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 and that secondary conditions arise at the same time or after primary conditions). This is such, because to establish secondary service connection, it must be secondary to a disability that is already service connected.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that no earlier effective date is warranted for the award of entitlement to service connection for ED; diabetic neuropathy of the right and left upper and lower extremities; and acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica as service connection was granted as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected diabetes mellitus, and the effective date of entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus is August 10, 2022, as set forth by the PACT Act. The effective date for the secondary disabilities claimed cannot be earlier than the effective date of the primary diabetes mellitus disability.

For all the above reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of entitlement to service connection for ED; diabetic neuropathy of the right and left upper and lower extremities; and acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence is not in approximate balance and weighs against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

After a thorough consideration of the evidence considered at the time of the February 2024 rating decision, the Board finds a remand is necessary in order to cure a pre-decisional duty to assist errors.

1. Service connection for rash is remanded.

2. Service connection for tinea cruris is remanded.

3. Service connection for keloid scars of the right side of the face and chest is remanded.

Service treatment records show that the Veteran was treated for tinea cruris during service. See March 1970, July 1970 STRs. Following service, an August 2013 VA treatment record shows that the Veteran was instructed to apply topical ointment to the penis area. No VA examination has been afforded to the Veteran regarding whether the currently treated skin condition in the groin area relates to the tinea cruris treated during service.  

Additionally, post-service treatment records show that the Veteran has been treated for atopic dermatitis, cellulitis and xerosis. See October 2011, November 2011, April 2019, October 2020, November 2020, October 2021, April 2023, October 2023 VA Treatment Records. Treatment for cellulitis note that the Veteran has a diagnosis of diabetes and states altered healing due to diabetes. See October 2011 VA Treatment Records. No VA examination has been afforded to the Veteran regarding whether the post-service atopic dermatitis, cellulitis and xerosis are related to his service-connected diabetes. 

The Veteran also contends that his keloid scars are related to problems he was treated for during service, including folliculitis, inguinal abscess, rash, and tinea cruris, as well as his service-connected acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica. See December 2023 VA Form 21-4138. Although the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his keloid scars, an opinion regarding whether his keloid scars are related to his inservice folliculitis, inguinal abscess, rash, and tinea cruris or secondary to his service-connected acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica have not been provided. See February 2023, July 2023 and November 2023 VA Examinations and Opinions. 

In order to properly adjudicate this appeal, a fully articulated and soundly reasoned medical opinion that accounts for the Veteran's competent lay testimony is needed.  As such, another VA examination must be afforded to the Veteran. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 125 (2007).

Finally, the Veteran is presumed exposed to herbicides during service and the Veteran contends that his skin conditions are related to that exposure. As the PACT Act requires that, when a veteran whose active service subjected the veteran to participation in a TERA files a claim to service connect a disability and there is evidence of such disability, as is the case in this matter, VA must provide the Veteran with a VA examination and obtain a medical opinion addressing the possibility of a nexus between the claimed disability and the TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a)(1).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ should arrange for a VA examination of the Veteran to determine the nature and likely cause of any rash (other than acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica), tinea cruris, and keloid scars of the right side of the face and chest. The examiner should review the claim file (including this remand) and note such review was conducted. Based on review of the record and examination of the Veteran with all necessary diagnostic testing, the examiner should provide an opinion with detailed rationale that responds to the following:

(a.) Please identify, by diagnosis, all skin disabilities, including any rash (other than acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica), tinea cruris, and keloid scars of the right side of the face and chest during the appeal period (from October 2023). The examiner must specifically address post-service treatment of atopic dermatitis, cellulitis and xerosis.

(b.) For each skin disability diagnosed, including any rash (other than acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica), tinea cruris, and keloid scars of the right side of the face and chest, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such disability was either incurred in or otherwise related to the Veteran's military service, to include as due to his in-service exposure to herbicides? Please explain why. In doing so, the examiner must consider the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

(c.) For each skin disability, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) proximately due to the service-connected diabetes or acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica?

(d.) For each skin disability, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) aggravated, i.e., worsened beyond its natural progression, by the service-connected diabetes or acanthosis nigricans, diabetic dermopathy, and necrobiosis lipoidica?

The examiner must specifically consider the Veteran's description of his in-service and post-service symptoms, including post-service treatment for atopic dermatitis, cellulitis and xerosis, and the documented in-service treatment for folliculitis, inguinal abscess, rash, and tinea cruris. 

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions expressed. When providing the requested opinions, the examiner is asked to state whether the evidence is in approximate balance or nearly equal in the Veteran's favor. If the examiner cannot provide a requested opinion without resorting to speculation, it must be so stated, and the examiner must provide the reasons why that opinion would require speculation. The examiner must indicate whether there was any further need for information or testing necessary to make a determination. Additionally, the examiner must indicate whether any opinion could not be rendered due to limitations of knowledge in the medical community at large and not those of the particular examiner.
