ORDER

Eligibility to the direct payment of fees for the past-due benefits resulting from the November 7, 2023, rating decision is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In March 2023, the Board granted compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for pancreatitis.  

2. A March 2023 rating decision implemented the grant and assigns a 30 percent evaluation, effective May 17, 2016.  

3. In May 2023, the Veteran submitted the VA Form 21-8940, which seeks an increased in the initial rating assigned by VA.  The Veteran continuously pursued the initial claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of fees for the past-due benefits resulting from the November 7, 2023, rating decision have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1978 to August 1978. The appellant, R.D., was the Veteran's attorney during periods pertinent to this appeal.

The fee decision on appeal (Summary of the Case) was issued in November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Because this is a contested claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 decision on appeal and a brief or argument filed by the party who did not file the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) if received within 30 days of the February 1, 2024, notice of the content of the NOD. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400 20.405.

This case involves a simultaneously contested claim; therefore, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 7105A are applicable. Cases involving simultaneously contested claims are also subject to special procedural regulations. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400, 20.401, 20.402, 20.403, 20.404, 20.405, 20.406, 20.407. Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 20.400 provides that, in a simultaneously contested claim, all interested parties are to be notified of the action taken by the AOJ and of the right and time limit for initiating an appeal, as well as notification of the right to a hearing and representation. Upon the filing of a notice of disagreement, all interested parties will be furnished a copy of the substance of the notice of disagreement, including what type of review was selected and whether a hearing was requested. 38 C.F.R. § 20.403.

VA complied with these procedures through letters to each party dated in November 2023, February 2024, and March 2024.

Eligibility to the direct payment of fees for the past-due benefits resulting from the November 7, 2023, rating decision.

The appellant, who was the Veteran's attorney for compensation claims, asserts that she is entitled to fees from the past-due benefits resulting from the award of a 100 percent rating in the November 7, 2023, rating decision.  In an argument accompanying her notice of disagreement, she set forth a timeline of the relevant actions in the case.  In particular, the appellant argues that VA incorrectly treatment a May 2023 VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, as a stand-alone new claim, unrelated to the pending and continuously pursued claim of chronic pancreatitis, which the Board had rated previously.

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904.

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA. The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (a). A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time. Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney. To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. A direct-pay fee agreement is a fee agreement between the claimant or appellant and an agent or attorney providing for payment of fees out of past-due benefits awarded directly to an agent or attorney. A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to pay the agent or attorney out of past-due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA. A copy of a direct pay fee agreement must be filed with the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case. This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1).

A supplemental claim filed more than a year after the initial rating decision is part of the original case, and an attorney may charge fees for representation provided in filing that supplemental claim. See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4 th 1110, 1138-41 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Fees are not payable for an award resulting from the initial decision in an increased rating claim. See Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024).

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636 (h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).

Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be reasonable if the agent or attorney provided representation that continued through the date of the decision awarding benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (f)(1).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded based on a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3). The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran. See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Jackson v. McDonald, 635 Fed. Appx. 858 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3)(i).

Recently, in Chisholm v. Collins, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that a VA Form 8940 was a supplemental claim making it eligible for fees when VA had previously denied a request for higher compensation. 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (Vet. App., March 13, 2025).  The Court, citing Jackson (Alexandra) v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277, 286 (2024), explained that supplemental claims can either "reengage VA to address a benefit once denied, [or] . . . continuously pursue an initial claim." Chisholm at *11.  But "[i]n either scenario, the claimant filing the supplemental claim must have 'previously filed a claim for the same or similar benefits on the same or similar basis.'" Id. (quoting 38 U.S.C. § 101(36)). 

In this case, the attorney has complied with regulatory POA and fee agreement requirements. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904.  Specifically, the Veteran and the appellant executed a January 2022 VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative." At that same time, the parties executed a direct pay fee agreement which provided that the appellant was entitled to fees in the amount of 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran, and that the fee was to be paid directly by VA to the appellant. The Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his representative and the associated fee agreement are valid.

The Board now turns to whether the appellant is otherwise eligible to charge fees.  The issue in the case is whether the November 2023 rating decision is the initial decision with respect to the case.

The November 2023 rating decision increased the Veteran's rating for pancreatitis from 30 percent to 100 percent effective May 24, 2023.  The rating decision stated that the Veteran filed a new claim for benefits that was received on May 24, 2023.  The Board must review the procedural history.

In March 2023, the Board granted compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for pancreatitis.  A March 2023 rating decision implemented the grant and assigned a 30 percent evaluation, effective May 17, 2016.  The appellant was awarded fees for the past-due benefits arising from this grant of compensation to the Veteran.

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted the VA Form 21-8940 that led to the award of an increased rating.

The Chisholm decision paves the way for a VA Form 21-8940 to be treated as a supplemental claim, although there was some caution from the concurring opinion, and the fact pattern does not quite fit the case here.  In Chisholm, the Veteran had had claims for increased ratings previously denied by VA.  Here, there was no increased rating claim denied.  Instead, this was an initial rating, following which the VA Form 21-8940 was filed.

Nonetheless, regulation 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3)(i) provides that, if an increased evaluation is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability evaluation initially assigned by the agency of original jurisdiction, then payment may be made.  Jackson holds that a supplemental claim can continuously pursue an initial claim.  37 Vet. App. at 286.  That is what the Board has before it.

Here, VA awarded the Veteran compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 at the 30 percent disability rate for a pancreatitis disability.  This was the initial claim and initial disability evaluation.  The Veteran continuously pursued the claim by filing the VA Form 21-8940.  The 21-8940 is, in essence, a claim for an increased rating.  Because the 21-8940 was filed within a year following the assignment of the initial rating, the Board deems it a supplemental claim an continuous pursuit of the initial claim for compensation.  Accordingly, fees are warranted.
