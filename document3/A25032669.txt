REMANDED

Entitlement to special durable medical equipment, a stair lift, including under the Home Improvement and Structural Alterations (HISA) program, is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active military service from April 1968 to April 1971.

In the March 2, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) award on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to special durable medical equipment, a stair lift, including under the HISA program, is remanded. 

The Veteran seeks a stair lift and/or stair glide to have access to the second level of his home due to his service-connected neuropathy symptoms.

The HISA program provides eligible beneficiaries monetary benefits for improvements and structural alterations to their homes when such improvements and structural alterations: (1) Are necessary for the continuation of the provision of home health treatment of the beneficiary's disability; or (2) Provide the beneficiary with access to the home or to essential lavatory and sanitary facilities. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1717(a), 1710(a); 38 C.F.R. § 17.3000. Eligible Veterans include those requesting HISA benefits to address any disability if the Veteran has a service-connected disability rating of 50 percent or greater. 38 U.S.C. § 1710(a); 38 C.F.R. § 17.3102.

For purposes of the regulations governing HISA benefits, "HISA benefits" means a monetary payment by VA to be used for improvements and structural alterations to the home of a beneficiary in accordance with §§ 17.3100 through 17.3130. "Home" means the primary place where the beneficiary resides or, in the case of a servicemember, where the beneficiary intends to reside after discharge from service. "Improvement or structural alteration" means a modification to a home or to an existing feature or fixture of a home, including repairs to or replacement of previously improved or altered features or fixtures. "Access to essential lavatory and sanitary facilities" means having normal use of the standard structural components of those facilities. "Access to the home" means the ability of the beneficiary to enter and exit the home and to maneuver within the home to at least one bedroom and essential lavatory and sanitary facilities. 38 C.F.R. § 17.3101.

In the instant matter, the file for the claim of entitlement to benefits under the HISA program, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1717, cannot be located, and documentation pertinent to the appeal is not in the electronic record. Therefore, it must be remanded in order for the AOJ to reconstruct the record and upload all documentation related to the appeal to the electronic claims file. If such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability.

Due process requires that the AOJ ensure that a copy of the record before it is made available for the Board's review in connection with the appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103 (requiring notice to claimants of required information and evidence), 5104 (requiring specific information in the notice of a decision), 5107 (requiring the Secretary to consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case). The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Accordingly, on remand, the records relating to the Veteran's stair lift claim should be obtained and associated with the claims file.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Reconstruct the record and upload all documentation related to the claim for entitlement to benefits under the HISA program, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1717, to the electronic claims file.

2. If such records are unable to be associated with the record, make a formal finding of unavailability.
