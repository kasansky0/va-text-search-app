CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to attorney fees, based on past-due benefits from the October 17, 2023, rating decision have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1968 to July 1971, during the Vietnam Era.

The appellant is the Veteran's attorney representative.

This matter is on appeal from a November 2, 2023, fee decision.

On November 20, 2023, the appellant timely filed VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement (NOD) to the November 2, 2023, fee decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

As an initial matter, a Board docketing letter was provided to both parties on November 27, 2023.  The Veteran was provided a redacted copy of the appellant's VA Form 10182 pursuant to contested claims procedures. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403-4. This is reflected in a January 13, 2024, AMA notification letter stating that a redacted copy of the appellant's Board Appeal Request (VA Form 10182) was provided. AMA notification letters were sent to both parties on January 13, 2024, and March 2, 2024. As the Veteran has not filed a response, the claim remains on the Direct Review docket, and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the fee decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405. 

Eligibility to attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in an October 17, 2023, decision, is granted.

The appellant contends that he is entitled to eligibility to attorney fees based on past due benefits awarded in an October 17, 2023, RO decision. Specifically, he asserts that that the RO granted benefits for the Veteran's persistent depressive disorder related to TBI, which stemmed from the February 17, 2023, supplemental claim. He further asserts that the February 17, 2023, supplemental claim cited the previous rating decision which granted service connection for TBI but assigned a 0 percent rating. The appellant argues that the grant of a 30 percent increased rating for persistent depressive disorder with TBI was the result of his supplemental claim requesting an increased rating for the Veteran's TBI. Further, in accordance with Military -Veteran's Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed.Cir. 2021), his supplemental claim qualified as continuous pursuit even though it was filed after one year from the date of the initial decision and was therefore a qualifying request for review of the initial November 2018 RO decision.

As will be explained in the discussion that follows, the Board finds that the Veteran's TBI and persistent depressive disorder were inextricably intertwined. Further, the November 2018 RO decision was an initial decision which was continuously pursued by the appellant's supplemental claim, resulting in an increased 30 percent rating for service-connected TBI (which was inextricably intertwined with peristent depressive disorder). Therefore, the criteria for eligibility to attorney fees has therefore been met, and the appeal is granted. 

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904.

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA. The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (a). A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time. Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney. To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g).

Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (f). When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636 (h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3). The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran. See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3)(i).

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28 (2023); Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024).

On December 30, 2022, the appellant and the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-22a, appointing the appellant as the Veteran's attorney representative, and a Fee Agreement. The Fee agreement provided that the appellant was entitled to 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran. As such, the Board finds that the appellant filed a validly executed fee agreement in accordance with the regulations.

Historically, on November 5, 2018, the RO issued a decision denying service connection for TBI. On December 29, 2022, the appellant and the Veteran signed a VA Form 21-22a, appointing the appellant as the Veteran's attorney representative, and a Fee Agreement. Both documents were filed on December 30, 2022. Also on December 30, 2022, the appellant submitted an intent to file. On February 17, 2023, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, the appellant listed the issues of service connection for TBI, migraines, diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea. 

On August 10, 2023, the RO granted, in relevant part, service connection for TBI, effective August 10, 2022, and assigned a 0 percent rating. On August 24, 2023, the Veteran was provided with a VA Initial Post-Traumatic Disorder (PTSD) examination. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's service-connected diagnosis of TBI and stated that the Veteran's symptoms of TBI and peristent depressive disorder overlapped and could not be differentiated. The VA examiner also found that the Veteran's social and occupational impairment was mild and transient.

On October 17, 2023, the RO issued a rating decision granting an increased evaluation for persistent depressive disorder with TBI, increased from 0 percent to 30 percent, effective December 30, 2022. The Board notes that the Veteran's persistent depressive disorder had not previously been service connected. The RO explained in its decision that because symptoms associated with TBI frequently overlap with symptoms of mental disorders a VA examination was provided to obtain a medical opinion. As the VA examiner could not differentiate the symptoms of one from the other, the higher of the possible evaluations was assigned. 

On November 2, 2023, the RO issued a Fee Decision denying the appellant eligibility to attorney fees stating that VA never received a qualifying request for review. However, the Board disagrees.

As set forth above, fees may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28 (2023); Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024). In other words, there must be an initial decision. In Perciavalle v. McDonough, 101 F.4 th 829, 839 (Fed. Cir. 2024), the Court clarified that the trigger for attorney fees is a prior "initial decision". 

The second part of the analysis is then whether there was continuous pursuit of the initial decision; the continuous pursuit of the initial decision would constitute qualifying request for review. Pertinent to the case at hand, in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4 th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021), the Federal Circuit found invalid 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (c)(1)(i)'s limitation of attorney fees in supplemental claims to only situations where the supplemental claim had been filed within one year of the prior rating decision. The Federal Circuit made clear that a supplemental claim is part of the same case as the initial rating decision, regardless of when the supplemental claim is filed. The Federal Circuit stated, "Just as a CUE claim belongs to the same 'case' as a veteran's original claim for benefits, thereby permitting paid representation for work performed after an AOJ's initial decision, so too does a... supplemental claim seeking the 'same or similar benefits on the same or similar basis as the original claim." Id. at 1141. The Federal Circuit held that agents and attorneys are eligible to receive fees pursuant to supplemental claims filed more than one year after a decision.

In the matter at hand, the claim for entitlement to service connection before the RO at the time of the November 5, 2018, RO decision was part of the same case as the Veteran's February 17, 2023, supplemental claim which sought service connection for TBI. Here, the caselaw supports that the November 5, 2018, RO decision was the initial decision and that the February 2023 supplemental claim being part of the same case as the November 5, 2018, initial decision kept the claim in continuous pursuit. See, Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4 th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021), holding that agents and attorneys are eligible to receive fees pursuant to supplemental claims filed more than one year after a decision. Also, the initial rating assigned is part of the claim for service connection and, therefore, part of the service connection case for fees purposes. See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484 (2006).

Next, the RO granted service connection for TBI on August 10, 2023, and assigned a 0 percent rating. Meanwhile, there was a pending intent to file a claim from December 30, 2022, presumably for service connection for a psychiatric disability. VA medical evidence was submitted August 24, 2023, showing that the Veteran had a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder which was inextricably intertwined with his TBI. As a result, the RO specifically granted an increased evaluation for persistent depressive disorder with TBI of 30 percent, in the October 17, 2023, rating decision. The RO's grant was based on receiving VA medical evidence indicating a higher rating was for application as the symptoms of TBI could not be differentiated from symptoms of persistent depressive disorder. The Veteran's service connected TBI was inextricably intertwined with persistent depressive disorder. Moreover, because the two disabilities were inextricably intertwined, the Board finds that the RO's grant of an increased 30 percent rating for persistent depressive disorder with TBI stemmed from the appellant's supplemental claim. In other words, but for the February 17, 2023, supplemental claim that resulted in a grant of service connection for TBI, there could not have been a grant of an increased rating for persistent depressive disorder with TBI. 

In sum, the triggering event for eligibility to attorney fees was the initial November 5, 2018, RO decision which denied service connection for TBI. Although more than one year passed before the Veteran's supplemental claim was received, under the caselaw, the supplemental claim for service connection was part of the same case as the November 5, 2018, denial of service connection, and constitutes continuous pursuit. See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4 th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Further, the initial rating assigned is part of the claim for service connection and, therefore, part of the service connection case for fees purposes. See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484 (2006). Therefore, the grant of the increased 30 percent rating for persistent depressive disorder with TBI, because the symptoms of the two disabilities are inextricably intertwined, is also part of the same service connection case. Accordingly, the criteria for eligibility to attorney fees, an initial decision and continuous pursuit through the appellant's supplemental claim, have been met and the appeal is granted.
