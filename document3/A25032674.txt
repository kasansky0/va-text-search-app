DOCKET NO. 240613-447214
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

An effective date earlier than August 18, 2022 for an increased evaluation from 30 percent to 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

A reduction in evaluation of right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome based on limitation of flexion from 10 percent to 0 percent was proper, and restoration of a 10 percent rating is denied.

Service connection for a left knee disability is denied.

A total disability rating based on individual unemployability as a result of service-connected disabilities (TDIU), to include referral for extraschedular consideration, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran's August 18, 2022 supplemental claim for an increased rating was received more than one year after the issue was last adjudicated in an August 2019 rating decision, and the evidence does not establish that any worsening occurred within one year prior to the claim.

2.  The Veteran's change in knee diagnostic code is not a reduction governed by 38 C.F.R. § 3.344, and his new code contemplates the painful motion compensated by the prior code.

3.  The Veteran's claimed left knee disability is not related to service, is not related to a service-connected disability, and did not manifest within one year of separation from service.

4.  The Veteran's service-connected disabilities have not rendered him unemployable or unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, and the evidence does not substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was rendered unemployable by his service-connected disabilities prior to August 18, 2022.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for an effective date earlier than August 18, 2022 for an increased evaluation from 30 percent to 70 percent for PTSD are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500 (2024).

2.  The reduction in evaluation of right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome based on limitation of flexion from 10 percent to 0 percent was proper.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.344, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5260, 5261 (2024).

3.  The criteria for service connection for a left knee disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310 (2024).

4.  The criteria for a TDIU, to include referral for extraschedular consideration, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2007 to August 2011, including service in Afghanistan, and served in the Reserve as well.

This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from July 2023, September 2023, and November 2023 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In his June 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of each agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the relevant AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 18, 2022 for an increased evaluation from 30 percent to 70 percent for PTSD

The Veteran claims an earlier effective date for his increased rating for PTSD.

Generally, the effective date of an award of an increased rating is the date of receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If the earliest date that the claimed increase in disability had occurred was factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record within one year prior to the receipt of claim, the effective date is the date such increase occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

A claim date may be maintained by?continuously pursuing?a claim or issue via supplemental claim, request for HLR, appeal to the Board, or appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC), provided such options are timely exercised within one year of the issuance of the decision.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  For supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.? 38 C.F.R. §?3.2500(h)(2). 

A June 2016 legacy rating decision reduced the Veteran's PTSD rating from 50 percent to 30 percent effective September 1, 2016.  He filed a timely legacy notice of disagreement in January 2017, and a statement of the case was issued in July 2018.  He perfected the appeal via an August 2018 VA Form 9.  In February 2019, the Veteran opted into the modernized review system by submitting a Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) election form and selecting the supplemental claim lane.  

In March 2019, the AOJ certified the Veteran's legacy appeal to the Board and sent the Veteran and his representative notice of such.  The Board did not send any docketing notification.  Approximately two weeks later, the Veteran and his representative were notified via a March 2019 letter that his RAMP election was accepted and that his legacy appeal had been withdrawn.  The AOJ issued a RAMP supplemental claim decision in August 2019, which continued his 30 percent rating.

In September 2020, the Veteran's representative inquired as to the status of his legacy appeal and was again informed that it had been withdrawn as part of the RAMP process.

VA treatment records reflect that in November 2021, the Veteran reported that he was still working nights and it was affecting his daytime sleep.  He reported that he still had some nightmares but did not always remember them.  He reported that he still was annoyed by people and irritable.  He stated that his mood was stable otherwise.  He was diagnosed with depression and a history of PTSD.

In a December 2021 submission, the Veteran's representative argued that the March 2019 certification of the Veteran's legacy appeal to the Board removed the AOJ's jurisdiction to effectuate the withdrawal.  The representative argued that the legacy appeal should be reinstated before the Board.

VA treatment records reflect that in January 2022 the Veteran reported that his mood had been a bit more down.  He otherwise reported the same symptoms noted in November 2021.  In February 2022 he reported that his mood was fair; otherwise, his description of his symptoms was unchanged.  He made similar reports in March 2022.  In July 2022 he reported that he changed jobs and now worked daytime hours.  His symptoms were otherwise unchanged.

On August 18, 2022, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim for an increased rating for PTSD.  He underwent a March 2023 VA examination.  A March 2023 rating decision increased his evaluation from 30 percent to 70 percent effective August 18, 2022.  In April 2023 he submitted a request for HLR of his effective date.  The July 2023 HLR decision on appeal denied an earlier effective date, considering the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2023 rating decision.  Therefore, for this issue, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  

In a June 2024 brief, the Veteran's representative argued that his increased rating should be effective August 15, 2011.  This argument was based on an extensive factual discussion to establish that entitlement to a 70 percent rating arose on that date.  None of the evidence or treatment records cited by the representative were from the year preceding the August 2022 supplemental claim.  The representative argued that the June 2016 reduction was improper and unlawful and took issue that the prior appeal of the reduction was addressed as an appeal for an increased rating.  Finally, the representative argued that the prior appeal was not eligible for RAMP because it had been certified to the Board prior to acknowledgement of the Veteran's RAMP election.

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Veteran's withdrawal of his legacy appeal in the RAMP system was valid.  His February 2019 RAMP election form clearly and unambiguously expressed his intent to withdraw from the legacy system.  While the Board historically rejected RAMP applications received after activation of the appeal by the Board, the Board had not yet received his appeal when the RAMP election was received, and it had not activated his appeal when the withdrawal was effectuated.  Both the Veteran and his representative were notified that the RAMP election had been accepted and that the legacy appeal had been withdrawn via a March 2019 letter.  They were further notified of the RAMP acceptance via the August 2019 RAMP rating decision adjudicating the claim and in September 2020 when the Veteran's attorney sought clarification.  No disagreement with the withdrawal was expressed until December 2021, more than one year after such notification of the AOJ's actions.  For these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's withdrawal of his legacy appeal in the RAMP system was valid.

The Board finds that an effective date earlier than August 18, 2022 is not warranted for the Veteran's increased rating for PTSD.  His August 2022 supplemental claim was received more than one year after his rating was last adjudicated in the August 2019 rating decision.  No good cause for this delay has been argued or shown, and as such he has not continuously pursued his claim prior to his claim date of August 18, 2022.  Furthermore, neither the Veteran nor his representative have identified evidence of a worsening that occurred within the year prior to the Veteran's August 2022 claim, and his VA treatment records show stable symptoms throughout that period with no notable worsening.  For these reasons, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than August 18, 2022 is not warranted for the Veteran's increased rating for PTSD.

2. Whether a reduction in evaluation of right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome based on limitation of flexion from 10 percent to 0 percent was proper

The Veteran disputes the reduction of his right knee disability rating based on limitation of flexion.

On May 12, 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim for an increased rating for his right knee disability.  A September 2023 rating decision awarded a 10 percent rating based on limitation of extension and reduced his 10 percent rating for limitation of flexion to 0 percent.  The evaluations ordered in that rating decision were not accurately reflected in the Veteran's Rating Code sheet, but this error was corrected in an October 2023 rating decision.  After further development, the Veteran's ratings were continued in a November 2023 rating decision.  His June 2024 notice of disagreement, however, disputes the propriety of the reduction in the September 2023 rating decision.  Therefore, for this issue, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision.

Prior to submitting his June 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran submitted a January 2024 request for higher-level review (HLR) for this issue.  A May 2024 HLR decision denied his claim.  In his notice of disagreement, the Veteran identified the September 2023 rating decision as the decision on appeal.  This election to appeal the prior rating decisions has no effect on the issues before the Board or the applicable window for submission of evidence.  The only effect of this election is that the time to switch appeal dockets has lapsed, and the Board may adjudicate his appeal without waiver.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Disability evaluations are determined by application of the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  An evaluation of the level of disability present must also include consideration of the functional impairment of the Veteran's ability to engage in ordinary activities, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  

Prior to May 12, 2023, the Veteran was in receipt of a 10 percent rating for his right knee disability based on limitation of flexion under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.  Under this code, flexion of the leg is rated noncompensable when limited to 60 degrees, 10 percent when limited to 45 degrees, 20 percent when limited to 30 degrees, and 30 percent when limited to 15 degrees.  

Effective May 12, 2023, the Veteran's rating based on limitation of flexion was reduced to 0 percent, and he was instead awarded a 10 percent rating based on limitation of extension under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.  Under this code, extension of the leg is rated noncompensable when limited to 5 degrees, 10 percent when limited to 10 degrees, 20 percent when limited to 15 degrees, 30 percent when limited to 20 degrees, 40 percent when limited to 30 degrees, and 50 percent when limited to 45 degrees.  

Painful motion with joint pathology is productive of disability and entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

Service connection for a right knee disability was initially granted in a December 2012 legacy rating decision which assigned a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5260 based on the findings at an August 2012 VA examination.  At this examination, flexion was limited to 120 degrees with pain thereat.  Extension was full to 0 degrees without objective evidence of pain.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his right knee in June 2023.  He reported knee pain and limited range of motion.  Current treatment involved use of a knee brace.  Flare ups were described as moderate, lasting a few minutes, and occurring ten times per month.  Flare-ups were treated by over the counter medications.  He described difficulties with prolonged standing, walking, and repetitive weight bearing.  He neither reported nor had a history of instability, recurrent subluxation, or frequent effusion.  Flexion was limited to 110 degrees and extension was full to 0 degrees.  Pain was noted in weight bearing and in both ranges of active and passive motion.  There was evidence of crepitus.  There was no evidence of pain on palpation.  Repetitive testing did not lead to additional loss of function or range.  The examiner determined that repeated use over time would further reduce flexion to 100 degrees.  The examiner determined that flare-ups would reduce flexion to 60 degrees and extension to 10 degrees.  There was no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, instability, tibial or fibular impairment, or meniscal conditions.  Residuals of a 2017 knee surgery consisted of pain and decreased motion.  He was diagnosed with right knee osteoarthritis.

In a June 2024 brief, the Veteran's representative argued that his reduction in rating was inappropriate because his symptoms still warranted a 10 percent rating based on painful motion under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59.  The representative argued that the examination did not show any improvement, and as such a reduction was erroneous as a matter of law.

The Board finds that the Veteran's change in knee diagnostic code is not a reduction governed by 38 C.F.R. § 3.344.  Rather, his right knee remains rated at 10 percent, with merely a change in diagnostic code.  The selection of a particular Diagnostic Code "is a determination that is completely dependent upon the facts of a particular case," and the Board has discretion in determining the appropriate Diagnostic Code. Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993) (applying the more deferential "arbitrary, capricious" standard, rather than de novo review, to the Board's determination of the appropriate Diagnostic Code).  

The 10 percent rating under 5260 was based on findings of painful motion under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 as the minimum compensable evaluation for limited motion of a joint.  Such a rating is impermissible in conjunction with a compensable rating under 5261 for limited motion of the same joint.  His June 2023 examination showed that he met the criteria for a 10 percent rating based on the functional equivalent of limitation of extension to 10 degrees or more.  There is no evidence, and the Veteran does not contend, that he meets the criteria for a compensable rating under 5260 without § 4.59, specifically limitation of flexion to 45 degrees or less or the functional equivalent thereof. 

The protections of § 3.344 are applicable to reductions based on showings of improvement, but there was no improvement here.  The Veteran remains compensated for his painful motion of the knees; that compensation has simply been assigned to a different code to allow for a higher percentage.  But see Murray v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 420 (2011) (finding that a change in diagnostic code constitutes a reduction where the new diagnostic code does not contemplate the resolved symptomatology contemplated by the prior diagnostic code).  Because he now meets the criteria for limited motion of the right knee, continuing the 10 percent rating for flexion along with the 10 percent rating for extension would be improper pyramiding.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  

For these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's change in knee diagnostic code is not a reduction governed by 38 C.F.R. § 3.344.  Restoration of a 10 percent rating based on limitation of flexion is therefore denied.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability

The Veteran claims service connection for a left knee disability.

On May 12, 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for a left knee disability.  A September 2023 rating decision denied service connection.  An October 2023 rating decision provided additional laws and regulations but did not consider additional evidence.  Therefore, for this issue, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision.

Prior to submitting his June 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran submitted a January 2024 request for higher-level review (HLR) for this issue.  A May 2024 HLR decision denied his claim.  In his notice of disagreement, the Veteran identified the September 2023 rating decision as the decision on appeal.  This election to appeal the prior rating decisions has no effect on the issues before the Board or the applicable window for submission of evidence.  The only effect of this election is that the time to switch appeal dockets has lapsed, and the Board may adjudicate his appeal without waiver.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection requires:  (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection may be awarded on a secondary basis if a claimant suffers a disability that is "proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury."  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); but see Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023).  For "aggravation of non-service-connected disabilities" it is enough to show that a non-service-connected disability would have been less severe but-for a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.

For certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, a presumption of service connection arises if the disease is manifested to a degree of 10 percent within one year following discharge from service.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).  When a chronic disease is not shown to have manifested to a compensable degree within one year after service, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support a claim for such diseases; however, such continuity of symptomatology may only support a claim for those chronic diseases listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the claimant prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.

Service treatment records do not reflect any symptoms of or treatment for a left knee disability.  No such abnormality was noted at the Veteran's June 2011 separation examination.  In the accompanying report of medical history, he described a history of right knee pain, but did not mention his left knee.  

VA treatment records reflect that in May 2021 the Veteran reported left knee pain and swelling for two days.  He denied injury.  In July 2022 he reported that he saw an orthopedist for left knee pain.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that a left knee disability is related to service, is related to a service-connected disability, or manifested within one year of separation from service.  There is no evidence in the record of a left knee disability until May 2021, nearly ten years after separation from service.  There is nothing in the record to indicate any in-service event, disease, or injury, nor is there anything in the record indicating a relationship to service or a service-connected disability.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have offered evidence or argument explaining why he believes that his left knee disability is eligible for service connection.  He has not been afforded a VA examination, but absent any indication of a relationship to service or evidence of an in-service event, disease, or injury, VA has no duty to provide one.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that a left knee disability is related to service, is related to a service-connected disability, or manifested within one year of separation from service.  Service connection is therefore denied.

4. Entitlement to a TDIU, to include referral for extraschedular consideration

The Veteran seeks a TDIU.  He contends that his service-connected disabilities, when considered in combination, render him unemployable.

The Veteran submitted a claim for a TDIU in May 2017.  This claim was not adjudicated until the November 2023 rating decision on appeal.  Therefore, for this issue, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision.

Total disability means that there is present any impairment of mind or body sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  38?C.F.R. §§?3.340, 4.15.

Substantially gainful employment is defined as work which is more than marginal and permits the individual to earn a living wage.  Moore v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App. 356 (1991).  Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a facts-found basis (including, but not limited to, employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop), when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  

The term "substantially gainful occupation" has two components: an economic one and a noneconomic one.? Ray v. Wilkie, 31?Vet. App.?58?(2019).  In assessing a claimant's ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, the Board is to consider the claimant's history, education, skill, and training as well as physical abilities and mental abilities required by the occupation at issue. ?Id.? Such specific physical ability factors include lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, reaching, auditory, and visual. ?Id.? Specific mental ability factors include memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, getting along with coworkers, and demonstrating reliability and productivity.? Id. 

A claimant is totally disabled if his service-connected disability or combination of service-connected disabilities is rated at 100 percent pursuant to the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38?C.F.R. §?3.340(a)(2).  Even if a claimant is less than 100 percent disabled, he still is deemed totally disabled under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities if he satisfies two requirements.  38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a).  First, the claimant must meet a minimum percent evaluation.  If he has one service-connected disability, it must be evaluated at 60 percent or more.  If he has two or more service-connected disabilities, at least one disability must be evaluated at 40 percent or more and the combined evaluation of all the disabilities must be 70 percent or more.  The following will be considered as one disability with respect to the minimum percent evaluation: (1) disabilities of one or both upper extremities or of one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable, (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident, (3) disabilities affecting a single body system (e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric), (4) multiple injuries incurred in action, or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war.  Second, the claimant must be found to be unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disability or disabilities.  Id. 

Where a claimant does not meet the percentage evaluation requirements under 4.16(a), he still may be deemed totally disabled on an extraschedular basis under 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b) when the evidence nonetheless indicates that the claimant is unemployable by reason of his service-connected disabilities.  Under such circumstance the matter is referred to the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service ("Director") for consideration.  Id.; see also Bagwell v. Brown, 9?Vet. App.?337 (1996); Floyd v. Brown, 9?Vet. App.?88 (1996); Shipwash v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?218 (1995).  Extraschedular TDIU consideration requires contemplation of the following factors:  severity of the claimant's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue.  38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b).  Although the Board does not have the authority to award an extraschedular TDIU prior to referral to the Director, the Board has jurisdiction to review and award extraschedular ratings in claims that have been denied by the Director.  See Kuppamala v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?447 (2015). 

In determining whether a TDIU is warranted, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the claimant prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38?U.S.C. §?5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant. 

When the Veteran submitted his May 2017 claim, he was in receipt of a 30 percent rating for PTSD, a 10 percent rating for plantar fasciitis, a 10 percent rating for tinnitus, a 10 percent rating for his right knee disability, and three noncompensable ratings for right ear hearing loss, migraine headaches, and residuals of a traumatic brain injury (TBI).  His combined schedular rating was 50 percent, and he therefore did not meet the eligibility threshold for a schedular TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Effective August 18, 2022, his PTSD was increased to 70 percent, increasing his combined schedular rating to 80 percent.  Effective December 2022, his migraine headaches rating was increased to 50 percent, increasing his combined schedular rating to 90 percent.  He therefore met the eligibility threshold for a schedular TDIU effective August 18, 2022.  The Board thus must determine both whether a schedular TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) is warranted from August 18, 2022, and whether referral is warranted for consideration of an extraschedular TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) for the period prior to August 18, 2022.

Social Security Administration (SSA) records include an April 2013 disability determination and transmittal finding that the Veteran was not disabled.

VA treatment records reflect that in May 2017 the Veteran reported that he was working as a nursing aide at a group home.

In his May 2017 application for a TDIU, the Veteran reported that his PTSD had rendered him unemployable since 2014.  At that time, he worked full time as a delivery driver.  Since then, he again worked full time as a nursing assistant from February 2016 to July 2016.  He stated that he did not leave his most recent job because of his disability.  He reported one year of college education.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his PTSD in June 2017.  He reported that he was currently employed as a nursing assistant at a group home and had been employed there for the prior three years.  He was enrolled at school, working towards an associate degree in nursing.  The examiner noted symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks more than once per week, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, and disturbance of motivation or mood.  He was diagnosed with PTSD productive of occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation.  

VA treatment records reflect that in July 2017 and September 2017 the Veteran reported that he continued to work as a nursing aide at a group home and attend classes for nursing.  In December 2017 he reported that he continued to work but was dismissed from school for poor academic performance.

The Veteran submitted an August 2018 evaluation by a private psychologist based on review of the record and videoconference interview.  The psychologist opined that the Veteran's PTSD and depression symptoms have ultimately rendered him fully unable to successfully secure and follow substantially gainful employment since at least August 2011.  The psychologist noted that the Veteran had maintained employment for approximately four years but indicated that his success in maintaining his position had been in large part based on the accommodations that his employer made for him.  He stated that when he is having a bad day, they allow him to have the day off.

In an October 2018 statement, the Veteran's spouse stated that his mental health disability makes it extremely difficult for him to get by at work.  She believed that he was only able to work because of the adjustments his supervisors made for him.  She explained that the staff and supervisors at the group home were aware of his issues and would change his workload or schedule to help him.  

VA treatment records reflect that in October 2018 the Veteran reported that he continued to work a lot of hours at the group home.  In March 2019 and July 2019, he reported that he continued to work at the group home full time and overtime but was considering a new job.  In December 2019 he reported that he was working full time at Walmart and liked it.  In April 2020 he stated he was working a lot of hours at Walmart.  In November 2020 he reported that he was off work for a couple weeks due to a pandemic quarantine.  In December 2020 he reported that work remained enjoyable.  In March 2021 he reported that he was still working at Walmart but was looking and applying for other jobs.  In April 2021 he reported that he was about to start a new job at Lowe's.  In May 2021 he stated that he liked his new job.  In July 2021 he reported that things did not work out at Lowe's and that he had returned to Walmart.  He continued to report working at Walmart in August 2021, October 2021, and November 2021.  In January 2022 and February 2022, he reported that work was okay.  He reported that he continued to work at Walmart in March 2022.  In July 2022 he reported that he quit his job at Walmart and now worked for a company making rental deliveries.

In an August 2022 statement, the Veteran reported that although he maintained a job at a nursing home for almost four years, his mother was the manager of the facility, and her friend was his supervisor.  He stated that many of his work infractions and confrontations with coworkers were overlooked and explained away as complications of his disability, so he was given unofficial accommodations.  When his mother resigned, he found he was expected to perform to a different standard.  He stated that he quit in 2018.  After that, he stated that he had an on and off job at Walmart until he quit in May 2022.  He then got a job as a customer service agent and delivery person in June 2022.  

In another August 2022 statement, the Veteran's mother stated that when he first came home from the military, she got him a job at a group home she was managing.  He was assigned the midnight shift to minimize his contact with coworkers due to his demeanor.  She stated that she was unsure how he would manage his new job in a customer service role due to his moodiness.

VA treatment records reflect that in October 2022 the Veteran reported that he continued to work at the rental center and found this job to be better due to the daytime hours.  In January 2023 he reported that he continued to work there.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination or his PTSD in March 2023.  He reported that he had worked at the rental center for one year.  He described instances where he was late to work due to insomnia.  The examiner noted symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, impairment of short and long-term memory, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty adapting to stress, and impaired impulse control.  He was diagnosed with PTSD productive of occupational and social impairment in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his headaches in April 2023.  The examiner diagnosed migraine headaches with very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.

VA treatment records reflect that in April 2023 the Veteran reported that he continued to work at the rental center, full time in the delivery truck.  He stated that he generally enjoys his job.  He reported the same in June 2023.  In July 2023, he reported that he was working 40 hours per week at the rental center as well as 32 hours a week for Papa John's.  He stated that working two jobs kept him out of trouble.  In November 2023 he elaborated that his new job was manager of a pizza shop.  He stated that he liked this job better and got better pay.

In a June 2024 brief, the Veteran's representative stated that the Veteran was currently not working.  The representative argued for a TDIU based on the August 2018 private opinion.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have rendered him unemployable or unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, and for the period prior to August 18, 2022, the evidence does not substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was rendered unemployable by his service-connected disabilities.  

Specifically, the Veteran has remained employed for essentially the entirety of the period on appeal.  His August 2022 lay statements and the August 2018 opinion of the private psychologist argue that his work as a nursing aide was marginal employment because it was in a sheltered environment, where accommodations were made by the manager, his mother.  While there is evidence that his work at that time was marginal, the question before the Board is not whether he was employed in a sheltered environment but whether he is capable of employment in a non-sheltered environment.  Subsequent evidence clearly shows that he was capable of such employment, as he was employed by corporate entities such as Walmart and Papa John's with no indication of sheltered status.  Indeed, in 2023 he reported that he was working two jobs, totalling 72 hours a week, and that he enjoyed them.  

The Board recognizes that the June 2024 brief stated that the Veteran was currently unemployed, but the brief identified no evidence to support this argument that could be considered by the Board, and treatment records less than a month before the November 2023 rating decision on appeal indicate that he was fully employed at that time.  

For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have rendered him unemployable or unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, and for the period prior to August 18, 2022, the evidence does not substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was rendered unemployable by his service-connected disabilities.  A TDIU is therefore denied.
