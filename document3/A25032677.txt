REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, had active service in the U.S. Army from November 2004 to July 2012.        

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from an October 2023 decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO); the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

1. The appeal challenging the propriety of the removal of the Veteran's spouse, I., as a dependent effective October 1, 2023, is dismissed.

2. The appeal challenging the propriety of the removal of the Veteran's child, E., as a dependent effective October 1, 2023, is dismissed.

The Veteran has challenged an October 13, 2023, determination by the AOJ that removed her spouse, I., and child, E., from her VA compensation award effective October 1, 2023, because it stated that she failed to verify her dependency information.  On October 26, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 686c, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, and VA Form 21-674, Request for Approval of School Attendance, verifying her dependency information as requested.  Consequently, in a March 21, 2024, letter, VA advised the Veteran that her spouse and child were reestablished as dependents for the purpose of additional VA compensation benefits effective the date of their removal, October 1, 2023.  This action by the AOJ constitutes a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal with regard to the Veteran's dependency claim.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105.  In the present case, the benefits sought on appeal regarding the dependency claim have been granted in full.  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
