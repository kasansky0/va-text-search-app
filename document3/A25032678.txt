FINDING OF FACT

On February 18, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from January 1970 to September 1971. He served in the Republic of Vietnam, and his military decorations include the Combat Infantryman Badge.

In an October 2020 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) continued the Veteran's 70 percent rating for PTSD; granted service connection for hypertension and assigned a noncompensable rating effective June 9, 2020; and granted service connection for migraines including migraine variants and assigned a noncompensable rating effective June 9, 2020. In September 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request:  Higher-Level Review. In October 2021, the AOJ issued a higher-level review rating decision. In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal. In October 2022, he withdrew his Board appeal and submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request:  Supplemental Claim. In a January 2023 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 70 percent rating for PTSD and the noncompensable rating for hypertension. The AOJ also increased the Veteran's migraines including migraine variants rating to 50 percent effective October 24, 2022. 

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 appealing the ratings for PTSD, hypertension, and migraines including migraine variants. The Veteran also raised the issue of TDIU. In December 2024, the AOJ granted TDIU effective November 17, 2010.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In the present case, in February 2025, the Veteran requested dismissal of the issues appealed on the August 2023 VA Form 10182. He specifically listed the issues he wished to withdraw and stated that he was withdrawing the issues listed on the August 2023 VA Form 10182. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran unambiguously expressed his desire to withdraw the current appeals and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for the Board to consider. The Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it must be dismissed.
