ORDER

Service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is denied.

REMANDED

Service connection for hypertension is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a psychiatric disorder at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1978 to October 1998.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in February 2024 and March 2024; the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Regarding hypertension, the Veteran listed the date of the rating decision that was being appealed as June 2013. The Board observes that service connection for hypertension was originally denied in an unappealed June 2013 rating decision, which is final and not eligible for appeal at this time. Although the VA Form 10182 lists that decision, the Board liberally construes the VA Form 10182 to appeal the February 2024 rating decision that denied hypertension. The Veteran's representative also provided an appellate brief after the VA Form 10182 and indicated that the February 2024 rating decision was being contested. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim of service connection for a psychiatric disability, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for hypertension, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Veteran submitted the claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder using a signed VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits. He submitted the claim for service connection for hypertension using a signed VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application.

The complete VA Form 21-526EZ includes 'Notice to Veteran/Service Member of Evidence Necessary to Substantiate a Claim for Veterans Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.' The complete VA Form 20-0995 form includes 'Information and Instructions for Completing Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.' These parts of the forms contain explicit notice to the claimant that "You are entitled to a hearing at any time in the claims process. If you wish to have a hearing or have other questions, contact VA online through Ask VA: https://ask.va.gov or call us toll-free at 1-800-827-1000 (TTY:711)." By signing the VA Form 21-526EZ and VA Form 20-0995, the Veteran certified they received the notice attached to their applications. Therefore, the Board finds that he was provided with notice of his right to a hearing before the AOJ issued its initial decisions on appeal.

1. Service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood reportedly caused by deployments overseas including to the Republic of Korea, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Republic of the Sudan. See October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) because his personnel records show service in Saudi Arabia. The AOJ also found that the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service because his service treatment records show treatment for mental health conditions. Therefore, the first question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current psychiatric disability.

A January 1999 VA general medical examination report indicates the Veteran was clinically stable. 

A January 1999 VA mental disorders examination report indicates the Veteran reported a psychiatric episode in 1994 but denied any other episodes. He indicated that there was some alcohol use prior to the 1994 episode. The Veteran denied any outstanding problems and reported functioning adequately. The January 1999 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran is essentially currently without a mental disorder. The examiner acknowledged that the Veteran shows some evidence of mild underlying anxiety but adequately copes with these occasional moods. 

October 2000, August 2001, and December 2001 VA treatment records indicate the Veteran denied depression. 

A June 2007 VA treatment record notes negative screening tests for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. See also January 2007 VA treatment record.

A February 2010 VA treatment record notes a negative depression screening test; however, a February 2010 VA treatment record also indicates the Veteran reported depression/anxiety but denied a mental health consult. The Veteran reported being "fearful of things" and having "a little depression" that comes and goes. He indicated that he has had a new job during this period and has some marital stress. The record indicates a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood was made in February 2010.

A March 2010 VA treatment record notes depression; however, June 2011 and January 2012 VA treatment records reflect negative PTSD and depression screenings. See also October 2013 VA treatment record. A May 2012 VA treatment record notes a past medical history of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressive mood. 

A May 2016 VA treatment record indicates the Veteran denied depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and insomnia. A July 2017 VA treatment record also indicates the Veteran denied depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and insomnia but reported memory loss/forgetfulness and adjustment disorder.

An April 2018 private treatment record notes the Veteran has a history of depression and anxiety. 

A July 2018 VA treatment record notes "depression + adjustment d/o." During the July 2018 VA appointment, the Veteran reported being depressed but declined medication and counseling. A July 2018 VA treatment record also notes a negative screen for depression. 

A September 2020 VA treatment record indicates the Veteran is oriented and without obvious signs of dementia, psychosis, severe thought disorders, and thoughts of harming self or others. 

A July 2021 private treatment record indicates the Veteran denied loss of motivation, nervousness, suicidal ideation, and trouble sleeping. 

A September 2021 VA treatment record indicates the Veteran is oriented and denies thoughts of harming self or others. An October 2021 VA treatment record indicates the Veteran is awake, alert, and oriented. A March 2022 VA treatment record indicates the Veteran has an appropriate affect and does not have mental impairments that increase his risk of harm to self or others.

A July 2022 private treatment record also indicates that the Veteran is oriented to time, place, and person with active, alert, and normal affect. He also displayed good judgment.  

August 2023 and September 2023 VA treatment records indicate the Veteran is oriented without signs of dementia, psychosis, severe thought disorders, and/or thoughts of harming self or others.

The Veteran filed the instant service connection claim in October 2023.

The Veteran underwent a VA mental disorders examination in November 2023. The examiner noted a history of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood but noted no current mental disorder diagnosis. During the examination, the Veteran denied significant mental health complaints, mood disturbances, or symptoms. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's adjustment disorder is not presently diagnosed. 

After a review of the evidentiary record, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current psychiatric disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). 

The November 2023 VA examiner evaluated the Veteran and determined that, while he experienced subjective psychiatric symptoms in the past, he does not currently have a diagnosed psychiatric disorder. While the Veteran believes there is a currently diagnosed psychiatric disorder, he is not competent to provide such a medically complex diagnosis, which requires specialized medical education and the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing. Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 4-5 (2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The examiner's assessment is probative because he is a psychologist, who conducted a telehealth examination, and stated that all available records were reviewed, and findings considered when completing this examination report.

Although the Veteran's post-service treatment records reflect a 2010 diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, the Board notes that the Veteran's treatment records generally reflect negative screening tests for depression and PTSD thereafter. Similarly, to the extent his treatment records reflect depression and anxiety, the diagnoses generally appear to be based on the Veteran's self-reported medical history rather than a disability diagnosed by a competent medical professional. Moreover, the Veteran's reports of symptoms are internally inconsistent as he alternatively reports psychiatric symptoms and denies mental health complaints, mood disturbances, or symptoms. Most importantly, there is not a diagnosed psych disorder shown in the records since he filed his service connection claim in October 2023.

Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the VA examination findings, specifically the November 2023 VA examination. The November 2023 VA examiner determined that, while the Veteran was previously diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, the Veteran does not have a current psychiatric disability. 

In reaching this conclusion, the Board acknowledges that for purposes of establishing service connection, a "current disability" includes a disability that existed at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of the claim, even if that disability is currently in remission or has completely resolved. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). The Board also acknowledges that it must address any evidence of a disability that predates the date of claim for benefits when determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency. See Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. at 293-94 (considering the application of McClain on a diagnosis predating the filing of a claim). The Court in Romanowsky further indicated that a determination that a diagnosis is "sufficiently proximate to the filing of a claim so as to constitute evidence of a 'current diagnosis' is a factual finding to be made by the Board in the first instance." Id. at 294 n.3. 

In this case, the Board finds that the Veteran's 2010 diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is not proximate to this claim, which was filed in October 2023, and does not constitute evidence of a current diagnosis. 

In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for a psychiatric disability is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for hypertension is remanded.

The Veteran contends his hypertension onset during service or is otherwise related to service including participation in a TERA. 

In compliance with the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), the AOJ obtained a January 2024 VA examination and opinion. The January 2024 VA examiner diagnosed hypertension but opined that it is less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA. The examiner noted that there is no available individual longitudinal exposure record (ILER) such that there are no identifiable toxic exposure risk activities that caused hypertension. 

Although the record indicates that a detailed ILER is not available for the Veteran, the Veteran's military personnel records indicate he served in Saudi Arabi in 1995. As the January 2024 VA examiner provided a conclusory rationale to negate a nexus between the Veteran's hypertension and the identified TERA. Therefore, a remand to obtain an adequate medical opinion compliant with 38 U.S.C. § 1168 and supported by a fully-explained rationale is necessary. Accordingly, on remand, an addendum opinion must be obtained. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's hypertension is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to the Veteran's in-service exposure to toxins due to service in Saudi Arabia. 

The examiner must provide a fully-explained rationale for all proffered opinions. When providing this opinion, the examiner must consider: 1) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and 2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. If the requested opinions cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the examiner should provide an explanation as to why speculation is required.
