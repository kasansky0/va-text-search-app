ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 4, 2022, for the grant of entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim for entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance was received by VA on August 4, 2022.

2. August 4, 2022, is the earliest factually ascertainable date when the Veteran demonstrated a need for the regular aid and attendance of another person due to service-connected disability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to August 4, 2022, for the grant of entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114 (l), 5107, 5110 (b)(2)(C)(3); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.352, 3.400 (o)(2), 3.402 (c)(1).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1985 to October 1993.

On February 2, 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review a January 31, 2024 rating decision issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 31, 2024, AOJ decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding all issues on appeal as described on the title page, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 4, 2022, for the grant of entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance ("SMC L-1").

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to August 4, 2022 for the grant of entitlement to SMC L-1.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the record of this case consists of a large number of documents, with at least 189 VA Form 10182's received by VA since May of 2019. Many of the documents in the Veteran's claims file are duplicative. 

A.	Legal Criteria

SMC is an additional level of compensation paid to veterans above the basic levels of compensation for various types of losses or levels of impairment solely due to service-connected disabilities. It reflects recognition by VA that certain disabilities, either alone or in combination, have an impact on a veteran beyond the impairment of earning capacity, which is central to the Rating Schedule. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Because it considers the interactive effects of multiple disabilities, a determination of the correct SMC award level requires layering of different entitlements. Basic levels of SMC are listed at 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k). Additional levels of SMC are provided in 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) through (t). Only the additional level pertinent to the Veteran's claim is discussed herein.

SMC is payable at the (l) rate (SMC L-1) if a veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has an anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, or of one hand and one foot; has blindness in both eyes with visual acuity of 5/200 or less; is permanently bedridden or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance of another person. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (b).

The following will be accorded consideration in determining the need for regular aid and attendance: inability of claimant to dress or undress himself, or to keep himself ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid; inability of claimant to feed himself through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to his daily environment. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a).

At least one of the above disabling factors needs to be met to receive SMC based on required aid and attendance. See Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222, 224 (1996); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a). The particular personal functions that the veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his condition as a whole. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a). It is only necessary that the evidence establish the veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there is a constant need. Id. The performance of the necessary aid and attendance service by a relative or other member of the veteran's household will not prevent a favorable determination. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (c).

With respect to the effective date of the award of a higher level of SMC, the Board notes that claims for SMC are by definition a type of increased (i.e., "special") compensation. Thus, claims for earlier effective dates for SMC are treated analogously to claims for earlier effective dates for increased ratings.

In general, the effective date of an award of an increased rating shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application thereof. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a). An exception to this rule applies, however, under circumstances where evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation. In that regard, the law provides that the effective date of the award "shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date otherwise, date of receipt of the claim." 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2)(C)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

B.	Facts and Analysis

The Veteran was granted SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) based on housebound status effective August 4, 2022. See March 2025 Rating Decision - Codesheet. 

The February 2, 2024, VA Form 10182 presently before the Board refers to the effective date assigned by the January 31, 2024, AOJ rating decision. The January 31, 2024, AOJ rating decision corrected an erroneously issued October 30, 2023, rating decision which denied entitlement to SMC-L1. See January 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative. It is unclear to the Board why the AOJ issued the October 30, 2023, erroneous rating decision. The Board notes that the October 30, 2023, rating decision refers to a claim received on March 3, 2023. See October 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative.  During that time, the Veteran was already in receipt of SMC-L1, which was granted to the Veteran in a December 2022 AOJ rating decision, with an effective date of August 4, 2022. See December 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative. 

Thus, in correcting the erroneous October 30, 2023, decision, the rating decision on appeal reaffirmed that August 4, 2022, effective date of the Veteran's initial grant of SMC-L1, and it is this reaffirmation that is currently on appeal. The Veteran thus contends that he is entitled to a higher level of SMC, as provided by 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l), based on the need for regular aid and attendance prior to August 4, 2022, which is the date initially assigned by the AOJ and reaffirmed by the January 31, 2024, AOJ decision currently on appeal.

The Board notes that the Veteran's initial claim for SMC L-1 was received on August 4, 2022. See August 2022 VA 21-2680 Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Aid and Attendance. The Board can locate no claim for entitlement to SMC L-1 earlier than August 4, 2022, in the record. Applying the general rule for effective date of an increased rating claim, the Board must determine which is the later of (1) the date the Veteran's initial claim for SMC L-1 was received, or (2) the date, up to one year prior to August 4, 2022, that it became factually ascertainable that the Veteran met the criteria for SMC L-1. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). 

The Board finds, based on the analysis above, that documents describing the Veteran's symptoms and needs prior to August 4, 2021, are not relevant to the instant appeal because 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2) does not allow an effective date prior to this. The Board further finds that documents describing the Veterans symptoms and needs after August 4, 2022, are also not relevant, as the Veteran has been in receipt of SMC L-1 from that time, rendering any such inquiry moot. Thus, the pertinent evidence in this case is that which describes whether the Veteran had a medical need for aid and attendance between August 4, 2021; and August 4, 2022. The Board will discuss this evidence in light of the applicable law cited above, and, although the Board has reviewed all of the evidence, the Board will not discuss the irrelevant evidence. See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.App. 589, 593 (1991) (Board is only required to consider "potentially applicable" provisions of law); Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (Board must only discuss that evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal); Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Board does not have to discuss each piece of evidence it considers when deciding a claim); Hyatt v. Nicholson, 21 Vet.App. 390, 396 (2007) (defining relevant evidence as "evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence").

Although the record contains more than 500 documents received from August 4, 2021, to August 4, 2022, many are duplicative and very few contain medical or lay evidence documenting the Veteran's symptoms between August 4, 2021; and August 4, 2022. Many of the submissions consisted of older pieces of evidence re-submitted by the Veteran numerous times without explanation.

On his August 4, 2022, application for SMC L-1, the examiner opined that the Veteran could not prepare meals for himself and required assistance with bathing and other hygiene needs. See August 2022 VA 21-2680. The Veteran was noted to require help with medication because of pain in his hands while opening and closing medications. Id. The examiner noted that the Veteran had "antalgic gait low back pain with walking multiple joint arthritis." Id.

After careful review of the Veteran's VA treatment records, the Board can locate no evidence of symptoms such as these prior to the August 4, 2022, VA 21-2680. For example, slightly more than one year before the Veteran's application for SMC L-1, the Veteran presented at a primary care annual exam in July 2021, and at that time, no difficulty with eating, bathing, hygiene, or tending his own medications was noted. See March 2023 CAPRI at 283. Arthritic pain was noted but did not appear at that time to confine the Veteran to his bed or render him helpless. Id. In June 2021, a psychiatry note showed that the Veteran reported "doing ok," having a better mood, being cooperative, and being motivated. Id at 313. One year later, at a June 1, 2022, annual exam, the Veteran still presented no obvious (or subtle) signs of either being bedridden or requiring aid and attendance. Id at 146. The Veteran's provider observed the Veteran's chronic and acute health conditions and entered notes regarding many of them but did not discuss any need for bed rest; confinement to bed; or concerns about the Veteran's ability to feed, bathe, tend to other personal needs, or take medications himself. Id.

A July 28, 2022, primary care note indicates that at that time, the Veteran ambulated into the primary care clinic without assistive devices. See September 2022 CAPRI at 29. The Veteran presented without an appointment with an "Aid & Attendance" form requesting it to be signed by a provider. Id. The Veteran's gait was observed to be steady and he showed no signs of acute distress. Id. The Veteran stated that the form was already filled out and he just needed a provider to sign it. VA staff advised the Veteran to leave the form for review by the provider, but the Veteran refused, stating "No, I don't want anything to happen to it, my son died and I have six kids to raise. I will just take it over to the PA office and have this straightened out." Id. A note on August 3, 2022, shows that a nurse called the Veteran on that day in response to a request from the Veteran for follow-up to the pre-filled request for Aid and Attendance that the Veteran had provided. Id at 26. The nurse informed the Veteran that the provider had reviewed the Veteran's medical record and determined that the Veteran did not qualify for the program. Id. The Veteran submitted the August 4, 2022, VA 21-2680 the next day, signed by a private practitioner, "[C.R.]." See August 2022 VA 21-2680, Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance.

The Board notes that the Veteran's VA treatment records are extensive, spanning decades and thousands of pages. See, e.g, March 2023 CAPRI. The Board can locate no meaningful treatment records in the Veteran's extensive file that originated from [C.R.]. To the extent the [C.R.] VA 21-2680 opines that the Veteran needed aid and attendance prior to August 4, 2022, the Board assigns it no probative weight, and instead assigns higher probative weight to the contemporaneous treatment records from that time. See Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (1997) (finding Board entitled to discount the credibility of evidence in light of its own inherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of evidence); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999) (statements made for treatment purposes carry greater probative value than statements made for disability compensation purpose); D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet.App. 97, 107 (2008) (it is within the purview of the Board to evaluate the medical evidence and favor one medical opinion over another). However, the Board notes that the [C.R.] VA 21-2680 does not expressly opine at all as to the Veteran's need for regular aid and attendance prior to August 4, 2022.

The Board has reviewed the lay statements submitted by the Veteran during the year prior to August 4, 2022, but finds that they do not provide meaningful evidence regarding the Veteran's ability to feed himself, bathe himself, and perform other basic activities of daily living. As such, the Board finds that these statements are not probative to the issue of an effective date for SMC L-1 prior to August 4, 2022.

The Board has reviewed the three VA examinations of record that occurred between August 4, 2021; and August 4, 2022. The first of these was a September 2021 VA examination concerning hearing loss and tinnitus. See September 2021 C&P Exam. The next occurred in September 2021 and concerned sleep apnea. See September 2021 C&P Exam. The third concerned an ankle condition and also occurred in September 2021. See September 2021 C&P Exam. Although each of these examinations describes some degree of functional impairment, none of them suggest a need for aid and attendance.

In sum, the Board can locate no meaningful evidence prior to the August 4, 2022, VA 21-2680 that suggests the Veteran demonstrated a need for the regular aid and attendance of another person due to service-connected disability prior to that date. As August 4, 2022, is also the date the Veteran's claim was received, there is no other date that can be assigned under applicable regulations. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the weight of the competent and probative evidence does not support entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l), based on the need for regular aid and attendance prior to August 4, 2022. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for his grant of entitlement to SMC L-1 is denied. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).
