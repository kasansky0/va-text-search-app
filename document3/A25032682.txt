ORDER

An effective date prior to August 1, 2023, for payment of dependency compensation for the Veteran's minor child, A.R., is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's minor child, A.R., was born in 2008.

2. The Veteran did not notify the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs of A.R.'s birth until December 2023, following an award of compensation benefits associated with a July 2023 application for benefits. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to August 1, 2023, for payment of dependency compensation for the Veteran's minor child, A.R., are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1115, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.31, 3.204, 3.261, 3.401.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from June 1984 until his honorable discharge in October 2006.

This appeal is being adjudicated according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

By way of background, the Veteran became service connected for multiple disabilities, rated as 30 percent disabling when combined, effective November 1, 2006. March 30, 2007, Rating Decision. He received notification of that decision on May 9, 2007, via written correspondence.

On July 26, 2023, he filed a Notice of Intent to file a claim. On July 27, 2023, he filed a new claim for service connection and claims for increased ratings for his service-connected disabilities. A Regional Office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issued a Rating Decision on December 4, 2023, addressing his claims. 

On December 5, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-686c (Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents). He sought to add his minor child, A.R., as a dependent for compensation purposes. In a December 5, 2023, Notification Letter, the VA Regional Office informed the Veteran of the December 4, 2023, Rating Decision. In a December 6, 2023, Notification Letter, it added A.R. as a dependent, with effective payment date of August 1, 2023.

On December 18, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996 (Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR)). He sought an earlier effective date for the award of dependency compensation for A.R. The VA Regional Office denied an earlier effective date in a December 21, 2023, HLR Rating Decision. 

The Board received VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on February 2, 2024, from the Veteran. He elected the Direct Review docket. A February 12, 2024, Board letter informed the Veteran and his representative that his appeal had been formally placed on the Board's Direct Review docket. 

Evidentiary Standards

When a claimant chooses the HLR lane, the VA Regional Office is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the underlying rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(f). Here, the Veteran selected higher-level review of the December 6, 2023, decision. Thus, the VA Regional Office's December 21, 2023, HLR Rating Decision was limited to consideration of the evidence at the time of the December 6, 2023, decision. Likewise, the Board's review of the December 21, 2023, HLR Rating Decision is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the December 5, 2023, decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601(f), 20.301.

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal. VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The law requires the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant. Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128?29 (2000). The Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence within the period on appeal and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim.

Any findings favorable to the Veteran made by the VA Regional Office in notification of a decision are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). "Findings" means "conclusions on questions of fact and application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue under review." Id.

Effective Dates - Dependency Benefits

Any veteran who is entitled to disability compensation, and whose disability is rated not less than 30 percent, is entitled to additional compensation for dependents, including for a spouse and child. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(2).

"Unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim, of compensation, . . . shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1). Subsections of 5110 do provide for alternative effective dates for dependency compensation. 

"An award of additional compensation on account of dependents based on the establishment of a disability rating in the percentage evaluation specified by law for the purpose shall be payable from the effective date of such rating; but only if proof of dependents is received within one year from the date of notification of such rating action." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(f). 

Alternatively, "[t]he effective date of the award of any benefit or any increase therein by reason of marriage or the birth or adoption of a child shall be the date of such event if proof of such event is received by the Secretary within one year from the date of the marriage, birth, or adoption." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(n). VA's regulation fleshes out the statutory language of section 5110 in greater detail. 

Section 3.401(b) of Title 38, Chapter 1 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations provide that the effective date for additional compensation for a veteran's dependent(s) will be the latest of these dates: 

(1) Date of claim. This term means the following, listed in their order of applicability:

(i) Date of veteran's marriage, or birth of his or her child, or, adoption of a child, if the evidence of the event is received within 1 year of the event; otherwise.

(ii) Date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within 1 year of the Department of Veterans Affairs request.

(2) Date dependency arises.

(3) Effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within 1 year of notification of such rating action.

(4) Date of commencement of the veteran's award. 

38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b); see also Sharp v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 267, 276 (2009). The appellate courts have explained that entitlement to dependency compensation does not require submission of a separate claim; rather, a claimant need only submit updated information about his dependent to receive more compensation. Id. at 272.  

VA regulations specify what constitutes necessary "evidence" in this context. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.204 ("Evidence of dependents and age").  As it pertains to this Veteran's appeal, the relevant provision states that "VA will accept, for the purpose of determining entitlement to benefits under laws administered by VA, the statement of a claimant as proof of . . . birth of a child . . . provided that the statement contains: the date (month and year) and place of the event; [and] the full name and relationship of the other person to the claimant." 38 C.F.R. § 3.204(a)(1). "In addition, a claimant must provide the social security number of any dependent on whose behalf he or she is seeking benefits." Id. (citing 38 C.F.R. § 3.216). 

Regardless of the regulation governing effective dates of awards, payment of monetary benefits based on compensation begins the first day of the month following the effective date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

Analysis

The evidence establishes that the Veteran has had a combined disability rating of 30 percent from November 1, 2006. Thus, he was eligible to receive dependency benefits as of that date. But it was not until December 5, 2023, in connection with his July 2023 application for benefits, that he notified VA of the existence of his minor child, A.R. The Veteran did not notify VA within a year of A.R.'s birth in 2008. He notified VA within a year of the December4, 2023, Rating Decision, which granted compensation benefits effective July 26, 2023. Thus, the earliest legally available effective date was July 26, 2023. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b)(3). And the effective payment date assigned by the VA Regional Office, August 1, 2023, was correct. 38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

In his HLR request, the Veteran asserted that he was entitled to an effective date in 2008, the date of A.R.'s birth, because his Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) records documented her birth at that time. But DEERS is not a VA records system. VA does not have access to DEERS because it is a system used solely by the Department of Defense. The record does not indicate that the Veteran informed VA that he reported A.R.'s birth through DEERS prior to the issuance of the December 6, 2023, decision, such that VA was on notice of those records.

While the VA Regional Office has a duty to assist a claimant, 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2), the claimant bears ultimate responsibility for providing required information in support of claims for VA benefits. That duty includes identifying records that are not in VA's custody. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(3) ("The claimant must provide enough information to identify and locate the existing records including the custodian or agency holding the records; the approximate time frame covered by the records; . . . ."). The Veteran did not inform VA of the existence of his DEERS records prior to the December 6, 2023, decision; thus, VA had no duty to seek such records. Hence, there is no duty-to-assist violation requiring further development. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Accordingly, an effective date prior to August 1, 2023, for payment of dependency compensation for the Veteran's minor child, A.R., is denied.

The Board observes that "no equities, no matter how compelling, can create a right to payment of the United States Treasury which has not been provided for by Congress." See Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992), citing Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 426; 110 S. Ct. 2465; 110 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1990). The Board is bound by the law governing the assignment of effective dates in its determination in this case. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c).

In relation to the foregoing adjudicated claim on appeal, to the extent evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.
