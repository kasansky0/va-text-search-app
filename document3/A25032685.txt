ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disorder is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral cataracts with dry eye syndrome is remanded.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder, to include sinusitis, is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disorder is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had bilateral hearing loss at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a respiratory disorder at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively supports a finding that the Veteran's diagnosed bilateral cataracts with dry eye syndrome are age-related condition.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. The criteria for service connection for a respiratory disorder are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for bilateral cataracts with dry eye syndrome are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1978 to August 1994.   

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  The AMA automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 8, 2023, decision.  See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (September 2023).  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 8, 2023, decision.  See Rating Decision (January 2024).  

In the February 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (February 2024).  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 8, 2023, AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Regarding the claims of entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disorder and bilateral hearing loss, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder and a cervical spine disorder, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that the issues of entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis and headaches are not on appeal.  The September 2023 rating decision denied service connection for each of the issues on appeal, as well as issues of entitlement to service connection for headaches and allergic rhinitis.  See Rating Decision (September 2023).  Thereafter, the AOJ received a request for higher level review.  See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level review (September 2023).  A subsequent January 2024 rating decision adjudicated the issues listed above.  See Rating Decision (January 2024).  The rating decision also, however, determined that duty to assist errors existed regarding the issues of entitlement to service connection for headaches and for allergic rhinitis.  See Rating Decision (January 2024).  Those two issues were, therefore, not adjudicated in the rating decision; rather, it was noted that opinions were needed prior to readjudication.  See VA Form 20-0999 Higher-Level Review Return (January 2024).  The Veteran's Notice of Disagreement was received by the AOJ on February 6, 2024.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (February 2024).  Although the Veteran included the issues of service connection for headaches and allergic rhinitis, those issues are not subject to Board review at this time.   

Such review would constitute impermissible concurrent election of multiple review options.  See 38 C.F.R. §3.2500(a)-(f).  This is because at the time of the February 2024 Notice of Disagreement that elected Board review, these issues remained pending final adjudication in the higher-level review lane.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a), (b).  Thus, there is no valid appeal to the Board regarding entitlement to service connection for headaches and allergic rhinitis.  Accordingly, those issues are not considered herein.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show:  (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

In addition, service connection for certain chronic diseases, including hearing loss, may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271-72 (2015).  Although the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumptive period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).

Additionally, for certain chronic diseases with potential onset during service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1333 (1997).  The requirement of a current disability is satisfied when the claimant is shown to have the disability either at the time he or she files his claim for service connection, or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to final adjudication.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  When the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the filing of a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that must be addressed in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).  A formal diagnosis is not required to satisfy the current disability element for all service connection claims.  Rather, pain alone may constitute a current disability if it causes functional impairment of earning capacity.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran alleges that he has bilateral hearing loss that is due to service, to include working on an airfield without proper hearing protection.  He stated he has trouble hearing whispers and sometimes close conversations.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim at 13-14 (January 2023).   

The Board concludes that the evidence of record weighs against finding the Veteran has bilateral hearing loss, at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

For VA purposes, impaired hearing is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

There are no in-service complaints, symptoms, or diagnoses of hearing loss.  See STR - Medical (September 2024).  Rather, audiograms dated in 1983, 1986, 1988, 1992, and 1994 demonstrate normal hearing for VA purposes.  See STR-Medical at 55, 57, 60 (September 1994); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Notably, the service discharge audiogram demonstrates normal hearing for VA purposes.  See STR-Medical at 32-33 (September 1994).  Additionally, the post-service VA and private medical records also do not contain any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses of bilateral hearing loss.  See e.g., CAPRI (February 2023); CAPRI (July 2023); CAPRI (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (December 2015).  Furthermore, in a June 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) reflects no finding for hearing loss disability for VA purposes.  See C&P Exam at 2-3 (June 2023).  Thus, the objective evidence of record indicates that there is no hearing loss for VA purposes.

The Veteran has asserted entitlement to service connection for hearing loss, reporting difficulty hearing.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim at 13-14 (January 2023).  The Veteran is competent to report hearing loss symptoms.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005) (noting that a lay witness is competent to report to factual matters of which he or she has first-hand knowledge).  Lay witnesses may, in some circumstances, opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  But the diagnosis of a hearing loss for VA purposes is not susceptible to lay observation because it requires audiological testing by a state licensed audiologist for auditory thresholds at the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz and speech recognition scores the Maryland CNC Test.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Accordingly, the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disorder.

The Veteran asserts that he has a respiratory disorder due to exposures from working on the airfield and directly with jet fuel for years.  He stated that he has issues with breathing, inhaling, and exhaling, and that sometimes it feels as if he has asthma when he's doing the bare minimum or even exercise.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim at 13 (January 2023).   

The Board concludes that the evidence of record weighs against finding the Veteran has had a respiratory disability at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Board finds that there is not a current respiratory disability.  See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Here, the Veteran's STRs show no respiratory complaints, treatment, or diagnoses.  See e.g., STR-Medical (September 1994).  Notably, May 1994 Report of Examination (ROME) at service separation/retirement reflects normal clinical evaluation of the lung and chest.  See STR-Medical at 32 (September 1994). The May 1994 Report of Medical History ROMH) reflects that the Veteran denied a history of having or having had asthma, shortness of breath, chronic cough.

Post-service VA and private treatment records also do not show any respiratory disabilities, other than obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  See e.g., CAPRI (February 2024); CAPRI (July 2023); CAPRI (February 2023); Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (December 2015).  Additionally, a VA clinician determined there was no respiratory disability, noting the presence of normal pulmonary function testing, and the Veteran's denials of respiratory symptoms other than those related to OSA.  See C&P Exam at 2, 10 (April 2023).  The objective evidence of record does not show a respiratory disability.  

The Veteran reports he has a respiratory disability and symptoms.  He is competent to report his symptoms. However, he is not competent to diagnose a respiratory disability. Further to the extent that he reports symptoms of disability, the Board finds these reports less than credible as there are conflicting statements of record. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005) (noting that a lay witness is competent to report to factual matters of which he or she has first-hand knowledge); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995) (noting that the credibility of a witness may be impeached by a showing of interest, bias, inconsistent statements, consistency with other evidence), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  In VA and private medical records, the Veteran denied shortness of breath or dyspnea and there was not wheezing.  See e.g., CAPRI at 50, 129 (February 2024); CAPRI at 51, 80, 158 (February 2023); Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility at 52 (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 25, 55, 107 (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 80, 89 (December 2015).  These conflicting reports lessen the probative value of the Veteran's assertions of respiratory symptoms and disability. 

Additionally, VA and private treatment records do not contain reports of respiratory symptoms.  See e.g., CAPRI (February 2024); CAPRI (February 2023); Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (December 2015).  Silence in a medical record can be weighed against lay testimony if the alleged injury, disease, or related symptoms would ordinarily have been recorded in the medical record.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 440 (2011) (Lance, J., concurring).  Here, the Veteran reported sinus symptoms, sleep apnea, and back, knee, and foot pain, in VA and private treatment records during the relevant time period.  See CAPRI (February 2023); CAPRI (July 2023); CAPRI (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (February 2024).  Where there is a lack of notation of medical condition or symptoms where such notation would normally be expected, the Board may consider this as evidence that the condition or symptoms did not exist.  Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011).  In these records, although the Veteran reported other orthopedic and sinus symptoms, he did not report respiratory symptoms; the Board finds that chronic, recurrent, or persistent symptoms of a respiratory disorder would have been reported in the VA and private treatment records where other conditions were reported.  This, in conjunction with the conflicting statements, tends to weigh against the presence of a respiratory disability. Given the foregoing, his statements of respiratory disability are not persuasive.

Moreover, neither the lay nor the medical evidence indicates that the Veteran has respiratory symptoms, even if undiagnosed, that causes functional impairment of earning capacity.  Therefore, a current respiratory disability is not shown. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1333 (1997).  

Accordingly, the claim is denied.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

3.  Entitlement to service connection for bilateral cataracts with dry eye syndrome.

The Veteran asserts that he has vision problems due to his headaches.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim at 14 (January 2023).  It is noted that service connection for headaches has not been established.

Also, the Veteran also asserts vaguely that bilateral cataracts with dry eye syndrome due to his Persian Gulf War exposures/ toxins.  See Correspondence (September 2023).  It is noted that the Veteran is not a Persian Gulf War veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e). However, VA has conceded that the Veteran participated in toxic exposure risk activities (TERAs) that are based on the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) - exposure to jet fuel, diesel,    JP-8, and industrial solvents due to his MOS as a petroleum supply specialist and aviation operations specialist.  See other (March 2023).  

The Board concludes that the criteria for service connection for bilateral cataracts with dry eye syndrome are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

First, the Board finds that there is a current disability.  See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  An April 2023 VA-obtained VA Eye Conditions examination report noted diagnoses of dry eye syndrome and cataracts.  See C&P Exam at 2 (April 2023).  Therefore, the first element of service connection is met.

Second, the Board finds that there was an in-service event, injury or disease.  See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  In this regard, as noted above, VA has conceded TERAs that are based on the Veteran's MOS - exposure to jet fuel, diesel, JP-8, and industrial solvents due to his MOS as a petroleum supply specialist and aviation operations specialist.  See other (March 2023).  Therefore, the second element of service connection is met.  

Third, however, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not support a finding that the current eye disorders began in service or are related to the conceded in-service exposures during his active service.  See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

The Veteran's STRs reflect no complaints or finding for injury to the eyes, or abnormal pathology of the eyes or vision. A November 1988 Report of Medical Examination (ROME) reflects normal clinical evaluation of the eyes and vision; and the associated Report of Medical History (ROMH) reflects that the Veteran denied a history of having or having had "eye trouble." A May 1994 ROME at retirement/separation reflects normal clinical evaluation of the eyes and vision; the associated May 1994 ROMH reflects that the Veteran reported a history of having of having had "eye trouble," but no further explanation was given. 

VA received in September 1994 the Veteran's original VA compensation claim. But it did not include any report of eye injury or vision/eye disability. See VA Form 21-526EZ (September1994). Likewise, in February 2004 and September 2017, VA received a claims for disability benefits, but those applications did not include any report of eye injury or vision/eye disability. See VA Forms 21-526EZ (February 2004) & (September 2017).

Non-VA treatment records, provided by the Veteran, show no eye or vision abnormalities except for a notation of conjunctivitis in October 2018. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (MTR) (December 2015.) (October 2011 note shows "Eyes: Pupils equal, reactive to light. Normal conjunctivae. Vision unchanged); Correspondence (April 2023) (notation for conjunctivitis in October 2018). Similarly, VA treatment records dated between 2017 and 2022 reflect no vision or eye complaints, or abnormal pathology. See CAPRI (February 2023). 

Post service, vision/eye problems are first documented on the Veteran's January 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ claim application-roughly 19 years after service discharge . See VA Form 21-526EZ (January 2023) (reporting blurred vision associated with his claim service connection for headaches). The Veteran did not provide nor identify any relevant non-VA treatment records supporting his claim. An April 2023 VA-obtained Eye Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) reflects diagnoses for bilateral cataract with dry eye syndrome. By history, "The veteran was a petroleum specialist in the army and reports fuel would splash into his eyes at times when working. The veteran reports eyes would swell and would have soreness and redness when this would occur." See C&P Exam at 1 (April 2023). The Veteran provided no history as to any treatment or diagnoses or any persistent, recurrent symptoms in and since service. The associated medical opinion attributed the Veteran's bilateral cataract with dry eye syndrome to his age-the Veteran was roughly age 64 at the time of this examination and opinion. 

The Board finds that there is not competent, credible evidence of onset of any current eye disorder in service. While the Veteran is competent to report injury, such fuel splashing into eyes, and symptoms itching/swelling, he is not competent to diagnose himself as having had cataracts with dry eye syndrome in service as this is not susceptible to lay observation. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d. 1372 (2007). Further, the Veteran does not specifically report any in-service onset of disability; rather he alleges injury and symptoms in service.

Next, the Board finds that there is not competent, credible evidence that the Veteran's diagnosed eye conditions are due to or the result of his in-service jet fuel exposures, to include his alleged injury of fuel splashing into eyes. The Veteran is not competent to link his cataracts with dry eye syndrome, diagnosed roughly 19 years after service separation to an in-service injury, as this is not susceptible to lay observation, and requires medical knowledge and training as to diseases of the eye and their causes, which the Veteran is not shown to possess.  See Jandreau, supra. Therefore, the Veteran's medical opinion has no probative value. 

Consequently, the Board assigns greater probative value to April 2023 medical opinion, which considered the Veteran's history and statements, to include his conceded in-service exposures. The opinion reflects that his cataracts with dry eye syndrome are age related diseases and, thus, less likely than not caused by the in-service exposures, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs.

The Board finds that the rational is sufficient to support the conclusion reached. Here, the rationale is clear and based on in-person examination of the Veteran as well as review of his claims file, to include specifically the Veteran's report that "fuel would splash into his eyes at times when working" and that he then had eye swelling, soreness, and redness; it reflects consideration of the Veteran's conceded TERAs to include the combined synergistic effect; and the opinion was provided by a medical professional in the field of optometry who is skilled, trained, and knowledgeable in diagnosing and treating eye conditions. A roadmap connecting the supporting facts to the conclusion is not required and it essential rationale for the negative opinion is clear in that the conditions are age related disorder. See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012) (the fact that the rationale provided by an examiner "did not explicitly lay out the examiner's journey from the facts to a conclusion," did not render the examination inadequate); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record). 

The Veteran has not provided nor identified any medical evidence supporting that his diagnosed conditions are due to an etiology other than his age. Further, where there is a clear etiology, as here, no TERA examination and opinion is required. 38 U.S.C. § 1168. As such, in this case, the in-service exposures becomes immaterial when another clear etiology presents itself. 

As explained above, the Board finds the medical opinion is more persuasive that the Veteran's uncorroborated medical opinion. 

As to the Veteran's theory that his eye disorders are secondary to headaches, the Board finds that service connection on a secondary basis is not warranted as the Veteran has not established entitlement to service connection for headaches-indeed service connection for headaches was recently denied by the AOJ in a July 2024 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

Accordingly, the claim is denied.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

In remanding these matters, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions.  Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder, to include sinusitis.

The Veteran asserts that he has a sinus disorder that is due to his service in Korea where he was exposed to various toxins working on the airfield and with military vehicles.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim at 13 (January 2023).  VA has conceded TERAs that are based on the Veteran's MOS - exposure to jet fuel, diesel, JP-8, and industrial solvents due to his MOS as a petroleum supply specialist and aviation operations specialist.  See other (March 2023).  

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a sinus disorder is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.

VA's duty to assist claimants in the development of their claims includes obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Further, once an examination or opinion is obtained, VA must ensure that it is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate). 

An April 2023 VA-obtained Sinusitis/Rhinitis and Other Conditions of the Nose, Throat, Larynx and Pharynx Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) reflects a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis but not a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis.  See C&P Exam at 1 (April 2023).  The Veteran reported allergy symptoms, change in sense of smell, frequent sinus infections without imaging to confirm chronic sinusitis.  See C&P Exam at 2 (April 2023).  The clinician opined that the claimed condition is less likely as not caused by the in-service exposures from the Veteran's participation in TERAs, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs.  See C&P Exam at 3 (April 2023).  The clinician reasoned that the Veteran was found not to have evidence of exposure over permissible limits in the ILER report.  See C&P Exam at 3 (April 2023).  

The Board finds that the opinion is inadequate for adjudicative purposes.

First, although it appears that the clinician determined there was no sinus disorder, the clinician did not address all relevant evidence of record in coming to that conclusion.  See C&P Exam at 1-2 (April 2023).  Here, there are notations of sinus infections intermittently in the years 2022 and 2023.  See CAPRI at 80, 81 (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 22, 26, 105 (February 2024); CAPRI at 23 (July 2023); Medical Treatment Record Non-Government Facility (April 2023).  The clinician noted the existence of these records but did not address the records in the determination that there was no current sinus disability.  This casts doubt on the opinion's rationale. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008). 

Second, the rationale is also unclear.  Although a roadmap connecting the supporting facts to the conclusion is not required, the "essential rationale for the opinion must be discernable from a review of the report as a whole."  Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012).  The clinician did not address why a nexus cannot be present where there is a finding that exposures were not over permissible limits in the ILER report.  A "medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.".  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008). 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

2.  Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disorder. 

The Veteran contends that his cervical spine disorder was caused by lifting fuel hoses exceeding over 100 pounds and working on an airfield.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (January 2023).  The Veteran's MOS was a petroleum supply specialist and aviation operations specialist.  See other (March 2023).  

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disorder is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  

Again, where VA provides the veteran with an examination in a service connection claim, the examination must be adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). 

Here, a March 2023 VA-obtained Neck Conditions DBQ reflects a diagnosis of degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome.  See C&P Exam at 2 (March 2023).  By history, the Veteran injured his shoulder and neck area when playing a sport and that he has had neck stiffness with shooting pain.  See C&P Exam at 2 (March 2023).  The clinician opined that the cervical spine disorder was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  See C&P Exam at 1 (March 2023).  The rationale was that:

On review of str the veteran September 24, 1980  for neck pain however the provider diagnosed a bilateral upper trapezius strain which is not the neck. No neck diagnosis was noted during service.

This opinion is inadequate because it dismisses the trapezius strain vis-à-vis any current neck disability without explanation, particularly considering that the trapezius muscles are generally considered muscles on the upper back that help with motion of the neck in addition to the upper back. Further, the opinion appears to improperly require a "neck diagnosis" during service in order for there to be a link between the current disability and an in-service injury. However, service connection may be established for any disease diagnosed after service discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

There is competent evidence of a September 1980 bilateral upper trapezius muscle strain with complaints of bilateral neck (cervical) pain since "spearing an opponent" in football match-the clinician noting that the Veteran was "well known to us for multiple football injuries" and this was a new complaint of bilateral cervical pain. However, the medical opinion does not give any meaningful consideration to this evidence, injury and abnormal pathology,  in formulating the negative opinion. 

Lastly, the medical opinion does not reflect consideration of the Veteran's report that his years of military duty as a petroleum supply specialist and aviation operations specialist, which include lifting fuel hoses exceeding over 100 pounds and working on an airfield, injured his neck and that this injury caused his current disability. Generally, a "VA examiner's failure to consider [a veteran's] testimony when formulating her opinion renders that opinion inadequate." See McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15, 30-31 (2016). Further, a VA examination and/or opinion is required when there is an indication in the record that a current disability is related to military service; the threshold for an indication is low. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). Given that in this case there is evidence of a current disability, in-service documented complaints and findings for trapezius strain, the Board finds that VA had a duty to obtain a medical opinion that considered the Veteran's theory of causation even though it is essentially retrospective speculation that there was in-service injury from performing his duties. The Board notes that the STRs do not document any injury from these duties, but the Veteran is competent to report having performed these duties and the duties appear to be consistent with the nature of his service. 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Obtain an addendum opinion regarding the Veteran's claimed sinus disorder.  The entire claims file, to include a copy of this REMAND, should be made available to and reviewed by the clinician.  The phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal.

The clinician should opine as to:

a)	Whether there is a current sinus disability, including recurrent sinus infections.  Explain.  Address the notations of persistent sinus infections, chronic rhinosinusitis, and sinusitis requiring antibiotics once per year, in the record, to include in VA and private medical records dated in 2022 and 2023.  

b)	Whether any diagnosed sinus disorder (e.g. sinusitis, rhinitis) is at least as likely as not due to, or the result of, the Veteran's in-service chemical exposures including jet fuel, diesel fuel, JP-8, and industrial solvents.  Explain.

When providing this opinion, the examiner must consider: 

1) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and 

2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

2.  Obtain an addendum opinion regarding the Veteran's cervical spine disability.  The entire claims file, to include a copy of this REMAND, should be made available to and reviewed by the clinician.  The phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal.

The clinician should address: 

Whether the Veteran's cervical spine disability at least as likely as not is due to or the result of his lifting fuel hoses exceeding over 100 pounds and working on an airfield for years as a petroleum supply specialist and aviation operations specialist.  Explain.

Whether the Veteran's cervical spine disability at least as likely as not is due to or the result of his trapezius muscle injury in 1980 with neck pain complaints.  Explain.
