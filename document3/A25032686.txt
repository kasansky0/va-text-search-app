Entitlement to service connection for right ear sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left ear hearing loss during the review period (from June 8, 2022, through October 12, 2023) is remanded.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis during the review period (from June 8, 2022, through October 12, 2023) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's left knee manifestations began during and have continued since service (being diagnosed post-service as arthritis) and were at least as likely as not caused by in-service injury.

2. The probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's right shoulder manifestations began during and have continued since service (being diagnosed post-service as arthritis) and were at least as likely as not caused by in-service injury.

3. The probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's right ear SNHL was at least as likely as not caused by exposure to in-service hazardous noise.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis have been met.  38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right shoulder osteoarthritis have been met.  38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1982 to August 1991.  The Board thanks the Veteran for his service to our country. 

On June 8, 2022, VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ initiating the claims herein.  In a September 22, 2022, Rating Decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), in pertinent part, denied entitlement to service connection for CFS and entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  In an October 4, 2022, Rating Decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, denied entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition, denied entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder condition, and granted service connection for allergic rhinitis (assigning a noncompensable rating effective June 8, 2022).  On May 2, 2023, VA received a VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim Application) regarding the claims herein.  In an October 12, 2023, Rating Decision (on appeal), the AOJ, in pertinent part, denied the claims herein.  On November 21, 2023, VA received a VA Form 10182 electing the Board's review of the claims herein under its Direct Review Docket pursuant to the modernized review system under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  38?C.F.R. §?20.301.

Applicable Review Periods and Evidentiary Windows

The review period and the evidentiary window are distinct concepts in AMA that are not interchangeable (the review period is limited to the period considered by the AOJ [i.e., ends at the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal]; the evidentiary window is the time which evidence may be submitted and considered for the issue on appeal).  The Direct Review Docket only permits the Board to review the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision(s) on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the VA Form 10182; in this case, the Veteran has not filed such a request. ?Id; 38 C.F.R. § 20.301; Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).  

Regarding the appeal herein, the review periods span from the date of the claims (June 8, 2022) through the date the AOJ issued the decision on appeal (October 12, 2023); the evidentiary windows are limited to evidence associated with the claims file on or before the date the AOJ issued the decision on appeal (October 12, 2023).  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. §?3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  Cook, supra.  However, regarding the claims remanded herein, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Under the AMA, the reasons for remand are limited to: (a) correction of pre-decisional, duty-to-assist errors; and (b) correction of an AOJ error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).? Following correction of the error, the AOJ must readjudicate the issue.? Pub. L. No. 115-55, § 2(d)(2); 38?C.F.R. §?3.2502.? A claimant may choose to file a new appeal to the Board from such readjudication or request higher-level review or a supplemental claim with the AOJ.

1. Entitlement to service connection for left knee degenerative arthritis

2. Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder osteoarthritis

Direct service connection may be warranted if the evidence shows: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Although a competent medical opinion is generally required to establish etiology, competent and credible lay evidence of chronicity and continuity of symptomology may also establish etiology.  38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b); Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465?(1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372?(Fed. Cir. 2007).  Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d); Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043?(Fed. Cir. 1994). 

When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a Veteran's disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki,?24?Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau,?supra.  In this case, the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran has the medical background necessary to opine regarding symptoms or diagnoses that are not lay observable; however, as a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report lay-observable symptoms and functional loss because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses.  Layno,?supra.  Lay evidence may establish a diagnosis of a simple medical condition, a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or symptoms that later support a diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau, supra.

The Veteran generally contends that his left knee and right shoulder manifestations (diagnosed post-separation as arthritis) began during and have continued since service and are etiologically related to in-service injury.  See June 8, 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ; May 2, 2023, Correspondence; May 2, 2023, Buddy Statement by CC (the Veteran's spouse).  Service treatment records did not document pertinent abnormalities upon entrance to service (see October 6, 1981, enlistment examination); however, they documented ongoing treatment for in-service trauma to the left knee and right shoulder while playing football (see August 9, 1985, September 3, 1985, and March 3, 1987, records).  

Crucially, the Veteran has competently, credibly, and consistently contended that his lay-observable manifestations began during and have continued since service; as such, the Board finds the Veteran's reports of in-service injury and continuity of symptomology since service to be probative.  Layno,?supra;?Jandreau,?supra.  The AOJ afforded the Veteran pertinent VA examinations in August 2022 (with etiological opinions in September 2022) from which the examiners rendered unfavorable etiological conclusions (finding a lack of chronic manifestations since service); however, the Board finds those opinions to be inadequate because they did not sufficiently consider the Veteran's probative reports of ongoing, lay-observable manifestations since in-service onset.  Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (an examination must consider lay evidence of in-service incurrence or continuity of symptomatology since service); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (VA has a duty to provide a thorough medical examination, one which accounts for the Veteran's prior medical history and describes the disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability is fully informed).  Nevertheless, the Board finds that remand for further medical development is not warranted because, as discussed above, there is no indication that the Veteran had pertinent problems prior to service, injury during service has been conceded, and the Veteran provided probative reports of lay-observable manifestations since service that were corroborated by his spouse (a certified medical assistant) and subsequently attributed to the arthritis diagnoses herein by medical providers.  See August 2022 VA knee examination (the examiner diagnosed left knee degenerative arthritis other than post-traumatic); May 2023 Buddy Statement by CC; September 2023 VA shoulder examination (the examiner diagnosed bilateral shoulder strain and acromioclavicular (AC) joint osteoarthritis); Jandreau, supra; Layno, supra.  Accordingly, the probative lay statements regarding continuity of symptomatology since service, coupled with post-separation providers attributing that continuing symptomatology to the arthritis diagnoses herein, are sufficient to establish nexuses between the in-service injury and the claimed disabilities.  Thus, the Board grants the left knee and right shoulder claims on direct bases, resolving them in full.

3. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss

Direct service connection may be warranted if the evidence shows: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden, supra.  Although a competent medical opinion is generally required to establish etiology, competent and credible lay evidence of chronicity and continuity of symptomology may also establish etiology.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Layno, supra; Jandreau, supra.  Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d); Combee, supra.

When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a Veteran's disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana,?supra; Jandreau,?supra.  In this case, the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran has the medical background necessary to opine regarding symptoms or diagnoses that are not lay observable; however, as a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report lay-observable symptoms and functional loss because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses.  Layno,?supra.  Lay evidence may establish a diagnosis of a simple medical condition, a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or symptoms that later support a diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau, supra.

The Veteran is already service connected for left ear hearing loss; he generally contends that his right ear SNHL similarly began during and has continued since service as a result of exposure to significant hazardous noise.  See June 8, 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ.  The AOJ has already conceded that the Veteran has a current disability for VA purposes and that he experienced hazardous noise exposure during service (see October 2023 Rating Decision); the Board finds no reason to disturb those favorable findings.  Service treatment records did not document pertinent abnormalities upon entrance to service (see October 6, 1981, enlistment examination); however, they documented a significant threshold shift for the left ear only, with the right ear hearing levels within normal limits upon separation (see January 16, 1985, and May 23, 1986, hearing conservation data).  The AOJ afforded the Veteran pertinent VA examinations in July 2022 and October 2023 (with an etiological opinion in October 2023) in which the examiners rendered unfavorable etiological conclusions (finding the lack of a threshold shift in the right ear during service to be dispositive). 

Based on the above, the probative evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's right ear SNHL was at least as likely as not caused by exposure to in-service hazardous noise.  Specifically, the Veteran has competently, credibly, and consistently described how he has experienced continuous, lay-observable decreased hearing since its in-service onset; as such, the Board finds his reports to be probative.  Contrarily, the VA opinions discussed above are inadequate because the rationale was based on the Veteran not having hearing loss for VA purposes at the time of separation, which does not adequately consider the Veteran's probative reports of lay-observable manifestations since service; as such, the Board finds those opinions to lack probative value.  Dalton, supra; Barr, supra.  Nevertheless, the Board finds that remand for further medical development is not warranted because, as discussed above, there is no indication that the Veteran's audiological problems clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service, hazardous noise exposure during service has been conceded, the Veteran is competent to self-diagnose decreased hearing ability and its onset because it is lay-observable through his senses, and the Veteran provided probative reports of lay-observable manifestations since service that were subsequently attributed to the right ear SNHL diagnosis (even though the measured puretone thresholds did not rise to hearing loss for VA purposes, as legally defined, until after separation).  Jandreau, supra; Layno, supra.  Accordingly, the Veteran's probative statements regarding continuity of symptomatology since service, coupled with post-separation providers attributing that continuing symptomatology to the right ear SNHL diagnosis, are sufficient to establish a nexus between the in-service injury and the audiological disability.  Thus, the Board grants the claim on a direct basis, resolving it in full.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left ear hearing loss during the review period (from June 8, 2022, through October 12, 2023)

As discussed above, this Board Decision has granted entitlement to service connection for right ear SNHL; upon the AOJ's implementation of this Board Decision, the Veteran will be service connected for bilateral hearing loss (instead of just left ear hearing loss) throughout the review period.  Now that service connection has been granted for right ear SNHL, the Veteran's left and right ear hearing loss should be evaluated together from the effective date of the award of service connection for right ear SNHL.  38?C.F.R. §?4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.  However, the Board cannot assign an initial?rating?or?effective date?in the?first instance; rather, the AOJ must first implement the award of service connection for right ear SNHL and assign the appropriate?rating?and?effective date.  Grantham v. Brown,?114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59?(Fed. Cir. 1997); Sprinkle v. Shinseki,?733 F.3d 1180, 118384 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (noting that claims in VA benefits cases are initially developed and adjudicated by the RO and reviewed on appeal by the Board to ensure that claimants receive the benefit of this two-tiered review within the agency).  Thus, because the initial?rating?and?effective date?assigned following the award of service connection for right ear SNHL may impact the Veteran's entitlement to a higher?rating?for bilateral hearing loss, the claim is remanded for contemporaneous adjudication.  Harris v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?180, 183?(1991) (holding that two issues are inextricably intertwined when they are so closely tied together that a final decision on one issue cannot be rendered until a decision on the other issues has been rendered). 

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis during the review period (from June 8, 2022, through October 12, 2023)

3. Entitlement to an initial increased rating above 10 percent for CFS during the review period (from June 8, 2022, through October 12, 2023)

When VA undertakes to provide an examination or obtain an opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  The Veteran generally contends that the severity of his allergic rhinitis and CFS manifestations during the review period warrant higher ratings.  See June 8, 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ; August 8, 2022, Buddy Statement by CC (the Veteran's spouse); May 2, 2023, Correspondence; May 2, 2023, Buddy Statement by CC (the Veteran's spouse).  

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is currently rated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6522 at zero percent since June 8, 2022.  See October 2023 Codesheet; 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522.  Under DC 6522 (for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis): a 30 percent (maximum schedular) rating is warranted with polyps; and a 10 percent rating is warranted without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522.  

The Veteran's CFS is currently rated under DC 8863-6354 at 10 percent since June 8, 2022.  See October 2023 Codesheet; 38 C.F.R. § 4.88b, DC 6354.  Under DC 6354 (for CFS), compensable ratings are warranted for debilitating fatigue, cognitive impairments (such as inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, or confusion), or a combination of other signs and symptoms: which are nearly constant and so severe as to restrict routine daily activities almost completely and which may occasionally preclude self-care (warranting a 100 percent rating); which are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities to less than 50 percent of the pre-illness level or which wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least six weeks total duration per year (warranting a 60 percent rating); which are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities from 50 to 75 percent of the pre-illness level or which wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least four but less than six weeks total duration per year (warranting a 40 percent rating); which are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities by less than 25 percent of the pre-illness level or which wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least two but less than four weeks total duration per year (warranting a 20 percent rating); and which wax and wane but result in periods of incapacitation of at least one but less than two weeks total duration per year or symptoms controlled by continuous medication (warranting a 10 percent rating).  38 C.F.R. § 4.88b, DC 6354.  The Note under DC 6354 states: for the purpose of evaluating this disability, incapacitation exists only when a licensed physician prescribes bed rest and treatment.  Id.

The AOJ afforded the Veteran pertinent VA rhinitis and CFS examinations in August 2022 and September 2023.  Regarding the rhinitis disability, the examiners, in pertinent part, indicated that there were no polyps and there was not greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side; however, the examiners did not address the Veteran's contentions that he had a higher level of obstruction of his nasal passage.  Barr, supra.  Specifically, in a May 2, 2023, Correspondence, the Veteran contended that his March 6, 2008, obstructive sleep apnea post-operative report lists preoperative diagnoses including a deviated septum and turbinate (which the Veteran equates to severe nasal blockage preventing airflow and breathing).  Regarding the CFS disability, the examiners, in pertinent part, indicated that the Veteran's symptoms waxed and waned; however, the examiners did not address the Veteran's contentions that his symptoms had remained continuous (constant or nearly constant).  Barr, supra.  Specifically, in a May 2, 2023, Correspondence, the Veteran reported that he felt fatigued continuously and that it had increased in severity over time; in the August 8, 2022, and May 2, 2023, Buddy Statements, CC (the Veteran's spouse) similarly wrote that the Veteran had "constant" fatigue and "always" reported being fatigued.

Based on the medical inconsistencies discussed above, the Board finds that the AOJ committed pre-decisional, duty-to-assist errors in failing to obtain adequate VA examination findings; specifically, as discussed above, the AOJ relied on inadequate VA examination findings insofar as they did not address evidence that potentially supports higher ratings.  Although the Board has carefully considered whether remand could be avoided, the AOJ committed pre-decisional, duty-to-assist errors and the evidence of record during the evidentiary window is insufficient to decide the claims; as such, remand is required for further medical development.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. After implementing the award of service connection for right ear SNHL and assigning the appropriate?rating?and?effective date, evaluate the Veteran's left and right ear hearing loss together (as bilateral hearing loss). 

2. Regarding the allergic rhinitis disability, obtain an opinion regarding whether, during the review period, it manifested in greater than 50-percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.

The examiner must consider, but is not limited to, the Veteran's contentions that he had a higher level of obstruction of his nasal passage than documented by VA examiners.  See May 2, 2023, Correspondence (the Veteran contended that his March 6, 2008, obstructive sleep apnea post-operative report lists preoperative diagnoses including a deviated septum and turbinate, which the Veteran equates to severe nasal blockage preventing airflow and breathing).

The Board defers to the examiner's discretion to determine whether in-person examination is required to render the requested information. 

3. Regarding the CFS disability, obtain an opinion regarding whether, during the review period, it manifested in nearly-constant symptoms and, if so, then determine what percent of routine daily activities are restricted compared to the pre-illness level.

The examiner must consider, but is not limited to, the Veteran's contentions that his symptoms remained continuous (constant or nearly constant).  See May 2, 2023, Correspondence (the Veteran reported that he felt fatigued continuously and that it had increased in severity over time); see also August 8, 2022, and May 2, 2023, Buddy Statements (the Veteran's spouse similarly wrote that the Veteran had "constant" fatigue and "always" reported being fatigued).

The Board defers to the examiner's discretion to determine whether in-person examination is required to render the requested information.
