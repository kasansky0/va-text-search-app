ORDER

The appeal seeking payment of Chapter 35 Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits for the month of August 2022 is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Appellant received Chapter 35 payment from VA for the school term from August 22, 2022, to September 30, 2022, rendering his appeal regarding the issue of non-payment for August 2022 to be moot.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There being no question of fact or law to be decided by the Board, the appeal for payment of Chapter 35 DEA benefits, for the month of August 2022, is dismissed as moot, as the benefit has been granted. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1988 to March 1992. The Appellant is the Veteran's adult son.

In the September 6, 2022, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.

The Board notes that the Appellant listed a September 2, 2022, decision date as the decision on appeal. The Board is unable to locate in the education file a decision bearing this date; however, given the Appellant's assertions, it is clear that the issue stated on the appeal relates to Chapter 35 educational benefit payments for the school term beginning in August 2022. The Appellant had previously been issued a letter advising of an overpayment and corresponding debt on July 15, 2022, which letter was returned as undeliverable. It appears his August 2022 payment was withheld, in part, for recoupment of the debt. Thus, given the undeliverable July 2022 letter, the Board may presume the Appellant first became aware of the debt and any consequentially withheld August 2022 payment on the date noted on the VA Form 10182.

In February 2025, the Board notified the Appellant that he had submitted additional documents and/or statements with his VA Form 10182, and that because he had selected the Direct Review docket, any new additional evidence submitted could not be considered by the Board. He was advised that if he wanted any additional evidence considered, he needed to switch AMA dockets to Evidence Submission or Hearing and was provided further explanation for how to do so. The Appellant did not respond. Regardless, the Board notes that the Veteran did not actually submit any documents; rather he merely included argument on the VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board will proceed with adjudication on the Direct Review docket. See Edwards v. McDonough, 36?Vet. App.?56 (2023).

Given the Appellant's election of the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Payment of Chapter 35 DEA benefits for the month of August 2022

In his appeal, the Appellant asserted he did not receive Chapter 35 DEA payment from VA for the month of August 2022. 

Basic eligibility for DEA Chapter 35 benefits is established in one of several ways, including being the child of a veteran who has a total and permanent disability rating from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021. 

DEA benefits include money for tuition, money for housing, money for books and supplies. The amount VA pays for DEA benefits is based on the type of training program. It is also based on whether the individual receiving DEA benefits attends training part-time of full-time. Benefits are paid monthly and in arrears, or at the end of the course of study. If attendance is less than a month or less than full-time, payments will be reduced.

Here, the Appellant is the Veteran's child, and in a rating decision dated January 2022, the Veteran was granted permanent and total disability status and basic eligibility to DEA was established from May 2021.   

The Appellant applied for DEA benefits in March 2022 and a Certificate of Eligibility was issued the same month, with an effective date to January 2022.

An April 2022 education award reflects the Appellant was awarded Chapter 35 educational allowance for the period of January 10, 2022, through May 12, 2022.

In April 2022, the Appellant set up direct deposit so that his Chapter 35 education payments would go directly to his bank account at his financial institution.

A June 2022 Chapter 35 education award reflects that the Appellant was awarded educational allowance at a monthly rate of $402.71, effective May 31, 2022, through June 5, 2022, and also awarded a monthly rate of $1298 per month effective June 14, 2022, through August 8, 2022, reflecting enrollment in summer courses. 

A letter issued to Appellant the same month advised, "the first check or direct deposit payment provides for payment through 6-30-22." The Board will presume, as there is no evidence to the contrary, that the Appellant thus received a payment via direct deposit covering the time period through June 30, 2022, as was stated in the letter.

Subsequently, a July 7, 2022, Chapter 35 education award was initiated, containing a "stop" enrollment code, with an effective date May 31, 2022. This reflects a finding that the Appellant's enrollment for the term ended on May 31, 2022, i.e., he opted not to enroll in summer courses.

Next, a July 15, 2022, letter was issued, advising the Appellant that his educational assistance allowance had been discontinued, effective May 31, 2022, due to having terminated his attendance as of May 30, 2022. The letter also stated he had been overpaid for summer enrollment despite not being enrolled in summer courses, noting that he had last been paid on June 30, 2022. The letter explained that this enrollment change resulted in an overpayment of $802.66. The Appellant was advised the debt must be repaid, and that the Debt Management Center (DMC) would follow up with more information. However, this letter was returned to VA on July 20, 2022, as undeliverable. Thus, it appears the Appellant may not have received the notice.

A July 27, 2022, record reflects the direct deposit payment for the Appellant was stopped. 

An August 2022 Enrollment Certification noted enrollment in educational courses beginning August 22, 2022, through December 15, 2022. It also updated the record with the Appellant's new and correct address.

An August 2022 Chapter 35 education award reflects an approved award for the term August 22, 2022, to December 16, 2022, with a rate of $1298 per month. The award noted the Appellant had an account receivable entry for repayment. An internal letters portal screenshot indicates the Appellant was notified on August 23, 2022. The Board reiterates that payment for a partial month, i.e., August 2022 in this case, would have been reduced proportionally considering the dates of enrollment. Additionally, the Board observes that if the Veteran had a debt of $802.66-which he has not disputed in this appeal-then the payment for August 2022, which was already reduced due to the course of study being less than a full month, may have been withheld entirely due to the debt recoupment. 

The VA Form 10182 was submitted on September 6, 2022, with the Appellant stating he had not received his Chapter 35 payment for the month of August 2022. The Board notes that the Appellant had subsequent correspondence with the RO, but as it post-dates the referenced decision and the date of the 10182, the Board may not consider it. 

While the underlying appeal was pending, on October 12, 2022, the RO issued a decision and notification letter. The Board notes that it may consider this decision as it is a legal determination and thus is not "evidence" under the AMA. 

In the decision, the RO advised the Appellant that his request for a review of the debt had been received, that he had previously been mistakenly paid for the dates of May 31, 2022 to June 5, 2022, and June 14, 2022, to June 30, 2022 (when he was not actually enrolled in summer courses), and that this overpayment created a debt in the amount of $802.66. The RO further noted in the decision that on October 4, 2022, the Appellant was paid $875.28, which was for August 22, 2022, to September 30, 2022, after the outstanding debt was recouped. Thus, the Appellant received some payment for August 2022, the month at issue in this appeal. The letter concluded, "Based on the timing of when your inquiry was submitted and then worked, you have since received the aforementioned payment." In short, the RO indicated the Appellant's complaint had been favorably resolved. The case file does not reflect any further decisions or appeals related to this issue.

Thus, the record before the Board reflects the Appellant has been granted the benefit sought - namely, payment for the term beginning in August 2022. While the Appellant may have had a net zero balance due to him for August 2022 in light of the outstanding debt, the evidence reflects the RO performed the relevant calculations and that payment was properly credited for the month of August 2022. Nothing in the underlying record before the Board reflects that the Appellant denied having been overpaid or otherwise disputed the previous debt for the summer of 2022 which led to the recoupment and associated delay in payments which covered the time period including August 2022. Nor did he contend that he was indeed enrolled in summer courses and properly received the payment that the RO found he erroneously received in June 2022. The debt is not the issue here. Rather, the Appellant's VA Form 10182 merely stated that he "did not receive money" for August 2022 "due to [an] error in summer enrollment courses." The "error" mentioned, and demonstrated by the evidence, is that he was paid for a summer enrollment that did not occur. Subsequent to the Board's receipt of this VA Form 10182, the RO corrected the error, accounted for the debt, and provided the Appellant the difference in the monies due to him, which included his verified enrollment for a portion of the month of August 2022.

As the Appellant has not appealed the existence, validity, or the amount of the debt, only stating that he did not get paid for August 2022 (which he later did), the Board need not address any issues regarding the debt itself. If the Appellant believes the amount of the debt was incorrect, or otherwise wishes to dispute it, he may contact the DMC accordingly.

In summary, while his appeal was pending, the Appellant received Chapter 35 VA educational assistance benefits for the portion of the month of August 2022 that he was enrolled in educational courses, the subject of the current appeal. That the benefits were offset due to a preexisting debt is not an issue for appellate consideration before the Board. The Board reiterates that the appeal does not dispute the existence, validity, or amount of the debt, nor has the Appellant contended that he did not receive the June 2022 payment via direct deposit which VA found was erroneously paid to him. The sole issue on appeal, as stated by the Appellant, is the receipt of Chapter 35 educational benefits for the month of August 2022. As noted by the October 2022 RO decision letter, this issue was resolved after recoupment of the debt, and the Appellant received a net payment including the relevant portion of the month at issue.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. Here, the requested payment of VA educational assistance benefits under Chapter 35 was ultimately approved. As such, the relief the Appellant sought has been provided and there is no case or controversy left for the Board to decide, and the issue on appeal to the Board is therefore rendered moot. In other words, there is no longer a question or controversy remaining for this issue. The ultimate relief sought on appeal has been accomplished without the need for action by the Board. 38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7104, 7105; see also Thomas v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 269, 270 (1996); Hudgins v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 365, 367-68 (1995) (discussing exceptions to mootness).

Accordingly, the appeal seeking payment of Chapter 35 DEA benefits for the month of August 2022 is dismissed as moot. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).
