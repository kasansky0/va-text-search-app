ORDER

Eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran pursuant to a September 2022 rating decision is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's April 2022 appointment of the Appellant as attorney and the associated April 2022 fee agreement ("April 2022 Fee Agreement") between the Veteran and the Appellant are valid for purposes of the award of fees. 

2. An October 2018 rating decision granted service connection for the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric disability and assigned a disability rating of 30 percent, effective August 14, 2018 (the "October 2018 Rating Decision"). 

3. On April 12, 2022, the Appellant submitted VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim on behalf of the Veteran (the "April 2022 Intent to File"), and in May 2022, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, a VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, and accompanying argument on behalf of the Veteran, seeking review of the October 2018 Rating Decision (the "May 2022 Supplemental Claim").

4. In a September 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded the following: (1) a rating of 70 percent for the service-connected acquired psychiatric disability; (2) a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU); and (3) eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 (DEA benefits), all effective April 12, 2022, the date of the April 2022 Intent to File (the "September 2022 Rating Decision").

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the September 2022 Rating Decision have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2022 fee decision (the "October 2022 Fee Decision") issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which constitutes an initial decision on the issue of attorney fees; therefore, the modernized review system, governed by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

The Appellant represents the Veteran before VA but does not represent the Veteran in the current matter, because the Appellant is the contesting claimant.  

In December 2022, the Appellant timely filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (the "December 2022 NOD") in response to the October 2022 Fee Decision on appeal and elected the Direct Review docket.  In January 2025, the Veteran was provided with a redacted copy of the Appellant's December 2022 NOD pursuant to contested claims procedures (the "January 2025 Notice"); however, the Veteran has not filed a response to the December 2022 NOD or elected to change the docket.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403, 20.404.  Therefore, this contested claim remains on the Direct Review docket, and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 Fee Decision on appeal and a brief or argument filed by the Veteran within thirty (30) days of the January 2025 Notice.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405.  

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.

ATTORNEY FEES

Eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran pursuant to the September 2022 Rating Decision is granted.

The Appellant asserts that the direct payment of fees is warranted based upon the September 2022 Rating Decision granting the following: (1) an increased rating of 70 percent for the service-connected acquired psychiatric disability, effective April 12, 2022; (2) a TDIU, effective April 12, 2022; and (3) DEA benefits, effective April 12, 2022.

After careful review, and for the reasons set forth below, the Board agrees and finds that the Appellant is eligible for the direct payment of fees based on past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran pursuant to the September 2022 Rating Decision, and the claim is granted.

VA claimants are permitted to appoint an attorney or agent as representatives in connection with the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904.  In order to appoint an attorney or agent as his or her representative, the claimant must submit a validly executed VA Form 21-22a, Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative, which must meet the following requirements: (1) the form must be signed by (a) the claimant; (b) the claimant's guardian; or (c) in the case of an incompetent, minor, or otherwise incapacitated person without a guardian, the claimant's spouse, parent, other relative or friend (if interests are not adverse), or the director of the hospital in which the claimant is maintained; (2) the form must be signed by the attorney or agent providing representation; and (3) the form must be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the claims file.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a). 

The claimant may revoke a power of attorney and discharge an agent or attorney at any time, and, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the receipt of a new VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a executed by the claimant and the representative shall constitute revocation of an existing power of attorney.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1).

In order to be valid, all fee agreements between a claimant and an attorney or agent must be in writing, signed by both the claimant and the representative, and must include the following: (1) the name of the veteran; (2) if other than the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant; (3) the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the veteran, claimant, or appellant; (4) the applicable VA file number; and (5) the specific criteria for determining the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).

Fee agreements must also clearly specify whether VA shall pay the attorney or agent directly out of past-due benefits ("direct-pay fee agreement").   See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g)(2).  A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to directly pay the attorney or agent out of past-due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the attorney or agent is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA.  See id.   A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within thirty (30) days of its execution.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g)(3).  

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of attorneys or agents with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1); see also Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28, 32-34 (2023).

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the attorney or agent (i) is to be paid to the attorney or agent by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(1), (2).  Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be reasonable if the representation continued through the date of the decision awarding benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f)(1).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by the AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  Attorney or agent fees may be calculated based on the total amount of past-due benefits awarded to the veteran regardless of the amount actually paid to the veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020).

Where the benefit granted on appeal or as the result of the readjudicated claim involves service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  See id.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the attorney or agent represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the attorney or agent will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Appellant has been serving as the Veteran's duly appointed representative since April 2022, when the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22a appointing the Appellant as representative, and the parties executed the April 2022 Fee Agreement providing that the Appellant would be entitled to the direct payment of fees in the amount of 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded by VA.  As the record reflects that the April 2022 VA Form 21-22a and Fee Agreement comply with the applicable VA regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that both are valid for purposes of the award of fees.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.627, 14.631, 14.636. 

The Board further finds that the October 2018 Rating Decision granting service connection for the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric disability and assigning a disability rating of 30 percent, effective August 14, 2018, constitutes the initial decision with respect to the case that resulted in the September 2022 award of a higher rating for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability, a TDIU, and eligibility for DEA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  

In addition, the Board finds that the required contested claims procedures have been completed, as, in January 2025, the Veteran was provided a copy of the Appellant's redacted December 2022 NOD, and in March 2025, both the Veteran and the Appellant were provided additional notice that the December 2022 NOD was placed on the Board's direct review docket.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403, 20.404.

Regarding the nature of the services provided by the Appellant, in response to the October 2018 Rating Decision, the Appellant filed the April 2022 Intent to File and the May 2022 Supplemental Claim, along with a TDIU application and argument, on behalf of the Veteran seeking review of the October 2018 Rating Decision's assignment of a 30 percent disability rating for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability.  Thereafter, in the September 2022 Rating Decision, the Veteran was awarded a higher rating of 70 percent for the service-connected acquired psychiatric disability, as well as a TDIU, effective April 12, 2022.  

Despite these findings, in the October 2022 Fee Decision, the AOJ advised the parties that "VA never received a qualifying request to review this decision. Therefore, this award warrants no direct payment of fees."

However, for the following reasons, the Board finds that the Appellant is eligible for the direct payment of fees in the amount of 20 percent of the past-due benefits paid to the Veteran pursuant to the September 2022 Rating Decision.

First, the record reflects that the Appellant has complied with the power of attorney requirements, and that the April 2022 Fee Agreement is valid.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.627, 14.631, 14.636.  

Second, the October 2018 Rating Decision assigned a 30 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric disability, which the Board finds constitutes the initial decision with respect to the case in this instance. In that regard, the Appellant submitted a qualifying request for review of the October 2018 Rating Decision after February 19, 2019; namely, the May 2022 Supplemental Claim, seeking review of the ratings for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities and asserting, in relevant part, that the 2018 rating decision should have considered whether the Veteran was entitled to a TDIU in connection with adjudication of those ratings.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1139 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (explain that "[r]estricting the effective date of § 5104C(b) supplemental claims simply reflects a legislative choice to award claimants who delayed seeking review of their claims for over a year fewer benefits than those who 'continuously pursued' administrative review. It says nothing of Congress's intent to restrict attorneys' fees or limit a claimant's ability to retain paid representation for § 5104C(b) supplemental claims."); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1). The TDIU form and argument that accompanied the 2022 claim asserted the Veteran had been incapable of being more than marginally employed as a result of service-connected disabilities that included his acquired psychiatric disability since 2016. In short, although the timing of the 2022 filing precludes a finding of continuous pursuit for purposes of awarding additional benefits to the Veteran, the 2022 claim was not, in this instance, a "claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating or rate of a benefit paid based on a change or worsening in condition or circumstance since the last decision issued by VA for the benefit." See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(1)(ii). 

As a result of the 2022 review request, the September 2022 Rating Decision awarded the Veteran the following: (1) a rating of 70 percent for the service-connected acquired psychiatric disability; (2) a TDIU; and (3) DEA benefits, all effective April 12, 2022, the date the Appellant submitted the April 2022 Intent to File on behalf of the Veteran. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(3).

Accordingly, in light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria have been met for eligibility for direct payment of fees of 20 percent of the past-due benefits paid to the Veteran pursuant to the September 2022 Rating Decision, and the appeal is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904.
