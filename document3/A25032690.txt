REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1979 to May 1984.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on an appeal from an April 2023 higher level review decision, following a December 2022 finding of a duty-to-assist error in a November 2022 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). Because of the duty-to-assist error, the April 2023 higher level review decision processed the challenge to the denial of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to PTSD in the supplemental review lane.

In a January 2025 clarification of the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ supplemental review decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to PTSD.

In the April 2023 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran challenged the denial of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to his service-connected PTSD. April 2023 appellate brief, filed with the April 2023 Notice of Disagreement. The Veteran asserted that the March 2023 VA examination was inadequate to adjudicate his claim because the examiner addressed only causation and not aggravation of the secondary disability by the primary service-connected disability. As well, the Veteran contended that the VA examinations were inadequate because it failed to address the Veteran's obesity as an intermediary step in secondary causation.

As an initial matter, neither the July 2022 nor the March 2023 VA examinations for sleep apnea addressed direct service connection, although the Veteran stated, in the July 2022 VA examination that, beginning in 1982 and 1983, he experienced ongoing lack of sleep, sleeping only about 1.5 hours at a time, and irritability from lack of sleep. That time period was during the Veteran's active duty. The Board must consider all theories of entitlement to BA benefits that are raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 53 (2011). Moreover, once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide an adequate one. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007), abrogated on other grounds by Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In failing to address direct service connection, despite evidence in the record that the Veteran's sleep apnea began in service, the VA medical opinions were inadequate to adjudicate the Veteran's sleep apnea claim based on all theories of entitlement raised by the record. The inadequate examination and opinions constituted a pre-decisional duty to assist error and requires a remand for an adequate medical opinion regarding direct service connection, including consideration of the Veteran's report in the July 2022 VA examination that his symptoms began in service. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

During the pendency of this appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clarified the standard for secondary service connection. See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2023). Specifically, establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a)-(b). Secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain. Spicer, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (citations omitted). Secondary aggravation exists when the non-service-connected disability, although not caused by a service-connected disability, would be less severe were it not for the service-connected disability. Id. at 1364. 

Two VA opinions addressed whether the Veteran's sleep apnea was proximately caused by his PTSD, but neither addressed whether his sleep apnea was aggravated by the PTSD. See July 2022 and March 2023 VA medical opinions. The July 2022 and March 2023 VA examinations were therefore inadequate for adjudication of the Veteran's sleep apnea claim as secondary to PTSD. Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 312. The inadequate examinations predated the April 2023 supplemental review decision and remand is required to correct this additional pre-decisional duty to assist error by obtaining a VA opinion addressing the question of secondary aggravation. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); see, e.g., El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-41 (2013).

As well, the March 2023 VA medical opinion noted obesity and alcohol use as potential causative factors for the Veteran's sleep apnea, but did not address either as an intermediate step between the Veteran's PTSD and his sleep apnea. As to obesity, although obesity cannot be service connected on a direct basis, it can serve as an intermediate step between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 306-07 (2020); VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 (Jan 6, 2017). As noted, the Board must consider all theories of entitlement raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record. DeLisio, 25 Vet. App. at 53; Garner v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 241 (2021). The Veteran's VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran was diagnosed with obesity in March 2014. Given the evidence and the Veteran's argument as to a link between the Veteran's PTSD, his obesity, and his sleep apnea, a remand based on the pre-decisional duty to assist error of the VA examiner failing to address obesity as an intermediary step is warranted to obtain an adequate opinion as to obesity as an intermediate step in secondary causation or aggravation. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802; Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 312. 

As with obesity, alcohol use itself is not a disease or injury for which direct or secondary service connection may be granted. Service connection is generally not available for disabilities resulting from a Veteran's own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs. 38 U.S.C. § 1110. However, 38 U.S.C. § 1110 does not preclude compensation for an alcohol or drug abuse disability that is secondary to or caused by a primary service-connected disability. See Allen v. Principi, 237 F.3d. 1368, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Therefore, consistent with Allen, alcohol abuse caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected PTSD may serve as an intermediate step in a causal chain between his seizure disorder and his service-connected PTSD.

VA treatment records reflect a history of alcohol use and abuse concurrent with the Veteran's PTSD. As early as August 2011, a VA mental health consult reported that diagnoses of both PTSD and alcohol abuse should be ruled out based on the initial mental health evaluation conducted that day. In September 2019, a VA diagnostic evaluation diagnosed PTSD and simultaneously noted that alcohol use disorder should be ruled out. VA treatment notes reflecting alcohol abuse also date the disorder from the date of the September 2019 PTSD diagnosis. Moreover, in VA treatment records for October 2021 and January 2022, an October 2021 trauma recovery program psychotherapy intake, and the December 2021 VA PTSD examination, the Veteran reported having previously used alcohol excessively. In the October 2021 intake, the Veteran reported that he used alcohol as a distraction from his trauma-related memories. In fall 2021 and early 2022, however, the Veteran reported to VA care providers that he had substantially reduced his alcohol intake approximately a year prior, and VA treatment records after that time reflect that the Veteran reported consuming some alcohol, but less than he reported in October 2019, although alcohol abuse remained on his active problem list in VA treatment records. Compare VA treatment records for June 16, 2022; January 12, 2022; November 1, 2021; with VA treatment record for October 1, 2019. 

Despite the abundance of evidence in the record regarding the Veteran's use of alcohol suggesting a relationship to the Veteran's PTSD, the July 2022 VA examiner did not address in any manner the Veteran's alcohol use, his sleep apnea, and his PTSD. Further, although the March 2023 VA medical opinion specifically cited the Veteran's alcohol use as a potential cause of sleep apnea, the examiner did not address alcohol as a potential intermediate step in secondary causation or aggravation. The July 2022 and March 2023 VA examination and medical opinions are therefore inadequate on these grounds as well and a remand required to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802; Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 312. 

The Board by this remand makes no determination, expressed or implied, concerning the credibility of any statements on file.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum medical opinion to evaluate the nature and etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea. The claims file must be made available to be reviewed by the examiner, and a note that it was reviewed should be included in the report. If the examiner determines that an additional examination of the Veteran is necessary to provide a reliable opinion, such examination should be scheduled.

After reviewing the claims file, the examiner must determine the following:

a.	Was the Veteran's sleep apnea incurred in service, including during the years 1982 and 1983 when the Veteran reported sleep difficulties and daytime irritability, or otherwise directly related to service?

b.	Whether the Veteran's sleep apnea would be less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD, particularly in light of the Veteran's reports of sleep difficulties in 1982 and 1983 in service. 

c.	If the answer to b. above is negative, the examiner should also address whether, but for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, to include PTSD, he would not have become obese or have developed an alcohol abuse disorder.

d.	Whether the Veteran's obesity or alcohol use disorder would be less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, to include PTSD.

The examiner is reminded that the Veteran's service-connected disability does not have to be the "sole" reason for his obesity or alcohol abuse.

e.	If the examiner finds that, but for his service-connected disabilities, the Veteran would not have become obese or developed an alcohol abuse disorder, which is to say that the opinion in (c.) is positive, an opinion should be offered for each of the following:

i.	Whether, but for the Veteran's obesity or alcohol abuse, he would not have a current disability of sleep apnea.

ii.	Whether, but for the Veteran's obesity or alcohol abuse, the Veteran's sleep apnea would be less severe and result in less functional impairment.

f.	If the examiner finds that, but for his service-connected disabilities, the Veteran's obesity or alcohol abuse was aggravated (would be less severe but for service-connected disabilities) by his service-connected disabilities, to include PTSD, which is to say that the opinion for (d.) is positive, an opinion should be offered for each of the following: 

i.	Whether, but for the increase in the Veteran's obesity or alcohol use due to his service-connected disabilities, he would have a current disability of sleep apnea.

ii.	Whether, but for the increase in the Veteran's obesity or alcohol use due to his service-connected disabilities, the Veteran's sleep apnea would be less severe and result in less functional impairment

A detailed rationale for the opinions must be provided. If the examiner is unable to offer the requested opinions, it is essential that the examiner offer a rationale for the conclusion that an opinion could not be provided without resort to speculation, together with a statement as to whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.

If the examiner opines that the sleep apnea would result in less functional impairment but for the service-connected disabilities, obesity, or alcohol use disorder, or increase in obesity or alcohol use, the examiner must attempt to establish a baseline level of severity of the diagnosed disability prior to the increase in functional impairment resulting from the primary service-connected disability, obesity, alcohol abuse, or increase in obesity or alcohol use.
