REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Navy, on active duty from March 1969 to February 1973. His awards include the Vietnam Campaign Medal, among others. 

This claim comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) dated January 2024. That same month, he submitted a VA Form 10182, selecting the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision.

The Board notes that the Veteran has multiple appeals concerning the issue of entitlement to TDIU. Specifically, he submitted a VA Form 10182 dated June 2021, appealing a February 2021 rating decision and selected the Hearing docket. Subsequently, the Veteran continuously appealed rating decisions denying TDIU dated February 2022, November 2022, and January 2024. These continuous submissions by the Veteran and responses by the RO have clouded the procedural history of this matter. 

However, even with this clarification, because of the aforementioned multiple appeal streams with different evidentiary windows and appeal lanes, the Board is aware that another appeal from June 1, 2021, is pending. 

The Board regrets any confusion these two competing Board decisions, based on distinct evidentiary windows, may cause the Veteran. 

However, the Board finds that, given the evidence in this docket's evidentiary window, this instant appeal is ripe for adjudication, particularly as it grants entitlement to TDIU in the Veteran's favor.  

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by applying a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity based on the specific diagnostic codes identifying the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. §1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Where there is a question as to which of two separate evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria required for that particular rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

For musculoskeletal disabilities, a higher rating may be granted based on greater limitation of motion due to pain on use, including during flare-ups. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4. 10, 4.40, 4.45; see also DeLuca v. Brown, 8Vet. App. 202 (1995). The intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability, and therefore, actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, are entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 (avoidance of pyramiding) do not forbid consideration of a higher rating based on greater limitation of motion due to pain on use, including flare-ups.

The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings," in all claims for increased ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999).

The Veteran has continuously appealed rating decisions, either through Supplemental Claims or Higher-Level-Review requests, since being granted service connection for these disabilities in a May 2019 rating decision. Therefore, the Board finds that the period on appeal begins on the date he filed his initial service connection claims, May 7, 2018. Moreover, the evidentiary window closes in January 2024, the date of the rating decision on appeal.

The Veteran contends that his right- and left-hand finger symptoms are worse than currently rated. Unfortunately, after a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that ratings in excess of those already assigned for fingers of his right- and left- hand are not warranted. 

In a May 2019 rating decision, the RO granted the Veteran service connection for each finger of both hands. His fingers were each rated as noncompensable under Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 5228, 5229, and 5230. In the rating decision on appeal, the RO granted increased ratings of 10 percent for his right and left index finger, right and left long finger, right and left thumb, effective March 25, 2022.

 

Under DC 5228, for either the major or minor hand:

"	a noncompensable rating is warranted for limited motion with a gap of less than one inch (2.5 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers;

"	a 10 percent rating is warranted for limited motion with a gap of one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers;

"	a maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for limited motion with a gap of more than two inches (5.1 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.

 

Under DC 5229, for either the major or the minor hand:

"	a noncompensable rating is warranted for limited motion of the index or long finger with a gap of less than one inch (2.5 cm.) between the fingertip and the proximal transverse crease of the palm, with the finger flexed to the extent possible, and; extension is limited by no more than 30 degrees;

"	a maximum 10 percent rating is warranted when there is limited motion with a gap of one inch (2.5 cm.) or more between the fingertip and the proximal transverse crease of the palm, with the finger flexed to the extent possible, or; with extension limited by more than 30 degrees.

Under DC 5230, for either the major hand or the minor hand, a noncompensable rating is warranted for any limitation of motion of the ring or little finger.

As the diagnostic codes that rate hand disabilities allow multiple digits to be combined into a single diagnostic code, it is necessary to consider all possible higher digit-combination criteria. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5216 to 5230. 

For the index, long, ring, and little fingers (digits II, III, IV, and V), zero degrees of flexion represents the fingers fully extended, making a straight line with the rest of the hand. The position of function of the hand is with the wrist dorsiflexed 20 to 30 degrees, the metacarpophalangeal (MP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints flexed to 30 degrees, and the thumb (digit I) abducted and rotated so that the thumb pad faces the finger pads. Only joints in these positions are considered in favorable position. For digits II through V, the MP joint has a range of 0 to 90 degrees of flexion, the PIP joint has a range of zero to 100 degrees of flexion, and the DIP joint has a range of 0 to 70 or 80 degrees of flexion. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5216-5230, Note (1).

Ankylosis is immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, surgical procedure. Nix v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 462, 465 (1993); Shipwash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 218, 221 (1995). Ankylosis is stiffening or fixation of a joint as the result of a disease process, with fibrous or bony union across the joint. Dinsay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 79, 81 (1996). In the absence of a medical diagnosis of ankylosis, a claimant may still receive a rating under ankylosis based on the functional equivalent of ankylosis (i.e., the claimant's symptoms sufficiently resemble ankylosis despite the absence of a formal diagnosis). Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, (2021). In short, if a claimant's functional loss "is the functional equivalent of ankylosis," a higher rating may be warranted on that basis.

Potentially also relevant here, are DCs 5216 through 5227, which contemplate ankylosis of one or multiple digits of the hand. However, the evidence of record does not show ankylosis, either favorable or unfavorable, of the Veteran's digits. Thus, the Board does not discuss these rating criteria below. 

The Board notes that portions of the rating schedule addressing the musculoskeletal system were revised effective February 7, 2021. However, those changes did not affect Diagnostic Codes 5228, 5229, and 5230, relating to single and multiple digits of the hand.

Prior to March 25, 2022

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in April 2019. Here, he reported being right hand dominant and was diagnosed with clubbing of all five digits in each hand. He denied flareups or functional loss due to repeated use over time. Upon examination, he denied pain in the digits of either the right or left hands, and the examiner noted no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation. He was able to perform repetitive use testing, however, there was no functional loss or range of motion after three repetitions. While he was not being examined immediately after repetitive use over time, the examiner opined that his examination was neither medically consistent nor inconsistent with his statements regarding functional loss with repetitive use over time. 

Upon examination, the Veteran was able to exhibit normal strength of 5/5 in grip for both hands. Moreover, the examiner observed no muscle atrophy, no ankylosis, or other pertinent physical findings of the digits in both hands. The Veteran reported no use of an assistive device, and the VA examiner opined that his condition caused no functional impact.

The April 2019 VA examiner provided an addendum opinion in May 2019. Here, the VA examiner opined that all of the Veteran's fingers and thumbs had normal range of motion. Moreover, the VA examiner noted that he had "no finger gaps in any of [the] fingers or thumb."

In November 2019, the Veteran underwent another VA examination. Here, counter to his previous examination, he reported being left-hand dominant. Moreover, he described numbness and pain in the fingertips, however, he denied flareups and functional loss or impairment. Upon examination, the VA examiner found his range of motion to be "all normal" for both the right and left hand. Furthermore, the VA examiner observed no gap between the finger and proximal transverse crease, nor a gap between the pad of the thumb and the fingers in either hand. Although the Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing, there was no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions. Despite not being examined immediately after repetitive use over time, the Veteran did not report any loss of function. His muscle strength in both hands was measured as 5/5, normal, and the examiner indicated there was no ankylosis. Overall, the November 2019 VA examiner opined that his right- and left-hand disorders caused some functional impact. Specifically, that he is unable to perform activities that require fine dexterity, for example, typing on a computer and tying his shoes. 

Next, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination regarding a rheumatoid arthritis claim in November 2020. The examining clinician noted arthritic pain in his shoulders, wrists, feet, ankles and hands/fingers. He was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis of the bilateral hands, and he reported being ambidextrous. At worst, the range of motion of his fingers were normal except for his right ring finger and left little finger. Here, his initial range of motion for the right ring finger were to 75 degrees MCP, 70 degrees PIP, and 20 degrees DIP. The examiner measured a 1-centimeter gap between the pad of the thumb and fingers, and a 1-centimeter gap between the finger and proximal transverse crease of the hand. 

As to the Veteran's left hand, the November 2020 VA examiner measured his left little finger to 30 degrees DIP. All other ROM measurement of the left fingers were normal. However, the examiner noted a 1.5-centimeter gap between the pad of the thumb and the fingers, with a 1-centimeter gap between the fingers and proximal transverse crease of the hand. The VA examiner observed repetitive use testing, however, there was no additional functional loss. While he was unable to perform repetitive use over time, the examiner opined that based on his claims file, there was no additional functional loss. Further, he denied flareups, and the examiner noted no ankylosis of the digits of either hand. While diagnosing him with rheumatoid arthritis, the VA examiner noted that there are no imaging studies of record. Overall, the November 2020 VA examiner opined that his right- and left-hand disorders caused difficulty with gripping, holding and grasping objects. 

Subsequently, in November 2021, the Veteran underwent another VA examination. Here, he was diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the right- and left-hand. His initial range of motion measurements were normal; however, he did report pain, and the examiner opined that it caused no functional loss. Moreover, the VA examiner observed no gaps between the pad of the thumb and fingers, nor the fingers and hand crease upon examination. While he exhibited pain on weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, active and passive motion, the VA examiner opined that it did not result or cause functional loss. He performed repetitive use testing without additional functional loss, while his statements, according to the examiner, indicated he would not suffer from additional loss immediately after repeated use. He denied flareups, and the examiner opined there was no ankylosis. While imaging studies confirmed osteoarthritis, the VA examiner confirmed he did not have arthritis in multiple joints of the same hand. Overall, the VA examiner concluded that his hand conditions cause him to be unable to form a grip, however, he is still able to drive. 

After a review of the April 2019, November 2019, November 2020, and November 2021 VA examination reports, the Board finds that an increased rating for the Veteran's right- and left-hand disorders during this period is not warranted. Specifically, during this period, his right-hand range of motion was measured, at worst, to 75 degrees MCP, 70 degrees PIP, and 20 degrees DIP of the ring finger. Moreover, his left-hand ROM was measured at worst to 30 degrees DIP of the left little finger. The gap, in either hand, between his pad of the thumb and fingers, or between his fingers and the proximal transverse crease, was measured at worst to 1.5 and 1-centimeters. As he did not exhibit gaps greater than 2.5 centimeters, an increased rating under either DC 5228 or DC 5229 is not for application. While there was some pain noted on examination, he did not exhibit unfavorable or favorable ankylosis in any digit of either hand, thus, noncompensable ratings are appropriate for this period. 

Thus, compensable ratings for the Veteran's right- and left-hand digits for the period prior to March 25, 2022, are not warranted. 

From March 25, 2022

From March 25, 2022, the Veteran's right- and left-hand finger and thumb disabilities are rated as follows, bilateral thumbs, bilateral index and bilateral long fingers, each rated as 10 percent disabling. His bilateral ring and little fingers remain rated as noncompensable. 

In July 2023, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination. Here, the VA examiner continued his rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, and the Veteran reported stiffness and pain while denying flareups. Upon examination, he exhibited decreased range of motion in the MCP, PIP and DIP, of all fingers and thumbs of both hands with pain. He was observed after repetitive and repeated use, however there was no additional functional loss. Further, the VA examiner observed no gap between the pad of the thumb and fingers, and no gap between the fingers and proximal transverse crease of either hand at any point during the examination. His muscle strength was measured as 5/5 for the right hand, and 4/5 for the left hand. There was no muscle atrophy, nor was there ankylosis. Occupationally, the condition interfered with the Veteran's ability to grab smaller items and button his shirts. 

During this period, the VA examination of record does not show symptoms that would warrant higher ratings. Indeed, the Veteran is currently in receipt of the maximum ratings under DCs 5229 and 5230 for limitation of motion of the index, middle, ring and little fingers. A higher rating requires ankylosis or amputation. However, the evidence of record does not document ankylosis and/or amputation of multiple fingers of the Veteran's right and left hands sufficient to warrant higher ratings under DCs 5152 through 5156, and 5220 through 5223. Moreover, the evidence does not show a gap between the thumb pad and fingers greater than 2 inches, such that would warrant higher ratings under DC 5228 for the right- and left-thumb. 

The Board has also reviewed VA treatment records during this period. Relevant here, the Veteran complained of numbness in his fingers in December 2018. In November 2019, he reported recent issues with "triggering/locking" in a few fingers during the morning. Lastly, in April 2022, he told his VA clinician that he occasionally feels locking in his right ring finger. To the extent that these statements may be argued to show the functional equivalent of ankylosis, the Board is not convinced. Given the multiple VA examination reports of record throughout the entire period on appeal that persuasively show the Veteran's hand/fingers disorders are not manifested by ankylosis, the Board finds that increased ratings under ankylosis is not for application. 

Entitlement to a higher rating under DC 5125 (hand, loss of use) has also been considered. However, the VA examination reports failed to show that there was functional impairment of either hand, and associated digits, such that no effective functions remained other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation and prothesis. Taken together, the loss of use of either hand - even when accounting for additional limitation of the digits, has not been shown. 

As noted, the Veteran's complaints and contentions of functional impairment include difficulty gripping and picking up objects. These statements have been considered and the Board notes his pain causes impairment with performing daily activities. However, the Board finds that the currently assigned ratings contemplate the Veteran's functional impairment due to limitation of motion, pain, and decreased strength. 

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against assignment of ratings in excess of those already assigned for the Veteran's right- and left-thumb, right- and left-index, middle, ring and little fingers.

12. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for polyneuropathy of the left lower extremity.

13. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for polyneuropathy of the right upper extremity.

14. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for polyneuropathy of the left upper extremity.

The Veteran contends that his polyneuropathy of the upper and lower bilateral extremities is worse than presently rated. After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that increased ratings are not warranted. 

The Veteran's polyneuropathy disabilities are evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Schedule of Ratings - Neurological Conditions and Convulsive Disorders. His polyneuropathy of the bilateral upper extremities is each rated as 20 percent disabling under DC 8513 from May 7, 2018. His polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities is each rated as 10 percent disabling under DC 8520 from March 25, 2022.

The rating criteria under DC 8513, which compensates for the upper radicular group, paralysis of the hands, are as follows:

"	a 20 percent rating for mild incomplete paralysis, major side, or dominant hand, and minor side, or non-dominant hand;

"	a 30 percent rating for moderate incomplete paralysis, minor side;

"	a 40 percent rating for moderate incomplete paralysis, major side;

"	a 60 percent rating for severe incomplete paralysis, minor side;

"	a 70 percent evaluation for severe incomplete paralysis, major side

38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8513. 

Under DC 8520, which compensates for neurological disabilities manifested by paralysis of the sciatic nerve, under the rating criteria:

"	a 10 percent rating is warranted for mild incomplete paralysis;

"	a 20 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis; 

"	a 40 percent rating is warranted for moderately severe incomplete paralysis

38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520. 

The words "marked," "mild," "moderate" and "severe" are not defined in the Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue. Rather, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding a request for an increased disability rating. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Neither the Rating Schedule nor the regulations provide definitions for descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe." Sellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 157 (2018). It should also be noted that use of terminology such as "mild" and "moderate" by VA examiners or other physicians, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must instead evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.

In the absence of guidance in the rating criteria itself, the Board will consider the dictionary definitions for these subjective adjectives. "Slight" or mild is defined as small in amount; "moderate" as limited in scope or effect; and "severe" as very painful or harmful, or of a great degree. Meriam Webster College Dictionary (11th ed. 2007).

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran underwent a VA examination regarding his peripheral nerves in November 2019. Here, he was diagnosed with bilateral upper extremity peripheral neuropathy and told the VA examiner that he was left hand dominant. He reported numbness and pain in the fingertips, with limited fine dexterity, and taking Gabapentin for the pain. Upon examination, he demonstrated mild incomplete paralysis of the bilateral upper radial, median and ulnar nerves. However, his muscle strength and reflex testing were normal, while his hand/finger sensory results were decreased. 

Next, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2020. Here, the results were mostly the same. The VA examiner continued his diagnosis, while noting his Gabapentin treatment. Upon examination, he exhibited mild bilateral upper extremity constant pain, intermittent pain, paresthesias, and numbness. While his muscle strength was normal and he did not have muscle atrophy, his reflex exam revealed his brachioradialis reflexes to be "absent." Further, his hand/fingers sensory testing results revealed he had "decreased" sensation. Notably, his radial, median and ulnar nerves were observed to cause mild incomplete paralysis. 

As discussed above, the Veteran's bilateral upper extremity polyneuropathy is rated as 20 percent disabling throughout the period on appeal, while his bilateral lower extremity polyneuropathy is rated as 10 percent disabling from March 25, 2022. 

In November 2023, the Veteran underwent another VA examination. Here, the VA examiner diagnosed him with polyneuropathy of all four extremities and reported being ambidextrous. Upon examination, the VA examiner found moderate constant and intermittent pain of the bilateral lower extremities, as well as moderate paresthesias and numbness. For his bilateral upper extremities, the VA examiner determined his intermittent pain, paresthesias and numbness to be mild. He exhibited 4/5 muscle strength, except for his right knee extension which was normal. He did not have muscle atrophy, and his reflex examination results were normal. His right hand/fingers, right lower leg, and right foot exhibited decreased sensation. 

The November 2023 VA examiner noted no trophic changes, and the Veteran had a normal gait. His right median nerve was positive for Phalen's and Tinel's signs. Despite this, the VA examiner opined that his bilateral upper extremity polyneuropathy caused mild incomplete paralysis of the median and ulnar nerves. Moreover, his bilateral lower extremity neuropathy caused mild incomplete paralysis of the external popliteal. He did not use assistive devices, however, the VA examiner opined that his condition restricted his ability to walk more than two city blocks and increased his risk for falls. 

Overall, the VA examinations of record fail to demonstrate that increased ratings are warranted throughout the period on appeal for the Veteran's polyneuropathy. Specifically, the VA examiners opined that, at worst, his bilateral and lower extremity polyneuropathy caused mild, incomplete paralysis of each extremity. The evidence does not show "moderate" incomplete paralysis for any extremity, as to warrant higher ratings under DCs 8513 and 8520. Given the findings of the VA examiners of record, the Board finds that increased ratings for the Veteran's polyneuropathy are not warranted. 

Other evidence of record includes VA treatment notes; however, these also do not show that increased ratings are warranted. For example, in October 2021, the Veteran complained to a VA clinician that his mobility was partially limited by his bilateral lower extremity neuropathy. Further, in a June 2023 VA treatment note, he reported having to use a chair in the shower because of his neuropathy. While these treatment notes are probative, the Board finds them to be contemplated under his current rating criteria. Indeed, his treating clinicians do not indicate his polyneuropathy to cause mild moderate, or severe paralysis of any limb. 

In summary, the most probative evidence of record is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's symptoms of bilateral upper and lower extremity polyneuropathy warrant increased ratings. Using the definitions listed above for "mild" and "moderate", the Board finds that his symptoms are less persistent and less severe than is required for increased ratings, and his disabilities do not present such an exception or unusual picture as to render the Rating Schedule impractical. Therefore, consideration for extraschedular evaluation is not for application. 

In considering the appropriate disability ratings for the Veteran's right- and left-hand/fingers, bilateral upper and lower extremity polyneuropathy disabilities, the Board has also considered the statements from the veteran that his disabilities are worse than the ratings he currently receives. Specifically, he states that his polyneuropathy causes numbness, tingling and interferes with his ability to walk. While his bilateral hand/finger disabilities cause problems making a fist and, at one point, his right index finger was "locked." In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).

Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. Although the Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses, he is not competent to identify a specific level of disability of his disabilities according to the appropriate DC. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) ("although interest may affect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect competency to testify").

On the other hand, such competent evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's right and left hand/fingers, bilateral upper and lower extremity polyneuropathy disabilities, have been provided by the medical personnel who have examined him during the current appeal and who have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with their evaluations. The medical findings of the VA examiners (as provided in the examination reports) directly address the criteria under which his disabilities are evaluated. Specifically, although he contends that higher disability ratings are warranted, the impact of the symptoms of his disabilities were discussed and address by the VA examiners of record, and the Board finds their assessments of greater probative weight.

By virtue of the foregoing, the Board concludes that increased disability ratings are not warranted for the Veteran's bilateral hand/fingers, bilateral upper and lower extremity polyneuropathy disabilities. 

TDIU

Total disability will be considered to exist where there is present any impairment of mind and body that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340. Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that the Veteran meets the schedular requirements.

Specifically, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability that is ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

"Substantially gainful employment" is that employment "which is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides." Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991). "Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment." 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) (2018).

In determining whether a veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, the Court in Ray v. Wilkie directed to Board to consider the following factors: (1) the veteran's history, education, skill, and training; (2) whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and (3) whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue. 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019).

15. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU)

16. Entitlement to TDIU based on a single disability alone, for purposes of entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound status

The Veteran contends that he cannot work due to his service-connected disabilities. After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that entitlement to TDIU is warranted as of March 31, 2021. 

In the rating decision on appeal, the RO denied the Veteran's claim for TDIU as moot, because he currently holds a total 100 percent schedular rating. However, in some cases, but not all, the assignment of a total schedular rating renders a TDIU claim moot. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). The Veteran may receive a total (100 percent) rating based on a combination of his service-connected disabilities, or for a single service-connected disability. Special monthly compensation (SMC) may be warranted in addition to his regular compensation if the Veteran has a total disability rating for a single disability, and additional service-connected disability or disabilities rated at 60 percent or more. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250-51 (2011); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). The total rating for the single disability for SMC purposes may be schedular, or may be based on TDIU, so long as TDIU is warranted solely because of that single disability.

Further, the RO denied entitlement to TDIU prior to March 25, 2022, the date the Veteran was granted a total 100 percent rating based on a combination of his service-connected disabilities. 

Thus, the question before the Board is whether entitlement to TDIU is warranted prior to March 25, 2022, and whether TDIU, from that date, is moot based on his total schedular rating. 

The Veteran is rated for the following disabilities, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rated as 70 percent disabling from March 31, 2021; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rated as 30 percent disabling from March 31, 2021, and as 60 percent disabling from April 27, 2023; myocardial infarction, rated as 60 percent disabling from August 21, 2023; polyneuropathy of the bilateral upper extremities, each rated as 20 percent disabling from May 7, 2018; asbestosis, rated as 10 percent disabling from May 7, 2018, through March 31, 2021; bilateral clubbed thumb, bilateral index finger, and bilateral long finger, each rated as noncompensable from May 7, 2018, and as 10 percent disabling from March 25, 2022; polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities, each rated as 10 percent disabling from March 25, 2022; bilateral ring and bilateral little fingers, each rated as noncompensable from May 7, 2018; and scar of the chest post-bypass surgery, rated as noncompensable from August 21, 2023. His overall disability rating is 50 percent from May 7, 2018, 90 percent from March 31, 2021, and 100 percent from March 25, 2022. Thus, the threshold requirement for TDIU on a schedular basis is met from March 31, 2021. 

First, the Board addresses whether entitlement to TDIU prior to March 25, 2022, is warranted.

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that entitlement to TDIU, from March 31, 2021, but no earlier, is for application. 

The record reflects that the Veteran has not worked since June 2017. Specifically, his former employer submitted a statement in January 2023, indicating that his disabilities prevented him from performing the tasks of his job description. Moreover, his employer listed the medical conditions preventing him from completing tasks as "asbestosis related issues," labored breathing, and polyneuropathy. 

Further, the Veteran's VA examinations, from March 31, 2021, indicate that his service-connected disabilities prevent him from following a substantially gainful occupation. For example, in VA examinations dated April and August 2019, the VA clinician opined that his respiratory disorder limited him to light duty, or no physical work. Indeed, the August 2019 VA examiner opined that he would need to "rest as needed." The November 2019 VA examiner indicated that his polyneuropathy prevented him from performing activities requiring fine dexterity, such as typing on a computer, tying his shoes, and putting on his hearing aids. Moreover, his neuropathy limited him to walking short distances less than 50 yards. Finally, in November 2021, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his acquired psychiatric disorder. Here, the examiner noted symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. These symptoms, according to the VA examiner, cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. 

Taking the Veteran's VA examinations of record, the Board finds that, overall, he has been unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities since March 2021. The VA examinations of record are persuasive in showing that his service-connected psychiatric, respiratory and polyneuropathy disorders cause total occupational impairment. Based on these symptoms, the Board finds that the Veteran is unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment from that date. 

Extraschedular Consideration for TDIU

The Board has also considered whether referral to the Director of Compensation and Pension Service for extraschedular consideration is warranted for the period prior to March 31, 2021. However, after a review of the evidence, the Board finds that a referral is not warranted. 

If a Veteran fails to meet the threshold minimum percentage standards enunciated in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a), rating boards should refer to the Director of Compensation and Pension Service for extra-schedular consideration all cases where the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b). See also Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225 (1993).

Prior to March 31, 2021, the Veteran is not service connected for his acquired psychiatric disorder, nor his myocardial infarction or respiratory disorders - the primary basis for the Board's grant of TDIU above. His overall 50 percent rating during this period is for bilateral upper extremity polyneuropathy, and his bilateral hand/finger disorders. 

These disorders, according to the VA examination report, cause some functional impairment in this period. Specifically, his polyneuropathy of the upper extremities limited his dexterity and use of hands. His bilateral hand/finger disorders prevented him, at times, from forming a grip and being able to drive. However, during this period, VA examiners opined that his service-connected disabilities did not cause total occupational impairment. Indeed, the April 2019 VA examiner opined that his hand/finger disorders cause no functional impact and constituted a "mild disability." 

As the evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone prevented him from maintaining employment in general, the Board declines to remand the issue of entitlement to extraschedular TDIU prior to March 31, 2021, for further consideration. 

TDIU Based on a Single Disability for SMC Purposes

The Veteran having been granted a combined total disability rating from March 25, 2022, the award of a TDIU based on the Veteran's combined service-connected disabilities would be moot from that date. In this case, however, the Veteran has not been granted SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) during this time frame. Thus, his claim for a TDIU rating based upon a single disability from this date must be adjudicated as it could serve as a total rating for a single disability which could then serve as a basis to award additional benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).

Generally speaking, a 100 percent rating precludes entitlement to TDIU. However, the Board is required to maximize all possible benefits to a Veteran, to include consideration of special monthly compensation (SMC). Special monthly compensation benefits by reason of being housebound are payable if the Veteran has a single permanent disability rated 100 percent disabling and has either (1) additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) is "permanently housebound" by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i). The disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more must be separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i)(1).

Housebound benefits are not available to a Veteran whose 100 percent disability rating is based on multiple disabilities, none of which is rated at 100 percent disabling. Guerra v. Shinseki, 642 F.3d 1046 (Fed. Cir. 2011). However, a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) satisfies the total (100 percent) rating requirement if the TDIU evaluation was, or can be, predicated upon a single disability and there exists additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, for purposes of entitlement to special monthly compensation for a housebound rating. Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008). In other words, a TDIU rating based on a single disability, but not multiple disabilities, is permitted to satisfy the statutory requirement of a total rating. Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 293. 

Nonetheless, the TDIU rating based on a single disability that satisfies the total (100 percent) rating requirement must be separate and distinct from the additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more for purposes of housebound benefits. Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 293. In addition, the decision to treat multiple disabilities as one under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a) is specifically limited to TDIU ratings. That is, a TDIU rating based on multiple service-connected disabilities does not satisfy the criteria for one total disability in considering entitlement to housebound benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s). Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 290-91.

A "TDIU rating that is based on multiple disabilities cannot satisfy the section 1114(s) requirements of 'a service-connected disability' because that requirement must be met by a single disability." Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 249-250 (2010). However, VA's duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a claimant's disabilities, regardless of the order in which they were service connected, to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes housebound benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s). Buie, 24 Vet. App. at 249-250.

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's TDIU is warranted during this period based on a "single disability" of asbestosis with his COPD, clubbed fingers/thumbs, and bilateral upper extremity polyneuropathy. 

The Veteran's disabilities associated with asbestosis ("common etiology") have a combined rating of 80 percent as of March 31, 2021, and 90 percent from April 27, 2023, and thus meet the requirement for a grant of TDIU based on these disabilities alone when considering them as "one disability." See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. 

All of the Veteran's other disabilities may serve as the additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, for purposes of entitlement to SMC for a housebound rating. Indeed, the Veteran is separately rated for PTSD and myocardial infarction, each rated 60 percent or more. Thus, the question before the Board is whether the Veteran's asbestosis disabilities alone, from March 25, 2022, render him unemployable. 

As noted above, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2022 for his COPD. Here, the VA examiner opined that his respiratory disorder prevents him from performing "any type of activity" as he becomes short of breath. In another VA examination that same month, the examiner concluded that his hand/finger disabilities caused problems with grasping objects and using hands in "any type of way." These activities would be necessary to perform any type of physical work. Indeed, even if the Veteran were able to secure a sedentary position that involves computers, the VA examiners of record determined that his hand/finger disorders cause dexterity issues that prevent him from typing or manipulating objects with his hands. Given the Veteran's education and work background includes generally physical positions, his asbestosis related disorders prevent him from obtaining any physical or sedentary positions that involve his hand/fingers. Thus, affording him the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran's asbestosis disorders alone render him incapable of obtaining and maintaining gainful employment. Thus, TDIU may be granted based on this "single disability" alone for the purposes of granting SMC based on housebound status during any period where the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent combined disability rating.

 

Earlier Effective Date for DEA

17. Entitlement to an earlier effective date, other than March 25, 2022, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35

The Veteran seeks entitlement to DEA prior to March 25, 2022. Based on a review of the evidence, the Board determines that an earlier effective date of March 31, 2021, but no earlier, for DEA is warranted. 

Basic eligibility to DEA is established under 38 U.S.C. § Chapter 35 for a veteran's spouse or child if the veteran was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable and has a permanent and total service-connected disability, therefore, basic eligibility is established in this matter as of the earliest date that TDIU is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3020, 21.3021.

As the Veteran has been found to have a total and permanent rating as of March 31, 2021, the date he was found to be entitled to TDIU, eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is warranted from that date. However, an earlier effective date is not for application, as it is precluded by law. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501 (a)(1), 5113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807 (a), 21.3021. See also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

In short, March 31, 2021, is the first date the Veteran is found to have a permanent and total disability, as such, it is the earliest date that basic entitlement ot DEA benefits may be granted.
