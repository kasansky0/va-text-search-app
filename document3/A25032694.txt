ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to service connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder, is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

In December 2024 correspondence and prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to service connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, was requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to service connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1999 to August 1999, June 2001 and from March 2003 to November 2003, to include service in Southwest Asia. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of a service connection claim for hypertension most recently addressed in an April 2018 rating decision that was issued in May 2018. In June 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the August 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. In December 2024, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Preliminarily, the Board notes that VA received correspondence in January 2025 indicating that the Veteran's representative wished to withdraw her representation of the Veteran. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.6, after an appeal has been certified to the Board, a representative may not withdraw services as a representative unless good cause is shown on motion and the motion must be in writing and must comply with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 20.6. As the January 2025 submission did not identify good cause for the Motion to Withdraw and did not certify that a copy of the motion was sent to the Veteran, the Motion to Withdraw is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to service connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, is dismissed. 

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the veteran or by his authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

In December 2024, VA received correspondence wherein the Veteran, through his representative, indicated that he wished to withdraw the pending appeal and hearing. See December 2024 Correspondence.

The Board finds the correspondence to be clear, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action. See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011). The December 2024 correspondence included the name of the Veteran, the applicable claim number, and a statement that the issue on appeal has been withdrawn. As such, the Veteran has withdrawn his appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to service connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, and there remains no allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration therein. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the issue, and the claim for entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to service connected PTSD with major depressive disorder, is withdrawn.
