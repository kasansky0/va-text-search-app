ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for cervical kyphosis is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received a correspondence from the Veteran requesting a withdrawal of his appeal for entitlement to service connection for cervical kyphosis. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for cervical kyphosis have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1995 to December 1997. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2021 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.

Entitlement to service connection for cervical kyphosis

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204. In the present case, in March 2025, the Veteran requested a withdrawal of his claim for entitlement to service connection for cervical kyphosis.

Therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal for the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for cervical kyphosis, and the claim is dismissed.
