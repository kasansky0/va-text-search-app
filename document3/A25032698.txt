REMAND

Entitlement to eligibility for education benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 1606 (Selected Reserve GI Bill also known as the Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve or MGIB - SR) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on initial active duty for training in the United States Army Reserve from June 2009 until her honorable discharge in November 2009.  See November 2009 DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty).

The Veteran's service personnel records additionally reflect that she was ordered to active duty from July 2011 to September 2011 and from April 4, 2012, for a 3-year term.  See Service Personnel Records.  However, the record does not contain a DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) for either of the subsequent period(s) of active duty (nor any other period(s) of active duty).  The Board notes that the lack of a DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) is not dispositive.  However, in the present case, the record raises additional pertinent questions that have not been answered, including potential additional period(s) of active duty, current status, and character of discharge (if discharged).

Specifically, the record reflects an April 2013 DA Form 4187 (Personnel Action) that changes the Veteran's duty status from "Present For Duty" to "Absent Without Leave" effective April 16, 2013.  Subsequently, a May 2013 DA Form 4187 (Personnel Action) that changes the Veteran's duty status from "Absent Without Leave" to "Dropped From Rolls" effective May 18, 2013.  A May 2013 DD Form 458 (Charge Sheet) charges the Veteran in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) under Article 85 (Absent Without Leave) and Article 86 (Desertion), noting that the Veteran, while on Active Duty, made herself absent from her unit and did remain so; and, while on Active Duty, deserted her unit.

The Veteran's personnel records do not contain any additional information subsequent to the above event(s) and it appears that the May 2013 DD Form 458 (Charge Sheet) remains.

The Board notes that the most recent report from the VA/Department of Defense Identity Repository (VADIR).  The VADIR database is an electronic repository of military personnel's military history, payroll information and their dependents' data provided to VA by the Department of Defense's Manpower Data Center (DMDC) using the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).  The Department of Defense is the owner of all data within VADIR.  The name, birthdate, and social security number match the name, birthdate, and social security number provided by the Veteran in her claim form, and on previous claim forms.  The February 2023 VADIR report reflects that the Veteran had qualifying active-duty service with an honorable discharge (absence of a negative report) in the United States Army Reserve.  However, as noted above, there is information in the record that establishes a negative report and it is unclear if the Absent Without Leave or the Desertion charge has been resolved, or if the Veteran has even been discharged.

Although within the Veteran's February 2023 VA Form 22-1990 (Application for VA Education Benefits) reflects that the Veteran reported that she entered active duty on September 4, 2008 and separated on May 18, 2013, the evidence noted above disputes the information provided by the Veteran within her February 2023 VA Form 22-1990 (Application for VA Education Benefits).

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2023 (according to the Veteran) and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  However, the Board notes that the record does not contain the notification of the denial and is unable to confirm the date of the initial decision.

In the July 2023 VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  See July 2023 VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), Part II.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for entitlement to education benefits, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to eligibility for education benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 1606 (Selected Reserve GI Bill also known as the Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve or MGIB - SR) is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to education benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 1606 (Selected Reserve GI Bill also known as the Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve or MGIB - SR).

The Veteran's record appears that it may be incomplete.  For example, the Board notes that the record does not contain a (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) for the period of active duty from July 2011 to September 2011, or if she did not actually go on active duty at that time.  Furthermore, as noted above, there are no updates to her military service since the notification of her Desertion determination from her unit, although the Veteran asserts (through her February 2023 application) that she was discharged in May 2013.  See February 2023 VA Form 22-1990 (Application for VA Education Benefits).

Finally, the Board notes that with the Veteran's application for benefits under Chapter 1606, the claim was denied on the basis of the Veteran's service was not considered honorable and a denial letter was produced.  However, the disallowance letter is not included within the file, the current record is insufficient to support that finding, and remand is warranted to obtain a copy of the disallowance letter, if it is available.

Many questions remain that need to be answered before adjudication is possible, including (a) is the Veteran currently on active duty; (b) is the Veteran's current military status as a Deserter; (c) if the Veteran was discharged following her recorded desertion, what is the character of her discharge?

For the above reasons, remand is required to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error(s) noted above.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the Veteran's complete service personnel records and service treatment records, to include all documents pertaining to service in the United States Army Reserve.  Verify all active duty for training and inactive duty training dates for alleged service in the United States Army Reserve from 2009 to present.

If necessary, a request should be made to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).  Document all requests for information as well as all responses in the claims file.

Attempt to verify if the Veteran has been discharged or is currently determined to be on active duty in an Absent Without Leave or Desertion status noted in the May 2013 DD Form 458 (Charge Sheet).

If the Veteran has been discharged, the DD-214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) should be obtained and a determination of her character of discharge is required.

If there are any court or administrative records pertaining to the Charging document(s), those documents shall also be obtained.

If any records are determined to be unavailable, a formal finding of unavailability must be made and documented in the file.

2. Obtain the Veteran's federal records from Department of Veterans Affairs, specifically any determination letter(s) from February 2023 that denied the Veteran's claim(s) for education benefits.  Document all requests for information as well as all responses in the claims file.  

If a copy of the February 2023 determination letter is unavailable, the AOJ should provide a response indicating the reason(s) for the denial based on the indicated code(s).
