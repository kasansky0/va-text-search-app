CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected right knee tendonitis with degenerative arthritis are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for service-connected persistent depressive disorder are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

3. The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for entitlement to a TDIU are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1989 to October 2005.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from September 2022 and January 2023 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In an April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  

While his hearing was pending, however, the record reflects that the Veteran has withdrawn his appeal. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative.  Id.  

An oral withdrawal of an appeal, such as one made at a hearing, must be (1) explicit, (2) unambiguous, and (3) done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011); see Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the Board must address all three prongs of the DeLisio standard when it applies).  

The Delisio standard does not apply to written withdrawals, however.  A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1). 

In the present case, the Veteran's authorized representative, in an October 4, 2024 statement that included the Veteran's name and claims file number, withdrew "any and all outstanding appeals."  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and the above issues on appeal are dismissed.
