REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of ambulance transportation services provided by City of Sunrise Fire Rescue on December 20, 2024, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

In a January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of payment or reimbursement of ambulance transportation services provided by City of Sunrise Fire Rescue on December 20, 2024, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R.§ 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Veteran seeks payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred for ambulance transport by Independence Township Fire Department from a VA hospital to a non-VA private hospital.

In January 2025, the Veterans Affairs Medical Center Beneficiary Travel Department states that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) denied the Veteran's claim for reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. § 111, which applies to beneficiary travel benefits. The denial noted that the Veteran had income greater than the low-income threshold.

VA has two legal mechanisms through which it may pay for medical transportation: 38 U.S.C. §§ 111 and 1725. Section 111 of Title 38, United States Code, allows the Secretary to pay the actual necessary expense of travel of any person to or from a Department facility for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care. 38 U.S.C. § 111(a). Notably however, applicable regulation provides specifically that beneficiary travel expenses are provided "to help veterans... obtain care or services from VHA." 38 C.F.R. § 70.1(a). Not covered under Chapter 70 of Title 38. Code of Federal Regulations, is "payment for emergency transportation of veterans for non-service-connected conditions in non-VA facilities when the payment for transportation is covered by §§ 17.1000 through 17.1008 of this chapter, as authorized by 38 U.S.C. § 1725." 38 C.F.R. § 70.1(b).

This case involves emergency medical treatment at a non-VA facility. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, implemented at 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000-1008, provides general authority for reimbursement for the reasonable value of emergency treatment furnished in a non-VA facility to those Veterans who are active VA health-care participants (i.e., enrolled in the annual patient enrollment system and recipients of a VA hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care under such system within the last 24-month period) and who are personally liable for such non-VA treatment and not eligible for reimbursement under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1728. The law and regulations governing beneficiary travel under 38 U.S.C. § 111 explicitly do "not cover payment for emergency transportation of veterans for non-service-connected conditions in non-VA facilities when the payment for transportation is covered by §§ 17.1000 through 17.1008 of this chapter, as authorized by 38 U.S.C.§ 1725." 38 C.F.R. § 70.1.

Payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for ambulance services, including air ambulance services, may be made for transporting a veteran to a facility where payment or reimbursement is authorized under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for emergency treatment provided at a non-VA facility, or payment or reimbursement would have been authorized under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for emergency treatment had the veteran's personal liability for the emergency treatment not been fully extinguished by payment by a third party, including under a health-plan contract, where the veteran: is financially liable to the provider of the emergency transportation; does not have coverage under a health-plan contract that would fully extinguish the medical liability for the emergency transportation; has no contractual or legal recourse against a third party that could reasonably be pursued for the purpose of fully extinguishing the veteran's liability to the provider; and is not eligible for reimbursement for any emergency treatment expenses under 38 U.S.C. § 1728. 38 C.F.R. § 17.1003.

VA amended 38 C.F.R. § 17.1003(a)(1), effective April 24, 2023, to clarify that payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for ambulance services for emergency treatment may be made where payment or reimbursement is authorized under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for emergency treatment provided at a non-VA facility, or payment or reimbursement would have been authorized under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for emergency treatment had the "veteran's personal liability for the emergency treatment not been fully extinguished by payment by a third party, including under a health-plan contract, or by VA." VA noted that the rule was amended to make 38 C.F.R. § 17.1003 consistent with VA's interpretation that the emergency transportation is part of the claim for emergency treatment. The rule notes that "VA amended § 17.1003 to ensure that payment or reimbursement for emergency transportation would not be prohibited on the sole basis that the emergency treatment claim was fully extinguished." The phrase "or by VA" was added to § 17.1003(a)(1) to "ensure that, consistent with the interpretation discussed above, VA can pay or reimburse for emergency transportation under section 1725 even if VA extinguishes the liability for the underlying emergency treatment using a different authority, such as under VA's Community Care Program at 38 C.F.R.§ 17.4020(c). See 88 Fed. Reg. 10,835, 10,840-41 (Feb. 22, 2023).

In this case, the VA treatment record associated with the file notes that the Veteran was seen at Broward County VA with an elevated blood pressure after a fall at home. Notes indicate paramedics arrived and transferred him to Broward General.

In this case, the VHA did not properly consider the Veteran's claim under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1725 in the January 2025 decision. As the VHA did not properly develop and consider the Veteran's reimbursement claim under the applicable law and regulations, the evidence of record at the time of the January 2025 decision did not include sufficient information to determine whether the criteria of 38 U.S.C. § 1725 are met, including the private treatment records from the emergency treatment, the ambulance records, and information about whether the Veteran was enrolled in VA healthcare or had third-party insurance such as Medicare. In other words, a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error has been committed.

As a correction of these errors by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in satisfying its regulatory and statutory duties would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the medical reimbursement claim on appeal, the appeal must be remanded for the AOJ to associate relevant records with the file, adjudicate the Veteran's claim under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1725, and provide appropriate notice of the decision under 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b) to the Veteran and his representative. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain and associate all pertinent evidence with the claims file, to include the ambulance treatment records, private treatment records, and information about the Veteran's insurance from December 20, 2024.

2. Adjudicate the claim of entitlement to reimbursement of ambulance expenses from December 20, 2024, under all applicable regulations, including 38 U.S.C. § 111, 38 U.S.C. § 1725, and 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000-1008.

3. Issue the Veteran and his representative a notice of decision on the issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of ambulance transportation on December 20, 2024, as described in 38 U.S.C. § 5104.

The notice shall include but is not limited to: a summary of the evidence; a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; identification of findings favorable to the claimant; and identification of the substantive conditions not satisfied but necessary for payment of the cost of ambulance transportation under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and 38 C.F.R. § 17.1002.
