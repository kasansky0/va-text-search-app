DOCKET NO. 231221-402947
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea had its onset in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 2001 to July 2005 and from July 2006 to May 2007, including service in the Persian Gulf.   

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran and his spouse presented sworn testimony at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in April 2025.  At the proceeding the Veteran waived the 90-day period following the appeal during which to submit additional evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 20.3000(b).  As such, the Board will proceed to adjudicate this appeal.

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

The Veteran seeks service connection for sleep apnea, which he contends began in service and has been recurrent since that time.

To establish service connection for a claimed disorder, the following criteria must be met: (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and current disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also, Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting in a disease or injury that is incurred in or aggravated by active-duty military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection may be established by credible lay evidence and medical evidence provided by the Veteran or otherwise. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

During the April 2025 hearing, the Veteran testified to having sleep issues in and since service, to include heavy snoring, feeling unrested, and daytime fatigue.  He stated that some of his buddies in service told him that he snored and during his second tour, he was told he "rattled the windows" with his snoring.  The Veteran's spouse testified that she met the Veteran shortly after service in July 2007.  She testified that his snoring was bad at that time and sounded like a "train was coming through."  The Veteran testified that his symptoms continued after service although he was not diagnosed until 2021.  He stated that he was not tested for sleep apnea prior to 2021 because his doctors though that his symptoms were due to his PTSD.  

Additionally, the VA examination reports of record reflects that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of sleep apnea.  VA Examination Report, October 2023 and December 2023; See also Sleep Study, February 2022.  

The Veteran is competent to report the onset and continuation of his sleep apnea symptoms, and the Board finds his testimony credible.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran's statements are entitled to probative weight, as they are internally consistent and consistent with other evidence of record, to include his wife's testimony, showing that the Veteran has had sleep apnea symptoms in and since service.

Here, in light of the competent and credible lay evidence of the Veteran, the Board finds that the disease process of the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea became manifest while he was on active duty.  Further, the evidence shows that he has been diagnosed as having this disability.

The Board acknowledges that the October and December 2023 VA examiner's opined that the Veteran's current sleep apnea is not related to his military service.  However, these opinions carry no probative weight as they appear to have impermissibly ignored the Veteran's competent, credible reports of sleep apnea symptoms beginning in service.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249 (2020).

After resolving any doubt in the Veteran's benefit, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the disability became manifest while the Veteran was on active duty and thus was incurred in service.  See Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces).
