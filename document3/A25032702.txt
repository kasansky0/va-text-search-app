REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, to include as due to contaminated water at Camp LeJeune, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from July 1971 to April 1981, and from January 1987 to August 1991. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim for service connection for pulmonary fibrosis that was most recently addressed in an April 2023 rating decision. The December 2023 supplemental claim decision on appeal found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to service connection for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, to include as due to contaminated water at Camp LeJeune, is remanded.

This issue is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the decision on appeal. The Board must remand an appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A if the error occurred prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. VA's duty to assist includes providing a medical examination and/or opinion when necessary to make a decision on a claim. See 38 C.F.R. 3.156(c). Where VA provides the veteran with an examination or opinion, there is also a duty to ensure the examination is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). A medical opinion must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008). A medical opinion or conclusion is not adequate when the examiner fails to address relevant evidence. Id. 

In this case, VA secured a medical opinion in November 2023, however it is not adequate. The examiner opined that the diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was not etiologically related to the Veteran's period of service, to include as due to his conceded in-service toxic exposure risk activity at Camp LeJeune. The examiner stated that they considered the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effects of all toxic exposure risk activities, and specifically noted the Veteran was exposed to trichloroethylene. The examiner then stated that although there was evidence linking exposure to contaminated water at Camp LeJeune to certain health issues, "direct causation with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is not definitively established." That rationale is overly conclusory and does not discuss any of the relevant medical principles involved to allow the Board to reach an informed decision. Further, the Veteran directly submitted medical literature in January 2023 that discusses an association between exposure to trichloroethylene and the development of pulmonary fibrosis. The examiner's opinion is also inadequate because the examiner failed to address that medical literature when providing their opinion. Because the AOJ failed to secure an adequate medical opinion prior to issuing the decision on appeal, remand is necessary to correct this error. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician on the etiology of the Veteran's claimed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. If an examination is deemed necessary to respond to the question posed, one should be scheduled. The clinician is asked to address the following after reviewing the claims file:

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that there is a nexus between the Veteran's idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and his TERA, specifically his exposures at Camp LeJeune? Please explain why or why not, specifically considering 1) the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran; 2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran; and 3) the medical literature submitted by the Veteran in January 2023 indicating an association between trichloroethylene and pulmonary fibrosis.
