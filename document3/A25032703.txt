ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

There was a procedural defect on the Veteran's July 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), which contested the May 2022 rating decision denying service connection for sleep apnea, as the Veteran did not file a VA Form 10182 NOD within one year of receiving notice of the May 17, 2022, rating decision.    

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1982 to August 2018.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and elected the Direct Review docket.

The Veteran is seeking to appeal a service connection claim for sleep apnea, which was most recently denied in a May 2022 decision.  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that there was a procedural defect involving the claims-processing rules in the filing of the Veteran's July 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), and that it was thus improperly docketed.

Procedurally, the AOJ most recently denied the claim for sleep apnea in a May 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran did not timely file a request for review of this decision.  On the Veteran's July 2023 VA Form 10182, he listed sleep apnea with a rating decision date of December 29, 2022. However, a review of the Veteran's claims file does not show any rating decisions regarding a sleep apnea condition from December 2022.  Rather, the record shows that the RO issued a rating decision regarding the Veteran's sleep apnea condition on May 17, 2022.     

In order for the Board to have jurisdiction of an AMA appeal, a VA Form 10182 NOD must be properly filed within one year of the date of the letter notifying the Veteran of the decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.203.

To that end, a NOD must be filed within one year of the issuance of notice of the decision of the AOJ.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A).  This law is a mandatory claims-processing rule.  See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (en banc) (considering the same section of the pre-amended "legacy" version of the statute). When an application for review is not in conformity with the timeliness requirement, it shall not be entertained.  38 U.S.C. § 7108.  An exception exists if a claimant establishes "an adequate excuse" for the NOD's untimeliness, such as an extension request with good cause, waiver, forfeiture, or any other relevant factor. See Ferko, 37 Vet. App. 262; Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333-34 (2021). An extension of the time limit may be granted after expiration of a time limit where the claimant presents good cause for why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was.  38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).

Here, notice of the adverse AOJ decision underlying the Veteran's sleep apnea condition was sent on May 17, 2022.  The Veteran's 10182 NOD regarding sleep apnea was received on July 2, 2023, more than one year later.  Additionally, in a January 2025 letter, the Board informed the Veteran that the July 2023 10182 was invalid because it was not received within the time allowed by law.  The letter also notified the Veteran that if he disagreed with the Board's determination, he had 60 days from the date of the letter to respond and if he did not file a timely response, the Board will dismiss his appeal and will consider this matter closed.  However, no response was received from the Veteran.  The Board finds that there was a procedural defect in the filing of the Veteran's appeal, and it must be dismissed due to that procedural defect.  

Furthermore, the Board notes that no adequate excuse has been provided in this case.  While an extension of the time limit may be granted when good cause is presented, the Veteran has not submitted a request for an extension of the time limit, either formally or informally. 

Additionally, the mandatory claims-processing rule for a timely NOD has not been waived.  The only action taken by the Board that could be argued in support of waiver is the Board's July 8, 2023, docketing letter in which it told the Veteran it had "received [his] Board appeal request (VA Form 10182) [and his] appeal has been placed on the Direct Review docket."  This ministerial letter did not constitute waiver of enforcement of the mandatory claims-processing rule because the content or the letter makes clear it was simply acknowledging that the Board had received the Veteran's request for Board review and that this request would be reviewed.  Additionally, the letter was prepared and signed by the Board's Inbound Operations Branch, an administrative team, rather than by a Board member or any other Board official with the appearance of authority to make decisions regarding application of law to facts.  Last, "[a] question as to timeliness of the notice of disagreement shall be decided by the Board," pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C), and the letter contained neither a discussion of the facts of the Veteran's case nor application of the relevant statutes and regulations such that it could be construed as a Board decision about the timeliness of the Veteran's NOD.  Indeed, nothing in the letter purported to be a decision about the Veteran's case.

Moreover, enforcement of the mandatory claims-processing rule for a timely NOD has not been forfeited.  This is the first opportunity that the Board has had to review the July 2, 2023, 10182 NOD, so it could not have taken any action construable as forfeiting the enforcement of the claims-processing rule.

Finally, there is no indication that any other factor weighs in favor of finding that there has been a waiver or forfeiture by VA of the one-year claims-processing rule.

Therefore, as no VA Form 10182 NOD was filed with regard to the sleep apnea condition within one year of the May 17, 2022, rating decision, and no adequate excuse is established for the lack of timeliness, the appeal of this issue must be dismissed for failure to follow the mandatory claims-processing rule requiring a timely NOD.  However, if the Veteran has new and relevant evidence to support this claim, he is encouraged to file a supplemental claim with the RO.

As such, the Veteran's VA Form 10182 NOD is untimely and constitutes a procedural defect.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  Accordingly, there is no case or controversy before the Board, which is authorized to dismiss any appeal that fails to allege an error of fact or law.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5).  Therefore, this matter is dismissed.
