ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for otitis media is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record does not indicate a current diagnosis or disability of otitis media.

2. The evidence of record does not indicate an in-service event, treatment, or diagnosis of hypertension.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for otitis media have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1987 to October 1991. The Veteran died in March 2022 and the Appellant is his surviving spouse.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2019 rating decision issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In August 2019, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, electing the Hearing docket. The Veteran died during the pendency of this appeal and the Appellant's request for substitution was granted in July 2023. On June 17, 2024, the Appellant withdrew the hearing request.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2019 rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant or her representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Legal Criteria

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that an injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in active military service or, if preexisting, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). 

Generally, to establish service connection, there must be evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. See, e.g., Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (the claimant is entitled to the benefit-of-the-doubt when competing evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal"; exact equipoise is not required to trigger the favorable benefit-of-the-doubt rule).

1. Entitlement to service connection for otitis media

In the April 2019 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding of in-service treatment of otitis media. Thus, the second element of service connection is satisfied.

The Board, however, does not find sufficient evidence of a current disability to satisfy the first element of service connection.

The Veteran was provided a VA examination in March 2019. The examiner did not note a diagnosis of otitis media, but instead noted a diagnosis of normal ears. The Veteran reported a constant buzz in his ears since separation from service but denied any recurrent history of ear infections. He stated that he has had an occasional earache but denied other problems that required treatment. Other than constant ringing, the Veteran denied other current symptoms. Upon examination, the examiner noted a large amount of earwax, but no other pertinent findings. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's in-service otitis media was an acute condition, with no evidence of chronicity of care, and that a nexus has not been established.

VA treatment records list otitis media in the Veteran's medical history problem list, but do not indicate any treatment for the condition. See VA treatment records ranging from January 2000 to May 2018.

The Board finds that the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis or disability of otitis media and was not exhibiting any symptoms or residuals at the time he filed his claim for service connection.  While the Veteran's VA treatment note otitis media in the problem list, the Board places greater weight on the findings of the March 2019 examiner.  The VA treatment records do not include any treatment for otitis media.  Further, the March 2019 examiner conducted a physical examination of the Veteran and review his claims file before finding that otitis media was not currently manifest.  

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997). Without a current disability, service connection cannot be granted. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303; Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1995) (Congress specifically limited entitlement to service connection for a disease or injury to cases where such incidents had resulted in a disability). Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for otitis media must be denied. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) showed the following blood pressure readings: 150/90 (October 1987 Report of Medical Examination; 134/68 (December 16, 1987); 137/84 (March 25, 1988); 126/76 (April 4, 1988); 154/88 (April 5, 1988); 124/78 (August 22, 1988); 126/82 (September 2, 1988); 120/76 (September 22, 1988); 118/78 (October 3, 1988); 124/80 (August 5, 1989); 110/82 (February 28, 1990); 128/80 (August 23, 1990); 128/82 (February 19, 1991); 130/90 (May 29, 1991); and 122/74 (October 1991 Report of Medical Examination). 

VA treatment records indicate an impression of hypertension with an initial blood pressure reading of 140/96 and a repeat blood pressure reading of 132/83. See October 2005 VA treatment records. 

Private treatment records also indicate a diagnosis of hypertension as of at least February 2017. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility received April 2018. 

In March 2019, the Veteran was provided a VA examination. The examiner noted a 2005 diagnosis of hypertension. The Veteran reported that he began taking blood pressure medication in the early 1990s and had multiple adjustments in medications since then. The blood pressure readings noted in the examination were: 163/93 and 140/90 (November 15, 2016); 136/93 and 141/96 (March 23, 2019); 142/93 and 139/90 (March 25, 2019); and 142/94, 140/90, and 142/88 (March 26, 2019). 

The examiner opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's hypertension was incurred in or caused by service. The examiner explained that while the Veteran "has documentation of isolated elevated blood pressure readings during service, these findings were not consistent or sufficient for a diagnosis of hypertension. He had mostly normal BP readings during service and did not receive a diagnosis of or treatment for hypertension during service. Further, the Veteran's BP on his entrance exam was elevated at 150/90, revealing that isolated incidents of BP elevation were noted even prior to service. Diagnosis of hypertension requires persistently elevated blood pressure readings and isolated elevations may occur in response to acute conditions such as stress, injury, or illness. The Veteran's BP on separation exam was 122/74, which is [within normal limits] without treatment." See March 2019 VA examination. 

The Board finds that the Veteran had a diagnosis of hypertension, satisfying the first element of service connection. 

The evidence of record, however, does not indicate an in-service diagnosis, treatment, or indication of hypertension. As the March 2019 VA examiner noted, the Veteran did have one elevated blood pressure reading during his entry examination, but the remainder of his blood pressure readings during service were largely normal. 

Because the evidence of record does not indicate that the Veteran experienced hypertension during service, within the one-year presumptive period, or continually since separation from service, the second element of service connection, an in-service event, injury, or disease, is not satisfied.  Accordingly, the claim of service connection for hypertension must be denied.
