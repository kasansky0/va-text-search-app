ORDER

Service connection for chronic kidney disease (kidney disorder), to include as secondary to toxic herbicide exposure, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's kidney disorder was not caused by or related to active-duty service, to include exposure to toxic herbicide.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a kidney disorder, to include as secondary to toxic herbicide exposure, have not been met. 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131, 5103(a), 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1973 to June 1977.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2024 issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In his September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Service Connection

Under the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (a), 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310. Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 505 (1995).

In some cases, a relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service may be established through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology for certain specific chronic disorders including hypertension. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). Continuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was "noted" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology. Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-96 (1997).

Moreover, even if a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, evidence of continuous symptoms since active duty is still a factor for consideration as to whether a causal relationship exists between an in-service injury or incident and the current disorder as is contemplated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Additionally, VA regulations state that a veteran who served in the Republic of Vietnam and other Asian locations during the period from January 9, 1962, to May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to certain herbicide agents for the purpose of establishing service connection based upon exposure to toxic herbicide agents during active military service (subject to the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)). See 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e).  If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service, service connection is presumed for certain disorder. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a kidney disorder

The Veteran asserts that his chronic kidney disease is related to active-duty service.  Specifically, he contends that his exposure to toxic herbicide caused his kidney disorder. 

As an initial matter, although the evidence reflects that the Veteran served in Thailand and is therefore presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents, however, service connection is not warranted on a presumptive basis, as his disorder is not listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

Next, notwithstanding the presumption, service connection for a disability claimed as due to exposure to Agent Orange may be established by showing that a disorder resulting in disability was in fact causally linked to such exposure. See Brock v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 155, 162-64 (1997); Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1044 (Fed. Cir. 1994), citing 38 U.S.C. § 1113 (b) and 1116 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted for the Veteran's kidney disorder. First, the Veteran's service treatment records do not reflect complaints of, continuous treatment for or a diagnosis of a kidney disorder during active-duty service. In fact, the Veteran's June 1977 separation examination and report of medical history were negative for these conditions or symptoms related thereto.

Moreover, the post-service evidence does not reflect symptoms of this disorder until many years after separation. He did not have any signs or symptoms in the clinical evidence until approximately 2021. Indeed, the Veteran himself has not asserted that he has experienced kidney issues since service.  Therefore, continuous symptoms has not been shown.

Next, the evidence also does not indicate that the Veteran's kidney disease is otherwise related to active-duty service.  Specifically, the Board relies on the medical opinions provided in June 2024 and July 2024 where the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's kidney disorder was less likely than not related to active duty service on a direct basis because there were no symptoms in his service treatment records, and that his disorder was less likely than not related to agent orange exposure as medical evidence shows no evidence of a correlation between agent orange and chronic kidney disease.  The Board assigns these opinions significant probative weight as they were rendered by a qualified medical professional familiar with the Veteran.  Additionally, the Board notes the negative opinions are the only medical opinions of record. 

In arriving at this conclusion, the Board has also considered the statements made by the Veteran, relating his kidney disorder to his active service. The Federal Circuit has held that "[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional." Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007)).

In this case, however, the Veteran is not competent to provide testimony regarding a diagnosis and/or etiology of his kidney disorder. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377, n.4. Because these conditions are not diagnosed by unique and readily identifiable features, they do not involve a simple identification that a layperson is competent to make. Therefore, the unsubstantiated statements regarding the claimed diagnosis and etiology of the Veteran's disorder are found to lack competency.

In light of the above discussion, the Board concludes that the weight of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for a kidney disorder and there is no doubt to be otherwise resolved. 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). Therefore, the appeal is denied. The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
