REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1963 to January 1970. Unfortunately, the Veteran died in April 2001. The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 3, 2020 administrative decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the October 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Evidence Submission review lane. 

In a May 10, 2024 written correspondence, the Board notified the appellant that the Board interpreted her VA Form 10182 as a disagreement with the AOJ's September 3, 2020 administrative decision denying her claim for accrued benefits, and that if she did not agree with the Board's interpretation of the claim, she could do nothing, or submit a response by completing a VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim within 60 days. The Board also informed the Veteran that the other dates she had listed in the VA Form 10182 that she wished to appeal were not dates that an appealable decisions was issued. In that regard, the appellant indicated that she wished to appeal an October 16, 2019 decision. The Board informed her that October 16, 2019 is the date of a printout of her monthly Compensation and Pension award from January 2002 to December 2018, and is not a decision that is appealable to the Board. She also indicated that she wished to appeal a June 10, 2020 decision. The Board informed her that June 10, 2020 is the date of a Report of General Information showing that a Congressman's office contacted VA inquiring about the status of acclaim, and it is not a decision that is appealable to the Board. The Board sent a copy of the letter to the Veteran's representative. Neither the Veteran nor or her representative responded to the Board's letter, therefore, the Board interprets the appellant's VA Form 10182 as a disagreement with the AOJ's September 3, 2020 administrative decision denying compensation for accrued benefits and adjudicate those claims. 

Based on the appellant's decision to have the claims adjudicated in the evidence lane, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 3, 2020 AOJ administrative decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant, or her representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to accrued benefits for the claim of entitlement to service connection for lung cancer is remanded.

2. Entitlement to accrued benefits for the claim of entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for left ear hearing loss is remanded. 

3. Entitlement to accrued benefits for the claim of entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is remanded.

At the time of the Veteran's death in April 2001, he had pending claims for entitlement to service connection for lung cancer and for increased ratings for his left ear hearing loss and tinnitus. 

Periodic monetary benefits to which a Veteran was entitled at the time of death, under existing ratings or decisions, or based on evidence of record at the date of death (i.e., accrued benefits), and due and unpaid for a period not to exceed two years prior to the last date of entitlement, shall be paid to certain survivors, including the Veteran's surviving child, upon the Veteran's death. 38 U.S.C. § 5121; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000(c). Accrued benefits are paid to the living person first listed as follows: his or her spouse; his or her children (in equal shares); and his or her dependent parents (in equal shares) or the surviving parent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000(a)(1). An application for accrued benefits must be filed within one year after the date of a Veteran's death. 38 U.S.C. § 5121; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000(c).

On May 11, 2001, within one year of the Veteran's death in April 2001, the appellant submitted a VA Form 21-534 Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation ["DIC"], Death Pension and Accrued Benefits by a Surviving Spouse or Child (Including Death Compensation if Applicable). She answered in the affirmative that the Veteran had previous applied to the VA for benefits. 

In a June 11, 2002 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, but they did not adjudicate the appellant's claim for entitled to compensation for accrued benefits based on the claims that were pending at the time of the Veteran's death. The Board notes that prior to October 20, 2008, a formal determination regarding substitution was not required, and an appellant was automatically substituted in the place of a deceased Veteran,  providing that the appellant submitted the claim within one year of the Veteran's death, as the appellant did in this case. Therefore, when the appellant submitted her claim, she became the substitute claimant for her husband's pending claims. 

On August 28, 2020 the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim seeking compensation for accrued benefits. She claimed entitlement to accrued benefits based on the Veteran's pending claims at the time of his death. 

In the September 3, 2020 decision on appeal, the AOJ denied the appellant's August 28, 2020 claim for entitlement to accrued benefits, informing her that accrued benefits are any money VA owes the Veteran at the time of death, and that they could not approve the appellant's claim for VA benefits because VA did not owe the Veteran any money. 

Regrettably, the AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and a remand is necessary to ensure that the appellant is afforded due process, and that there is a complete record upon which to decide her claim so that she is afforded every opportunity. 38 U.S.C. § 5103; 38 C.F.R. §§  3.15938; 20.802. 

The AOJ's decision in September 3, 2020 to deny the appellant's claim for compensation for accrued benefits failed to take into account and adjudicate the prior pending claims that have not been decided in the first instance. In other words, in the September 3, 2020 decision, the AOJ did not adjudicate the claim for accrued benefits based on the claims that were pending at the time of the Veteran's death. The AOJ only considered whether VA owed the Veteran any money at the time of his death, then denied the claim. It would be fundamentally unfair to the appellant and deprive her of due process if the AOJ did not address the claims in the first instance based on the claims that were pending at time of the Veteran's death. Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993). This is colloquially known as the "two bites at the apple" rule.

Accordingly, to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty that would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim, the Board must remand the Veteran's claim for the AOJ to adjudicate the pending claims in the first instance. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). As such, a remand is necessary.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The RO must readjudicate the merits of the appellant's claim for compensation for accrued benefits based on the pending claims for entitlement to service connection for lung cancer, entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for left ear hearing loss and entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus that were pending at the time of the Veteran's death. See March 8, 2000 Form 9 showing pending claims for increased ratings for left ear hearing loss and tinnitus. See also December 20, 2000 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim which the AOJ treated as an informal claim for entitlement to service connection for lung cancer that was pending at the time of the Veteran's death. See February 14, 2001 Memorandum.
