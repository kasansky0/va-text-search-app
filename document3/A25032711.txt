ORDER

New and relevant evidence having been received, the petition to reopen the claim for compensation under 38?U.S.C. §?1151 for residuals of neck surgery is granted. 

Entitlement to compensation under 38?U.S.C. §?1151 for residuals of neck surgery is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran's Board testimony constitutes "new" evidence because it was not previously submitted to agency decision-makers. Additionally, the Board finds that the Veteran's testimony is also "relevant" because it indicates that the Veteran's symptoms are causally related to her neck surgery. 

2. The probative evidence of record weighs against finding that the Veteran's residuals of her neck surgery were proximately due to carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of the VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination, or that the proximate cause of her disability was an event not reasonably foreseeable. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria to reopen the claim for compensation under 38?U.S.C. §?1151 for residuals of neck surgery have been met.?38?U.S.C. §§?5108, 7105;?38?C.F.R. §?3.156. 

2. The criteria under the provisions of?38?U.S.C. §?1151?for compensation for residuals of neck surgery have not been met.?38?U.S.C. §?1151;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.361, 17.32.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from November 1989 to September 1992 and from December 1995 to August 1996. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2020 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing review lane. In June 2024, the Veteran testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). According to the Veteran's selection of the hearing lane under AMA, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or her representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. §20.302 (a).

1. New and relevant evidence having been received, the petition to reopen the claim for compensation under 38?U.S.C. §?1151 for residuals of neck surgery is granted. 

Legal Criteria	

Generally, a final and unappealed decision issued by the AOJ or a decision from the Board may not thereafter be readjudicated and allowed.?38?U.S.C. §§?7104?(b), 7105(c). An exception exists if?new?and?relevant?evidence is presented or obtained with respect to a claim which has been disallowed; then, VA shall readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.?38?U.S.C. §?5108. 

"New?evidence" means evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. "Relevant?evidence" means information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim and includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.?38?C.F.R. §?3.2501(a)(1). The Board notes that because the statutory definition of "relevant" does not require that the evidence relate to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim, or raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim, "new?and?relevant" evidence is a lower standard than the former "new?and material" evidence standard. 

Factual Background

In October 2019, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim ( VA Form 20-0995 ) seeking compensation under 38?U.S.C. §?1151 for residuals of neck surgery.

In March 2020, the RO issued a rating decision which concluded that new and relevant evidence had not been received to reopen the Veteran's claim seeking compensation under 38?U.S.C. §?1151 for residuals of neck surgery.

In June 2024, the Veteran testified that she underwent a spinal surgery that should have only lasted a day but that she remained in the intensive care unit (ICU) for three weeks. The Veteran explained that she subsequently developed symptoms of numbness and issues with using the restroom. The Veteran also explained that she is a fall risk and that it feels like her body is in rigor mortis. 

Analysis

The Veteran's testimony constitutes "new" evidence because it was not previously submitted to agency decision-makers. 

Additionally, the Board finds that the Veteran's testimony is also "relevant" because it indicates that her symptoms are causally related to her neck surgery. 

Accordingly, the evidence is new and relevant, and thus, re-adjudication of the claim is warranted. 

2. Entitlement to compensation under 38?U.S.C. §?1151 for residuals of neck surgery is denied. 

Legal Criteria

A veteran disabled as a result of VA medical treatment may receive compensation for a qualifying additional disability in the same manner as if such additional disability were service-connected.?38?U.S.C. §?1151. An additional disability is a qualifying disability if: (1) it was not the result of the veteran's willful misconduct; (2) the disability was caused by VA hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination furnished the veteran under any law administered by the VA; and, (3) the proximate cause of the disability was carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of the VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination, or the proximate cause of the disability was an event not reasonably foreseeable.?38?U.S.C. §?1151?(a).	  

Factual Background

The Veteran states that she developed symptoms of limited range of motion of the neck, urinary and bowel problems, menstrual issues, and numbness in the spine, pelvis, torso, rectal area, and hips following a neck surgery at a VA medical center (VAMC) in July 2014.

The Veteran was afforded a November 2015 VA examination for the residuals of her neck condition. The conducting physician indicated that a review of July 2014 medical records confirms that the Veteran underwent intramedullary surgery to resect a spinal cord tumor. They further explained that VA surgical notes indicate the procedure was performed without complications, with a smooth postoperative recovery initially documented. 

The physician indicated that follow-up records note the Veteran's report of partial sensory loss below the mid-thoracic level, including numbness in the mid-center thoracic region extending to the inner thighs, although bowel and bladder function remained intact. The physician indicated that the February 2015 VA neurosurgery notes document gradual improvement in sensory deficits and coordination, with ongoing but incomplete recovery below the surgical site. 

The VA physician explained that it is more likely than not that the Veteran's disability, including the sensory loss and coordination issues were causally related to the spinal tumor surgery. As a rationale, the VA physician explained that sensory loss and gait disturbances are recognized risks of spinal tumor resection, even with optimal surgical technique, and such deficits often improve over time. 

Next, the VA physician opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's condition resulted from carelessness, negligence, lack of skill, or a similar instance of fault on the part of the attending VA personnel. As a rationale, the physician explained that no evidence of surgical error, negligence, or substandard care was identified in the operative or immediate postoperative records. As such, the physician attributed the disability to the treatment's inherent risks rather than the provider's fault. 

The VA physician further opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's neck surgery residuals resulted from an unforeseeable event or error that a reasonable healthcare provider could not have anticipated during this treatment. As a rationale, the physician explained that the procedure and immediate postoperative recovery were uneventful, with no unexpected intraoperative events documented. The physician further explained that while complications can arise even in optimally performed surgeries, no deviations from standard care or unforeseen incidents were recorded. 

Finally, the VA physician opined that it was less likely than not that any failure by VA providers to diagnose or treat the Veteran's condition contributed to disease progression or additional disability. As a rationale, the physician noted that pre-surgical records showed no evidence of delays in diagnosis or treatment. The physician noted that the procedure was scheduled promptly after imaging confirmed spinal cord compression, adhering to standard care protocols. The physician concluded that care was timely and appropriate, with no documented medical decision-making or treatment delivery lapses. 

The Veteran testified at the Board hearing that she underwent a spinal surgery that should have only lasted a day but that she remained in the ICU for three weeks. The Veteran reported being informed of a "leakage" related to her condition and expressed a desire to review imaging of what she understood to be a cyst. Medical records clarified that the lesion, initially described as cystic, was surgically confirmed to be a tumor. The Veteran explained that following the surgery, she developed symptoms of numbness and issues with using the restroom. The Veteran also explained that she is a fall risk and that it feels like her body is in rigor mortis.

Analysis

The first issue is whether the Veteran is claiming an additional disability that did not exist prior to the July 2014 spinal surgery. Here, the record reflects that the Veteran has partial sensory loss below the mid-thoracic level, including numbness in the mid-center thoracic region extending to the inner thighs. Accordingly, the first element of 38?U.S.C. §?1151?(a) has been met. 

The second issue is whether the Veteran's residuals of her neck surgery was caused by VA hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination furnished the veteran under any law administered by the VA. Here, the Board notes that the Veteran's spinal surgery was performed at a VAMC. Additionally, the Board assigns probative value to the November 2015 VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran's sensory loss and coordination issues were causally related to the spinal tumor surgery. Accordingly, the second element of 38?U.S.C. §?1151?(a) has been met.

The final issue is whether the proximate cause of the Veteran's disability was carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of the VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination, or the proximate cause of the disability was an event not reasonably foreseeable. 

Here, the Board assigns probative value to the November 2015 VA examiner's opinion that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's condition resulted from carelessness, negligence, lack of skill, or a similar instance of fault on the part of the attending VA personnel. The Board also assigns probative value to the November 2015 VA examiner's opinion that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's neck surgery residuals resulted from an unforeseeable event or error that a reasonable healthcare provider could not have anticipated during this treatment. The Board notes that the conducting examiner is a Doctor of Medicine who supported their opinion with a rationale.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report on symptoms following the neck surgery. However, the specific issue in this case-whether the VA care providers were negligent in performing the Veteran's surgery and whether the claimed disability resulted from an unforeseeable event-is outside the Veteran's common knowledge as a layperson. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

As such, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record weighs against finding that the Veteran's residuals of her neck surgery was proximately due to carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of the VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination, or that the proximate cause of her disability was an event not reasonably foreseeable. 

Accordingly, her claim must be denied.
