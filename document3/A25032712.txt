FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran did not timely file a VA Form 10182 and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board of Veterans' Appeals to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182 with respect to the rating decision issued on November 30, 2021.

2. The Veteran did not timely file a VA Form 10182 and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board of Veterans' Appeals to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182 with respect to the rating decision issued on November 30, 2021.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an extension of the period for filing a VA Form 10182 with respect to the rating decision issued on November 30, 2021 are not met and the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was not otherwise timely received.  38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 19.52, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1995 to April 2004.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), from November 2021 (left knee and sciatic nerve) and December 2023 (right knee) rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2021 (left knee and sciatic nerve) and December 2023 (right knee) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim of an increased rating for the right knee, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Under the AMA, if a duty to assist error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal, the appeal must be remanded to the AOJ for correction of the error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  In this case, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error was made regarding the claim for an increased rating for the right knee because the RO did not develop the record by requesting private treatment records.

1. Service connection for limitation of flexion, left knee is dismissed.

2. Service connection for paralysis of the sciatic nerve is dismissed.

The Board shall not entertain an application for review on appeal unless it conforms to the law.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7108.  Under the AMA framework, an appeal consists of a properly completed VA Form 10182 submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

A claimant may request an extension of the period for filing an appeal for good cause.  A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board.  Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

The Board shall decide all questions pertaining to its jurisdictional authority to review a particular case.  38 C.F.R. § 20.104 (c).

In this case, the AOJ notified the Veteran of its rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for a left knee and a back condition on December 1, 2021. On May 9, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in which she requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ under the AMA framework. The VA Form 10182 was not timely filed, as it was received over one year after the December 2021 notice of the November 2021 rating decision.

Additionally, the Board has considered whether the Veteran filed a timely request for an extension of the time limit to file an appeal.  However, the Board notes that no document was filed by the Veteran or her representative that can be construed as a timely request for such an extension.

In conclusion, the record shows that the Veteran did not file a timely appeal. Furthermore, the record does not reflect that the Veteran made a timely request for an extension of the time limit for filing her appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  There is no legal authority to permit the Board to find the Veteran's appeal timely in this case.  Accordingly, the Board is currently without jurisdiction to consider this claim, and the appeal is dismissed.

REASONS FOR REMAND

An increased rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with degenerative arthritis is remanded.

The Veteran asserts her right knee symptomatology warrants a higher disability rating.  There are no medical treatment records concerning the Veteran's right knee condition associated with the evidentiary record.  There is also no record of VA sending the Veteran a development request letter, requesting private treatment records, or notifying the Veteran of her duty to assist in developing the evidentiary record for her claim.

The Board finds the failure to obtain these records constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist omission.  Therefore, a remand is necessary to obtain complete treatment records from the Veteran's private medical providers.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain any outstanding and ongoing private treatment records relevant to the claim on appeal.  Ask the Veteran to identify all private providers of evaluations or treatment she received for her service-connected right knee condition which are not already in the record, and to submit authorizations for VA to secure complete clinical records from all private providers.

A copy of any requests sent to private treatment providers and all replies must be included in the claims file.  If any records cannot be obtained after reasonable efforts have been made, issue a formal determination that such records do not exist or that further efforts to obtain such records would be futile, which should be documented in the claims file.

2. Next, the AOJ should review all newly obtained private treatment records regarding the Veteran's service-connected right knee condition and readjudicate the claim for an increased rating on the merits in the first instance.
