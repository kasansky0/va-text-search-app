REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 7, 2021, for the award of service connection for a lumbosacral strain is remanded.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 7, 2021, for the award of service connection for a right knee strain is remanded.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably from September 1985 to September 2009.

In the August 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's claims for an earlier effective date for his lumbosacral strain and a right knee strain, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 7, 2021, for the award of service connection for a lumbosacral strain is remanded.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 7, 2021, for the award of service connection for a right knee strain is remanded.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for his lumbosacral strain and right knee strain. 

By way of background, in an April 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for a lumbosacral strain and a right knee strain effective April 7, 2021, the date of his VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.  On May 18, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the April 2021 decision. Specifically, the Veteran sought an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for his lumbosacral strain and right knee strain.  In the July 2021 decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that effective dates prior to April 7, 2021, were not warranted as the Veteran had not demonstrated clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the effective date assignments.     

Initially, the Board notes that the July 2021 rating decision indicated that the decision was issued in response to "a new claim for benefits that was received on July 18, 2021."  July 29, 2021, Rating Decision; see also July 29, 2021, Rating Code Sheet; July 23, 2021, Notification Letter ("Thank you for submitting an application for VA benefits, which we received July 18, 2021.").  However, the Board notes that there is no document in the record before the Board dated July 18, 2021, let alone a "new claim for benefits."  Moreover, to the extent that the AOJ intended to respond to the Veteran's May 18, 2021, HLR request, July the rating decision on appeal is erroneous for two distinct reasons.  

First, the July 2021 rating decision did not conduct HLR in its decision pursuant to the regulations governing such requests.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 5104B; C.F.R. § 3.2601.  At a minimum, the decision on appeal was not in accordance with 38 U.S.C. § 5104, which governs AOJ decisions and notifications of such decisions.  

Second, while, as noted above, the record does not contain a July 18, 2021, claim for benefits, to the extent that the AOJ construed the Veteran's May 18, 2021, HLR request as a motion to reverse or revise the April 2021 rating decision on the basis of CUE, the AOJ erred.  This is so because the April 2021 rating decision was not a final decision.  Rather, that decision was the subject of the May 18, 2021, HLR request and so it could not, as a matter of law, constitute a CUE motion.  

It is well settled that a claim that is still pending review is not a final decision that can be subject to CUE.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1) (providing that "[a]t any time after a decision is final, the claimant may request, or VA may initiate, review of the decision to determine if there was [CUE] in the decision") (emphasis added).  Stated otherwise, the Veteran can present, on direct appeal (or and HLR request as in this case), his contentions as to why he is entitled to an earlier effective date and, therefore, would not be held to the higher standard of demonstrating CUE.  See Berger v. Brown, 10 Vet.App. 166, 169 (1997) ("[T]he appellant, who always bears the burden of persuasion on appeals to [The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veteran's Claims] bears an extra-heavy burden when the appeal is a collateral attack, in the form of a CUE [motion] . . . . A final decision is entitled to a strong presumption of validity."); cf. Pederson v. McDonald, 27 Vet.App. 276, 291 (2015) (Lance J. concurring) ("It is not immediately clear why an appellant would make a knowing and voluntary litigation choice not to raise even a colorable argument on direct appeal, only to preserve the right to bring a collateral attack under a much higher standard of proof at a later date."). This would include asserting entitlement to an earlier effective date based on a prior pending claim. See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet.App. 232, 240-41 (2007).  And the Veteran did exactly that by submitting his timely May 18, 2021, HLR request in response to the April 2021 rating decision.  

The Board acknowledges that remands are limited under the Appeals Modernization Act, under which the instant appeal was taken.  However, such remands include "for correction of any other error by the [AOJ] in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim."  The AOJ's failure to adjudicate the Veteran's HLR request in the decision on appeal constitutes such error.  38 U.S.C. § 5104B; C.F.R. § 3.2601.  Thus, the Board remands this matter for such review to be conducted by the AOJ in the first instance.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) ("All questions in a matter which under section 511(a) of this title is subject to decision by the Secretary shall be subject to one review on appeal to the Secretary.").  

Finally, as noted above, to the extent that the AOJ referenced a July 18, 2021, "new claim for benefits," such document does not appear in the record before the Board.  On remand, the AOJ shall either ensure that such claim is associated with the claims file or clarify as to whether it intended to refer to the Veteran's May 18, 2021, HLR request.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c) (outlining VA's duty to assist claimants in obtaining evidence). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

(Continued on the next page)

?

1. Associate with the Veteran's claims file the July 18, 2021, "new claim for benefits" referenced in the July 2021 rating decision or clarify as to whether it was intended to refer to the Veteran's May 18, 2021, VA Form 20-0996, HLR request.  All attempts to locate this document should be documented in the record.  If it is determined that any such document is missing, a finding of unavailability should be made and associated with the claims file.

2. Issue a rating decision that properly adjudicates the Veteran's May 18, 2021, VA Form 20-0996, HLR request.
