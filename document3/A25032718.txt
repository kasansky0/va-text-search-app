DOCKET NO. 210403-207234
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for calendar year 2020 for a right shoulder brace is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the evidence reasonably indicates that the Veteran's right shoulder brace caused wear and tear to his clothing during calendar year 2020.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a clothing allowance for a right shoulder brace for calendar year 2020 have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1162 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.810 (2024).  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1981 to December 1985.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a purported May 2020 determination issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Prosthetics Department.

In his April 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal, to include the photographs submitted by the Veteran, cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  Although the Board did not provide notice to the Veteran that the additional evidence he submitted could not be considered unless he switched AMA dockets (to Evidence Submission or Hearing), the Board finds that there is no prejudice in proceeding given the favorable nature of this decision.

Entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for calendar year 2020 for a right shoulder brace

The Veteran seeks a clothing allowance for calendar year 2020, alleging that the right shoulder brace caused wear and tear to his clothing during that year. See e.g., March 2020 application for clothing allowance where the Veteran certified that his right shoulder brace tended to wear and tear his clothing.

In pertinent part, payment of an annual clothing allowance is available for each veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including a wheelchair) which VA determines tends to wear out or tear the clothing of the veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 1162.

Payment of an annual clothing allowance for a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance will be awarded when:

1. A VA examination or a hospital or examination report from a facility specified in § 3.326(b) establishes that the veteran, because of a service-connected disability or disabilities due to loss or loss of use of a hand or foot compensable at a rate specified in § 3.350(a), (b), (c), (d), or (f), wears or uses one qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) which tends to wear or tear clothing; or

2. The Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a veteran, because of a service-connected disability or disabilities, wears or uses one qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) which tends to wear or tear clothing. 

38 C.F.R. § 3.810 (a)(1).

The clothing allowance section of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Handbook includes examples of items that do not tend to wear and tear clothing that have been identified by VA prosthetics professionals. These examples include soft orthotics, elastic/flexible braces, items with Velcro stays, hinged braces covered in fabric (metal stays covered) and braces with plastic stays covered in fabric. VHA Handbook 1173.15, Section 8b (last accessed on February 13, 2025).

The evidence indicates that the Veteran wears a right shoulder brace due to his service-connected right shoulder disability. More specifically, the documentation of record indicates that he wears a DonJoy Sully right shoulder brace, with Velcro.  

Importantly, the purported May 2020 VHA decision is not part of the Veteran's VHA file, so the specific reason for the denial is unknown.  Despite the VHA Handbook noting that soft orthotics or elastic/flexible braces, and items with Velcro stays do not tend to wear and tear clothing, the Board finds the Veteran competent to report that his right shoulder brace has caused wear and tear to his clothing, as this is an observable phenomenon. In the absence of any indication that the Veteran's account is not credible, this report supports a finding that the right shoulder brace does cause such wear and tear.  The simple fact that he appealed this denial indicates the Veteran's position is that his clothing is damaged by his right shoulder brace, and there is no evidence to the contrary. 

Given the above, and resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that a clothing allowance is warranted for the 2020 calendar year for the Veteran's right shoulder brace and the appeal is granted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.810(a)(1)(ii)(A); Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1394 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
