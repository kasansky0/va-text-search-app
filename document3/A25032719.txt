ISSUE

Entitlement to individual unemployability (TDIU).

ORDER

The appeal of entitlement to individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a March 2025 statement, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal pertaining to entitlement to individual unemployability (TDIU) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1968 to January 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a June 2021 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In July 2021, the Veteran appealed this rating decision by submitting VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, selecting the Hearing docket. See July 2, 2021, VA Form 10182.  A videoconference hearing with a Veterans Law Judge was scheduled for April 1, 2025.

On March 25, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, a request to withdraw the appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals and to cancel the scheduled hearing for April 1, 2025 was received. See March 25, 2025, VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id.

Written withdrawals of an appeal are governed by the applicable regulations instead of DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011) (requiring withdrawal to be explicit, unambiguous, and done with full understanding of consequences). See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2020). 

As such, the applicable regulation is 38 C.F.R. § 20.205, which provides that unless an appeal is withdrawn on the record at a hearing, appeal withdrawals must be in writing and must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran, the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

Here, in the March 2025 correspondence bearing the Veteran's name and file number, the Veteran, through his representative, indicated that he wished to withdraw the appeal and cancel all issues before the Board of Veterans' Appeals. As the Veteran only has one appeal before the Board, this March 2025 statement is sufficient to meet the criteria for a withdrawal. See March 25, 2025, Correspondence. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that he has withdrawn this appeal pertaining to entitlement to a TDIU and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
