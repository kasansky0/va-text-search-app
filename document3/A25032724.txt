FINDING OF FACT  

The Veteran's tinnitus began during active service and has been continuous since.

CONCLUSION OF LAW  

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1132, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(b), 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION  

The Veteran had active service from November 1980 to October 1983.  

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO/AOJ).  The Veteran appealed that decision by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on August 27, 2024.  He elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, consideration may only be given to the evidence of record at the time of the August 9, 2024 decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted after the decision on appeal (i.e., after August 9, 2024), the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

However, because the Board is remanding the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  

1. Entitlement to Service Connection for Tinnitus 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Entitlement to service connection requires evidence sufficient to establish (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 505 (1995).

Certain chronic diseases, including organic diseases of the nervous system such as tinnitus, may be presumed to have been incurred during service if manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Moreover, if a disease listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is shown to be chronic in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  Id. 

However, if evidence of a chronic condition is noted during service or during the presumptive period, but the chronic condition is not "shown to be chronic, or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned," i.e., "when the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported," then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required to support a claim for disability compensation for the chronic disease.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b)).  A claimant "can benefit from continuity of symptomatology to establish service connection in the ultimate sense, but only if [the] chronic disease is one listed in § 3.309(a)."  Id. at 1337.

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  When the evidence persuasively favors against the claims of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim will be denied on its merits.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The August 2024 rating decision favorably found that the Veteran has a diagnosis of tinnitus.  The Veteran also reports that he experienced tinnitus during his active service, which he is competent to report.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). The question for the Board is therefore whether the Veteran's current tinnitus is etiologically related to his active service.  The Board concludes it is.  

In May 2012 and May 2024 statements from the Veteran, he stated that he experienced tinnitus during service and that symptoms had been continuous since service. He described being constantly around loud noise, including in duties related to "maintenance on personnel carriers, and helicopters," and that he "often times experienced ringing in both my ears from this noise exposure."  "Since military service," he reports, he "still experience[s] ringing in both ears."  

The record contains two negative nexus opinions regarding the Veteran's tinnitus. Both examiners opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by military noise exposure.  

A July 2012 VA examiner reasoned that the Veteran "does not have hearing loss" and his "tinnitus began many years after separation."  During the examination, the Veteran reported he had also periodically noticed tinnitus 7-8 years ago in very quiet environments.  In a later addendum opinion, the examiner added that, as the interval between noise exposure and tinnitus onset lengthens, the probability tinnitus will be precipitated by other factors increases.  

An August 2024 VA examiner reasoned that there was no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds beyond test variability between the Veteran's entrance and separation examinations.  The examiner stated that this was objective evidence of no auditory damage during service, and also that the Veteran had hearing loss, and his tinnitus was related to it.  The examiner stated there were no reports of tinnitus in service records, that the onset of tinnitus reported by the Veteran was years after separation, and that there was no support in literature for delayed-onset tinnitus.  

The July 2012 and August 2024 VA medical opinions are based largely on normal hearing and the absence of a threshold shift at separation from active service.  The mere fact that the Veteran had normal hearing in service does not preclude establishing a hearing-related disability post-service. More problematic, and in relation to the same, the examiners did not address the Veteran's statements that his tinnitus began during active service and persisted since.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 257 (2020).  

The Veteran is competent to report and diagnose tinnitus. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002).  He is also competent to provide his observations that he experienced symptoms of tinnitus following exposure to loud noise during service, and that he continued to experience symptoms after, even if he is not competent to opine on its cause.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Board finds the Veteran's statements regarding his tinnitus to be competent and probative evidence regarding onset of tinnitus during his active service and continuation of those symptoms after.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  His report of experiencing tinnitus in service and on a recurrent basis since that time is also found to be credible.  

Thus, after resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that continuity of symptomatology has been established.  The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus are met.  

REASONS FOR REMAND  

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  

The Veteran maintains that service connection is warranted for bilateral hearing loss.  An August 2024 rating decision favorably found that the Veteran was exposed to noise during service as a result of his infantry-related military occupational specialty.  It also favorably found that the Veteran was diagnosed with an exceptional pattern of left ear hearing loss based on puretone threshold test results from an August 2024 VA examination.  

The record includes July 2012 and August 2024 VA examination reports. Both examiners opined that it was less likely than not that bilateral hearing loss was caused by or the result of in-service noise exposure.  

The July 2012 VA examiner reasoned that the Veteran's hearing was normal at separation and there was no evidence of significant shift in thresholds from induction to discharge.  The examiner indicated that the July 2012 examination showed the Veteran's hearing was normal by VA standards. Elsewhere on the report, the examiner stated he did not have hearing loss.  

The August 2024 VA examiner diagnosed bilateral hearing loss but reasoned that, while the Veteran was exposed to noise during service, exposure to noise is not auditory damage, and auditory damage was needed to relate his current hearing loss to in-service exposure to noise. The examiner explained that there was no objective evidence of permanent auditory damage on active duty from conceded noise because there were no significant permanent shifts in hearing thresholds.  The examiner stated that service records did not show hearing complaints or treatment, that the Veteran's hearing was normal at separation, and that years later at the July 2012 VA examination his hearing was normal.

The August 2024 VA examination report shows right ear puretone thresholds were 40, 30, 30, and 35 dB.  Left ear puretone thresholds were 60, 80, 80, and 85 dB.  The examiner indicated audiologic results were "inconsistent with organic hearing loss" and "not valid for rating purposes (not indicative of organic hearing loss)."  The report instructs that a "Stenger [test] must be administered whenever puretone air conduction thresholds... differ by 20 dB or more between the two ears" and the examiner conducted two Stenger tests, both positive.  

The examiner separately noted that puretone averages and speech reception thresholds were in significant disagreement bilaterally.  Inter-test reliability was also considered poor, the examiner noted, and the Veteran's responses continued to be inconsistent after reinstruction. The examiner summarized audiologic findings on the report as "unable to obtain / maintain seal."  The examination report itself instructed that "[c]learly inaccurate, invalid, or unreliable results should not be reported."  The examiner clearly reported puretone auditory threshold test results.  

Normal hearing and the absence of a threshold shift at separation from active service does not foreclose entitlement to service connection for hearing loss. See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347, 349 (2018); see also Hensley v. Brown, 30 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993).  That the August 2024 VA examiner also noted, but did not address, the Veteran's statement that his hearing difficulties had persisted since service renders the opinion inadequate. See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 257 (2020); see also McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15, 30 (2016).  

Additionally, while the July 2012 VA examiner indicated a shift in hearing thresholds in any frequency from 500 to 4,000 Hz was significant if 15 dB or greater, the August 2024 VA examiner did not.  The premise of the August 2024 VA examiner's conclusion was thus, in part, undefined.  

When VA provides an examination, it must ensure that the examination is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). To be adequate, a medical examination report must contain clear conclusions, supporting data, and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008). It should be based upon consideration the Veteran's prior medical history, reports of symptoms, and describe the disability and symptoms in sufficient detail to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007); Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 257 (2020).  

Additionally, if a diagnosis is not supported by the findings on the examination report or if the report does not contain sufficient detail, it is incumbent upon the AOJ to return the report as inadequate for evaluation purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.

The VA examinations and opinions of record at the time of the decision on appeal were inadequate to adjudicate the claim, and are thus insufficient to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision on the matter of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. Remand is required for correction of the error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy the duty to assist under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d). 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In remanding these matters, the Board makes no credibility findings as to the lay evidence of record. Smith v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 332 (2020).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination by an appropriate clinician regarding the nature and etiology of right ear and left ear hearing loss. Audiological testing should be performed along with an interview of the Veteran and complete review of the claims file.  The examiner should provide opinions to the following:

(a)	Has the Veteran had a hearing loss disability of the left and/or right ear for VA purposes at any time during the period on appeal?  If a negative diagnosis is made, the examiner is asked to reconcile that conclusion with findings made in the August 2024 VA examination.

(b)	If a diagnosis of a left and/or right ear hearing loss disability is made, the examiner must address whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the hearing loss disability resulted from service, including exposure to noise, or that symptoms such as hearing difficulties have been continuous since separation from service.    

The examiner must fully explain the rationale for all opinions, with citation to supporting data/lay statements, as deemed appropriate, including:  

"	September 1980 and July 1983 service records showing hearing threshold shifts of 10 dB in 500 Hz frequency.  

"	July 2012 VA examination report stating the Veteran "does not have hearing loss."  

"	June 2024 VA treatment record noting hearing test results, documenting the Veteran's report that his family remarked that his voice is loud, finding hearing aids are medically indicated and that "the Veteran's hearing loss has progressed."  

"	August 2024 VA examination report documenting the Veteran's lay statements that his left ear hearing is worse and describing hearing difficulties since service.  

"	August 2024 VA examination report and VA Form 10-2364 to include notes of inconsistent results, poor reliability, positive Stenger tests, and summary of audiologic findings as "unable to obtain / maintain seal."
