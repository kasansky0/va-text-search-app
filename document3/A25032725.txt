DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

For the entire period on appeal, entitlement to an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his currently diagnosed tinnitus had its onset during military service.  

2. For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was manifested by no worse than Level I in both of his ears.   

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2.  For the entire period on appeal, the criteria for an initial compensable rating for the Veterans service-connected bilateral hearing disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107;?38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.21, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Army National Guard from August 1984 to August 1990, during which he had a confirmed period of active duty from June 1986 to July 1986.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision and by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), granting the Veteran service connection for his bilateral hearing loss disability with an evaluation of noncompensable (zero) effective May 28, 2019.  This matter also comes before the Board on appeal from a March 2024 AMA rating decision by a VA RO that denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for his tinnitus on the basis that there is no link between the Veteran's tinnitus and his service.  

In May 2024, the Veteran initiated this appeal to the Board with the filing of a Decision Review Request (VA Form 10182), requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge on the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions.? In?a May 2024 correspondence, the Board acknowledged the appeal and informed the Veteran that the appeal had been placed on the Board's direct review docket.? Therefore, in adjudicating the appeal for the disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's rating decision on appeal, here as of February 23, 2024.? 38?C.F.R. §?20.301.? Additionally, in adjudicating the appeal for the Veteran's tinnitus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's rating decision on appeal, here as of March 30, 2024.  Id.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the February 2024 and March 2024 decisions, the Board did not consider it herein.? 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. §?3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Preliminary Matter

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald,?789 F.3d 1375, 1381?(Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake,?21?Vet. App.?545, 552?(2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

Service Connection

Applicable Laws and Regulations

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Tinnitus (as an organic disease of the nervous system) is considered a "chronic" disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Therefore, the presumptive service connection provisions under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for service connection based on "chronic" symptoms in service and "continuous" symptoms since service are applicable. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  For the showing of chronic diseases in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  With chronic disease as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally, a showing of continuity of symptoms after service is required for service connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

If not manifest during service, where a veteran served continuously for 90 days or more during a period of war, or during peacetime service after December 31, 1946, and the 'chronic' disease became manifest to a degree of 10 percent within 1 year from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307.

Generally, the degree of probative value which may be attributed to a medical opinion of record takes into account such factors as its thoroughness and degree of detail, and whether there was review of the claims file.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  Also significant is whether the examiner had a sufficiently clear and well-reasoned rationale, as well as a basis in objective supporting clinical data.  See Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance, with a claimant prevailing in either event.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1395 (2021); Ortiz?v.?Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

A claimant bears the evidentiary burden to establish all elements of a service connection claim, including the nexus requirement.  Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Analysis

The claimant seeks service connection for his tinnitus, which he contends began while he was in service.  See May 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Veteran contends that he was exposed to military noise during his service as a cannon crewmember.  Id.; Form DD 214.  

The March 2024 rating decision identified the following favorable findings: 1. The Veteran has been diagnosed with tinnitus; 2. The Veteran has sufficient service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection; and 3. The Veteran's tinnitus is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to military service.  Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A; Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.?

Regarding the first element of service connection, the Veteran is currently diagnosed with tinnitus, a disability capable of lay observation and diagnosis.  See December 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002).

Regarding the second element of service connection, in-service incurrence, although the Veteran's service treatment records were negative for tinnitus, the Veteran's Form DD 214 indicates that while he was in the Army, his Military Occupation Specialty (MOS) was that of cannon crewman.  The Veteran's MOS has a high probability of exposure to military noise pursuant to the Duty MOS Noise Exposure Listing, a compilation of Department of Defense-verified lists of MOS's and their corresponding probability of hazardous noise exposure.    Moreover, the Veteran earned a Rifle m-16 Marksman Badge and a Hand Grenade Expert Badge, which also adds to his in-service noise exposure. 

The Veteran also stated that his tinnitus began in September 1984, a month after he entered service.  See December 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus DBQ.  As tinnitus is a condition that is capable of lay observation, his statement is competent, and the Board has no reason to doubt the credibility of his statement.  Accordingly, and in-service event is established.      

In December 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for tinnitus, for which three separate opinions were derived.  See December 2023 Medical Opinion DBQ; February 2024 Medical Opinion DBQ; March 2024 Medical Opinion DBQ.  

The December 2023 examiner noted that the Veteran was exposed to six years of cannon fire monthly, that his tinnitus began while he was in service in September 1984, and that the tinnitus has worsened over time.  See December 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus DBQ.  The examiner then opined that the Veteran's tinnitus is less likely than not incurred in or caused by his military service, explaining "hearing loss of unknown type existed prior to service.  Hearing loss is a known contributor to tinnitus symptoms, however the claimant has a history of hearing loss prior to enlistment."  The Board finds that the opinion is conclusory, ignored the lay statements of the Veteran regarding the onset of his tinnitus and failed to consider the effects that the military noise the Veteran was exposed to had on his tinnitus.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007) (stating that a medical opinion must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can weigh, and a mere conclusion by a medical doctor is insufficient to allow the Board to make an informed decision); Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007) (finding that an examiner impermissibly ignored the appellant's lay assertions that he had sustained a back injury in service); Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304 (stating that "The Board must be able to conclude that a medical expert has applied valid medical analysis to the significant facts of the particular case in order to reach the conclusion submitted in the medical opinion.").  

The examiner also did not adequately review the Veteran's file, as the opinion noted that the Veteran only served from June 1986 to July 1986 and this is not entirely accurate, as his service with the National Guard spanned from August 1984 to August 1990.  See Form DD 214; Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304.  For these reasons, the Board finds the December 2023 opinion regarding tinnitus inadequate to decide the claim and ultimately of no probative value. 

The second opinion rendered in February 2024 was based on the Veteran's participation in toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) pursuant to an affirmative TERA memo dated January 31, 2024.   The February 2024 examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by the Veteran's participation in TERAs, explaining, in part "[t]he veteran is claiming service connection for tinnitus.  This is based upon claimed exposure(s) to fuel, combustion byproducts, lead, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls and environmental contamination with chromium, copper, zinc, lead, and cadmium. . . . . when it comes to tinnitus this represents damage to the inner ear.  Toxic exposure can lead to damage to the inner ear and tinnitus.  This will manifest as a ringing in the ears in close proximity to the exposure, not in a delayed fashion."  The examiner went on to further explain that the Veteran's tinnitus did not have its onset during service and that the Veteran "had hearing loss at entry that progressed while in the service.  Noise is a far higher risk for developing tinnitus than an exposure and his previous DBQ indicated his tinnitus was a result of his hearing loss.  I agree with that evaluation which makes it less likely than not that his tinnitus is a result of his military exposures.  Furthermore, his tinnitus has progressed.  An exposure-based tinnitus remains stable once the offending agent is removed."  

Similarly, the February 2024 opinion, which was completed by a different examiner, relied on inaccurate service dates, and was therefore based on an inaccurate factual premise.  See Form DD 214; Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304.  The opinion is also not relevant to the issue at hand, as the Veteran is not seeking service-connection based on his participation in a TERA, but rather his military noise exposure.  See May 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ.  Lastly, the examiner incorrectly opined that the Veteran's tinnitus did not have its onset during service, when the Veteran competently stated that his tinnitus began in September 1984, a month after he entered service.  See December 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus DBQ; Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) "[a]n opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value."  The Board rejects the February 2024 opinion.  

The third and final March 2024 opinion noted that the Veteran served from June to July of 1986 and August 1990 to July 1991, which as explained above is not factually accurate, as the Veteran served in the Army National Guard from August 1984 to August 1990, and served in the Army Reserve from August 1990 to July 1991.  See Form DD 214.  Based on this factual inaccuracy, the examiner opined that since the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset in September 1984, that it predated service and therefore it is less likely than not that the Veteran's tinnitus is due to service.  See March 2024 Medical Opinion DBQ.  An opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value.  Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 461.  The examiner also failed to discuss whether the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss caused or aggravated his tinnitus.  See February 2024 Exam Request.  The Board rejects this opinion as well.  Indeed, all three medical opinions carry little to no probative value and are outweighed by the Veteran's competent and credible lay assertions regarding the onset of his tinnitus.        

On review, the Board finds highly probative the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset of his tinnitus during service and his indicating that the symptoms of the disability continued since service.  See May 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ; December 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus DBQ; May 2024 VA Form 10182.  In this regard, the Veteran has consistently stated that he first experienced ringing in his ears in service.  Additionally, the Veteran's statements that he was exposed to cannon fire monthly for six years is consistent with the circumstances of his service as a cannon crewman.  38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a).  Moreover, the record does not reflect that the Veteran was exposed to any significant noise after separation from service.  See February 2024 Medical Opinion DBQ.  The Board has no reason to doubt the credibility of the Veteran's lay statements in this regard.

Based on this body of evidence, and resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that, based on the competent and credible evidence of currently diagnosed tinnitus, in-service loud noise exposure, and continuing symptoms thereafter, service connection is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

The appeal is therefore granted.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss disability.  

Increased Rating Claim

Applicable Laws and Regulations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.? The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service.? The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.? 38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §?4.1. 

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.14.? The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability.? See Esteban, 6?Vet. App.?259, 261-62 (1994). 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.? Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.7.? After consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the veteran.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.3. 

The veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations.? See generally 38?C.F.R. §?4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589 (1991).? Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged rating" (assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts found) is required.? See Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119, 126 (1999). 

Hearing Loss

Applicable Laws and Regulations

The Veteran's hearing loss is evaluated under 38?C.F.R. §?4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.? This diagnostic code sets out the criteria for evaluating hearing impairment using puretone threshold averages and speech discrimination scores.? Numeric designations are assigned based upon a mechanical use of tables found in 38?C.F.R. §?4.85, and there is no room for subjective interpretation.? See Acevedo-Escobar v. West, 12?Vet. App.?9, 10 (1998); Lendenmann v. Principi, 3?Vet. App.?345, 349 (1992).? Examinations for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a puretone audiometry test without the use of hearing aids.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.85(a).? Speech recognition ability must be measured using the Maryland CNC word list.? Id. 

Hearing loss disability evaluations range from noncompensable (zero) to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity, as measured by controlled speech discrimination tests in conjunction with the average hearing threshold, and as measured by puretone audiometric tests in the frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second, or hertz (Hz). 

The rating criteria for hearing loss establish eleven auditory acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity, through Level XI for profound deafness.? The rows in Table VI (38?C.F.R. §?4.85) represent nine categories of the percentage of discrimination based on the controlled speech discrimination test.? The columns in Table VI represent nine categories of decibel loss based on the puretone audiometry test.? The numeric designation of impaired hearing (Levels I through XI) is determined for each ear by intersecting the row appropriate for the percentage of discrimination and the column appropriate to the puretone decibel loss.? The percentage disability evaluation is found in Table VII (38?C.F.R. §?4.85) by intersecting the row appropriate for the numeric designation for the ear having the better hearing acuity and the column appropriate to the numeric designation level for the ear having the poorer hearing acuity. 

In addition, under 38?C.F.R. §?4.86(a), when the puretone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, is 55 decibels or more, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.? Under 38?C.F.R. §?4.86(b), when the puretone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.? That numeral will then be elevated to the next higher Roman numeral. 

Analysis

The Veteran was granted service connection for his bilateral hearing loss disability in a February 2024 rating decision, and the AOJ assigned a noncompensable rating effective May 28, 2019.  The Veteran seeks a higher rating.  See May 2024 VA Form 10182.  

After a review of all the evidence in the Veteran's case, the Board finds that the evidence does not support an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss. 

A December 2023 VA audiological examination reflects puretone thresholds of 45, 55, 55 and 45 decibels in the right ear at the test frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, respectively, with an average puretone threshold of 50 in the right ear.? The Maryland CNC speech recognition score is 100 percent in the right ear.  Additionally, the same audiological examination reflects puretone thresholds of 55, 65, 50 and 50 in the left ear at the test frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, respectively, with an average puretone threshold of 55 in the left ear.  The Maryland CNC speech recognition score is 100 percent in the left ear.  Using Table VI, the hearing impairment is Level I in the right ear and Level I in the left ear.

By intersecting the row appropriate for Level I for the ear having the better hearing acuity, here the right ear, and the column appropriate for Level I for the ear having the poorer hearing acuity, which here is the left ear, a zero percent, or noncompensable, disability evaluation results under Table VII.? See 38?C.F.R. §?4.85. 

 

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements that his bilateral hearing loss disability warrants a higher rating.? See May 2024 VA Form 10182.? He is competent to report difficulty with hearing; however, he is not competent to report that his hearing acuity is of sufficient severity to warrant increased compensation under VA's tables for rating hearing loss disabilities because such an opinion requires medical expertise (training in evaluating hearing impairment), which he has not been shown to have.? See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).? In?determining the actual degree of his hearing disability, an objective examination that specifically measures relevant criteria of decibel loss at specific ranges and loss of speech recognition ability is more probative of the degree of the hearing loss impairment than general assertions of difficulty hearing. 

Moreover, the description of his hearing loss must be considered in conjunction with the clinical evidence of record as well as the pertinent rating criteria.? In this regard, the Board emphasizes that disability ratings are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule.? Lendenmann, 3?Vet. App.?349.? Thus, the Board has no discretion in this matter and must predicate its determination on the basis of the results of the audiology study of record. 

In Martinak v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?447, 455-56 (2007), the Court held that, relevant to VA audiological examinations, in addition to dictating objective test results, a VA audiologist must fully describe the functional effects caused by a hearing disability in his or her final report.? The Court also noted, however, that even if an audiologist's description of the functional effects of a veteran's hearing disability was somehow defective, the veteran bore the burden of demonstrating any prejudice caused by a deficiency in the examination. 

In this case, the December 2023 VA examiner addressed the functional effects of the Veteran's hearing loss by indicating that his hearing loss impacts communication.? Therefore, the functional effects of his hearing loss disability are adequately addressed in the record. 

For these reasons, the Board finds that, for the entire rating period on appeal, an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is not warranted.? See 38?C.F.R. §?4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100. 

Should the Veteran's hearing acuity worsen over time, or if the Veteran believes his hearing has gotten worse since his December 2023 examination, the Veteran is encouraged to file a supplemental claim for an initial compensable rating for his bilateral hearing loss disability.  ? 

The Board has also considered whether entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is raised by the record.? See Rice?v. Shinseki,?22?Vet. App.?447?(2009).? Here, the December 2023 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's hearing loss impacted his ability to work in that communication is impacted.? See December 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus DBQ.? The Veteran, however, has not contended that he is unable to work due to his service-connected bilateral hearing loss disability.? 38 C.F.R. §?4.16?(a).? There is no evidence of record that the Veteran is not working due to his bilateral hearing loss disability decided herein.  In fact, there is evidence that Veteran is not working due to being incarcerated.  See May 2024 VA Form 10182.    

To the extent that his service-connected?bilateral hearing loss disability does affect his ability?to perform some?work tasks, the schedular?rating?assigned for his service-connected?disability contemplates the symptoms shown and compensates him for such impairment.? Indeed,?disability?ratings?are intended to compensate impairment in earning capacity due to service-connected?disability.? 38 U.S.C. § 1155,?38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.15; see also Van Hoose v. Brown, 4?Vet. App.?361, 363 (1993) (noting that the?disability?rating?itself is recognition that industrial capabilities are impaired; the record must reflect some factor which takes the case outside the norm).???? 

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.? See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28?Vet. App.?366, 69-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record). 

Accordingly, the appeal is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
