ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on January 25, 2021, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment of the cost of the January 25, 2021, medical services provided by the appellant.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on January 25, 2021, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38?U.S.C. ยง?7105; 38?C.F.R. ยง?20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

On June 4, 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the Veteran electing the Direct Review docket to review a February 2021 Explanation of Benefits. 

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on January 25, 2021, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and entitlement to payment was approved for the January 25, 2021, medical services.  In an August 2022 letter, the AOJ advised the Veteran that the appeal for medical services provided on January 25, 2021, by the appellant was approved after secondary administrative review.  The letter explained that the claim related to this episode of care would be processed according to VA policy. 

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the claimed medical services constitutes a reversal of the denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the Veteran disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38?U.S.C. ยง?7105(d).
