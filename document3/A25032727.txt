ORDER

An effective date earlier than May 8, 2017, for the award of service connection for major depressive disorder (MDD) is denied.

An effective date earlier than September 5, 2014, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record demonstrates that the November 2014 rating decision which originally denied service connection for chronic adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety is final as the Veteran did not initiate an appeal nor submitted new and material evidence within one year of its issuance.

2. The evidence of record demonstrates that the earliest possible effective date for the award of service connection for MDD is May 8, 2017, the date the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's May 2017 VA Form 21-526b, Veteran's Supplemental Claim for Compensation, petitioning to reopen his prior claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability.

3. The evidence of record demonstrates that the August 2008 rating decision which originally denied service connection for sleep apnea is final as the Veteran did not initiate an appeal nor submitted new and material evidence within one year of its issuance.

4. The evidence of record demonstrates that the earliest possible effective date for the award of service connection for OSA is September 5, 2014, the date VA received the Veteran's September 2014 VA Form 21-526b, petitioning to reopen his prior claim for service connection for sleep apnea. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than May 8, 2017, for the award of service connection for MDD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than September 5, 2014, for the award of service connection for OSA have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from June 1986 to April 1995.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 2020 rating decision issued by a VA regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In a June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the AOJ issued the July 2020 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the rating decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Earlier Effective Date

Ordinarily, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim; a claim reopened after final disallowance; or a claim for an increase will be the date the claim was received or the date the entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If the claim was received within one year of separation from service, the effective date of a grant of service connection shall be the day following separation from service or the date the entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Previously, a "claim" was defined more broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014). There was no set form that an informal claim must have taken. See Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351, 1354 (1999). All that was required was that it was a written communication indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by the VA and to identify the benefit sought. Id. 

However, effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims be filed on standardized forms prescribed by the Secretary. 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sep. 25, 2014). In doing so, the non-standard informal claims process prescribed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2014) was replaced with a standard form on which to record an intent to file a claim for benefits. However, for claims and appeals filed prior to March 24, 2015, this amendment is not applicable.

Presently, a "claim" is defined as a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). A claim for VA compensation must be submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. See 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.151(a).

A claimant may file an intent to file a claim to preserve an earlier effective date. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). If VA receives a complete application in the form prescribed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a) within one year of the receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete application filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. Id. However, only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii). 

In the AMA, a claim may be continuously pursued by timely and properly filing an appeal to the Board or a review option before the AOJ after the issuance of an AOJ decision, Board decision, or decision by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). An appeal to the Board or a review option before the AOJ is timely if it is received by VA within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a). It is properly filed when it is on the form prescribed by the Secretary for that specific claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).

The issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 8, 2017, for the award of service connection for MDD.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for his MDD. See June 2021 VA Form 10182; February 2020 Correspondence. More specifically, he asserts that the effective date should be September 5, 2014, the date he filed his original claim for service connection for MDD. 

By way of procedural history, the Veteran first filed claims for adjustment disorder, depression, and anxiety in a September 2014 VA Form 21-526b (received by VA on September 5, 2014). Prior to VA's receipt of the September 2014 VA Form 21-526b no formal claim or written communication that could be reasonably construed as an informal claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is of record. Further, there is no written communication of record that could reasonably construed as an intent to file such a claim.

The AOJ denied service connection for a single acquired psychiatric disability, characterizing it as chronic adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety, in a November 2014 rating decision. Additionally, in the same rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for sleep apnea. The Veteran timely submitted a VA Form 21-0958, Notice of Disagreement, in November 2015 seeking review of that decision under the legacy review system. However, notably, on the VA Form 21-0958, he only explicitly expressed disagreement with the denial of service connection for sleep apnea. As a result, in September 2017, the AOJ issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) only addressing the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. At no time following the issuance of the September 2017 SOC did the Veteran contend that his November 2015 VA Form 21-0958 included an appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability was also on appeal. Ultimately, the Board issued a decision in May 2019 which was also limited to the issues of whether new and material evidence had been received to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea and the underlying issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. 

Thus, as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for chronic adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety, no appeal was initiated within one year of the issuance of the November 2014 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. §§  19.21, 19.52. Further, a review of the claims file shows that no new and material evidence was received within that one year appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). Therefore, the November 2014 rating decision became final as to the denial of the service connection for chronic adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a May 2017 VA Form 21-526b, petitioning to reopen his earlier claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, which was received by VA on May 8, 2017. In a July 2017 rating decision, the AOJ awarded service connection for MDD effective May 8, 2018, the date the May 2017 VA Form 21-526b was received by VA. Between the final November 2014 rating decision and VA's receipt of the May 2018 VA Form 21-526b, no formal claim, informal claim, or intent to file is of record nor any written communication that could reasonably construed as an informal claim or an intent to file such a claim.

The Veteran timely initiated an appeal of the July 2017 rating decision by submitting a July 2018 VA Form 21-0958; however, his disagreement was as to the rating assigned for his MDD and not the effective date of the award of service connection. In December 2018, he opted this legacy review system appeal into the AMA by submitting a Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) Opt-In Election and sought a higher-level review (HLR) of the July 2017 rating decision. Pursuant to this election, the AOJ issued a RAMP HLR rating decision in February 2019 granting an increased rating effective May 8, 2017, the date the May 2017 VA Form 21-526b was received by VA. The AOJ did not address the issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to May 8, 2017, for the award of service connection for MDD. 

The Veteran timely sought review of the February 2019 rating decision under the AMA by submitting a February 2020 VA Form 20-0995. As a result, the July 2020 rating decision on appeal was issued by the AOJ. In the July 2020 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ improperly adjudicated the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for the Veteran's MDD. In Rudd v. Nicholson, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that once a rating decision establishing an effective date becomes final, the only way to revise the outcome is by demonstrating clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in that decision. Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299-300. In other words, the Court held that there can be no freestanding claim for an earlier effective date. Notwithstanding, as the AOJ adjudicated the issue the Board will address the merits of the claim.

In the February 2020 correspondence, the Veteran's representative asserted that the AOJ erred in its November 2014 rating decision denying service connection for the chronic adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety, as it failed to properly apply 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(c) and also overlooked evidence of depression and anxiety that was present in the Veteran's service treatment records which were before the AOJ at the time it issued that decision. However, any errors by the AOJ in applying the relevant statutes and regulations or in their review and consideration of the record do not prevent a rating decision from becoming final.

As noted above, the November 2014 rating decision adjudicating the original September 2014 claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is final. The finality of a prior rating decision cannot be collaterally attacked by a claim for an earlier effective date. The principles of finality apply to decisions that have become final. See DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52, 55 (2006). This principle precludes re-litigation of a claim that was previously the subject of a valid and final decision. An exception to the rule of finality, is revision of a decision based on a finding of CUE. See DiCarlo, 20 Vet. App. at 56. A request for revision based on CUE is a collateral attack on an otherwise final decision on the basis of a specific allegation of CUE. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A. A request for revision of an AOJ decision based on CUE must be decided and appealed in the same manner as any other claim. See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 332-33 (2006). Although not an exception, but closely related, is an unadjudicated claim (i.e., a claim that a decision for which has never been rendered or become final). See DiCarlo, 20 Vet. App. at 56. Once a claim is adjudicated by the AOJ it becomes final unless the claimant appeals the decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(a).

The Board notes that the Veteran has submitted a motion to revise to the AOJ based on CUE in the November 2014 rating decision. See July 2020 Correspondence. However, the AOJ has not issued a rating decision adjudicating whether revision of the November 2014 rating decision based on CUE is warranted. 

To the extent the Veteran and his representative are requesting that the Board address whether the AOJ committed CUE in the November 2014 rating decision, the Board does not have jurisdiction to address that claim as it has not been adjudicated by the AOJ in the first instance. A motion seeking revision on the basis of CUE is completely separate from entitlement to an earlier effective date and must be adjudicated by the AOJ in the first instance. Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006) (explaining that 38 U.S.C. § 5109A requires that a request for revision of a final AOJ decision on the basis of CUE be submitted to the AOJ for initial adjudication). An assertion of CUE is a motion or a request, not a theory of entitlement that can be considered part of another claim. See, e.g., Hillyard v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 343, 355 (2011). 

In view of the above, May 8, 2017, the date the May 2017 VA Form 21-526b was received by VA, is the earliest possible effective date for the award of service connection for the Veteran's MDD as his claim was continuously pursued since the receipt of the claim following the final November 2014 rating decision originally denying service connection for chronic adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. Accordingly, an effective date prior to May 8, 2017, for the award of service connection for MDD is denied.

The issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 5, 2014, for the award of service connection for OSA.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for his claim for service connection of OSA. See June 2021 VA Form 10182; May 2020 VA Form 20-0995. More specifically, he asserts that the effective date should be February 22, 2008, the date he filed his original claim for service connection for sleep apnea. 

By way of procedural history, the Veteran first filed a claim for sleep apnea in February 2008. February 2008 VA Form 21-526, Veteran's Application for Compensation and/or Pension (received by VA on February 22, 2008). Prior to VA's receipt of the February 2008 VA Form 21-526 no formal claim or written communication that could be reasonably construed as an informal claim for service connection for sleep apnea is of record. Further, there is no written communication of record that could reasonably construed as an intent to file such a claim.

The AOJ denied service connection for sleep apnea in an August 2008 rating decision. The Veteran neither initiated an appeal nor submitted new and material evidence within one year of the issuance of this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§  3.156(b), 19.21, 19.52. Therefore, the August 2008 rating decision became final as to the denial of the service connection for sleep apnea. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

Subsequently, the Veteran submitted the September 2014 VA Form 21-526b, which included a petition to reopen his prior claim for service connection for sleep apnea. In the November 2014 rating decision, the AOJ granted the petition to reopen but denied the claim on the merits once more. As noted above, the Veteran timely initiated and perfected an appeal. Ultimately, in the May 2019 decision, the Board awarded service connection for sleep apnea. The AOJ implemented the Board's award in a June 2019 rating decision and assigned the present effective date of September 5, 2014, for the award of service connection for OSA.

The Veteran timely sought review of the effective date assigned by submitting a May 2020 VA Form 20-0995. In response, the AOJ issued the July 2020 rating decision on appeal. 

In May 2020 correspondence submitted along with the May 2020 VA Form 20-0995, the Veteran's representative asserted the AOJ committed CUE when it issued August 2008 rating decision denying the Veteran's original claim for service connection. They stated that the AOJ committed CUE because it failed to properly evaluate the evidence before the AOJ at the time it issued the August 2008 under the applicable statutes and regulations at that time. 

Again, any errors by the AOJ in applying the relevant statutes and regulations or in their review and consideration of the record do not prevent a rating decision from becoming final. Further, to the extent that the Veteran and his representative are requesting that the Board address whether the AOJ committed CUE in the August 2008 rating decision, the Board does not have jurisdiction to address that claim as it has not been adjudicated by the AOJ in the first instance. See Jarrell, supra. 

In view of the above, September 5, 2014, the date the September 2014 VA Form 21-526b was received by VA, is the earliest possible effective date for the award of service connection for the Veteran's OSA following the final August 2008 rating decision originally denying service connection for sleep apnea. Accordingly, an effective date prior to September 5, 2014, for the award of service connection for OSA is denied.
