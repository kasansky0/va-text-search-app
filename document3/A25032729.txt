ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral shin splints is denied. 

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has shin splints related to service.

2. The Veteran's bilateral hearing has been manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level II in the right ear and no worse than Level II in the left ear.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.The criteria for service connection for bilateral shin splints are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1991 to December 1992. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 20204 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the AOJ requested the Veteran submit any relevant private treatment records or submit information with which VA can assist the Veteran in obtaining private treatment records.  Required notice and information were provided in the claim form which the Veteran signed, certifying to the fact that such notice was received and further than they have included or identified relevant evidence. VA requested records for which the Veteran submitted a proper release and/or adequately identified. The duty to assist is not a one-way street. If a Veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining evidence. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). Thus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the duty to assist. No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in development. Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).

The standard set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) only permits constructive receipt of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records that not only existed prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, but also for which the claimant furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of those records. Thus, the Board's consideration of VHA records is limited to the same.  Here, the Board finds that VA treatment records were obtained and reviewed consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) and the AMA framework.

38 C.F.R. § 3.103 provides that a Veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim.  The Board observes that notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing at the AOJ was not provided in this case. In Bowen, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested hearing before the AOJ because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a hearing before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253 (2012). Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket. Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.

Service Connection

1. Entitlement to service connection for shin splints is denied. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for shin splints because they developed as a result of him carrying 120 pounds of gear while marching and running in service. The Veteran asserts that he was diagnosed with shin splints in service and his shin splint pain has continued since service. 

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Here, the record does not show that the Veteran has a current disability of bilateral shin splints.  The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2024. The examiner notes that "although the Veteran notes a history of shin splints there is no objective evidence to support a diagnosis at this time." Additionally, medical evidence of record does not note a diagnosis of shin splints. 

The Board notes that the Veteran has reported that his shin splints developed in service, and he has had ongoing pain since service.  During his March 2024 VA examination, the Veteran endorsed symptoms of flare ups characterized as intense pain precipitated by exercise and alleviated by rest. However, these symptoms were also attributed to the Veteran's bilateral knees which the Veteran reports occasionally swell and gives out.  The Veteran is currently service connected for left knee strain and right knee strain.  The record contains no evidence that the Veteran has a diagnosed shin splint condition with symptoms that would warrant service connection for a separate disability. 

The Veteran has not been shown to have the experience, training, or education necessary to give a probative etiology opinion on these claimed disabilities.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, the Board finds that a lay person is not competent to provide a probative opinion as to the specific issues in this case in light of the education and training necessary to make a finding with regard to the complexities of the shin, to include as due to remote trauma and/or aging. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011); see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Absent a current disability, service connection cannot be established.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral shin splints is denied. 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  

Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Board will consider not only the criteria of the currently assigned diagnostic code, but also the criteria of other potentially applicable diagnostic codes.  

2. Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a compensable rating for his service connected hearing loss. 

The Veteran filed his claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss in November 2023. An April 2024 rating decision granted service connection with a noncompensable rating effective November 17, 2023. The Veteran filed the current VA Form 10182 in April 2024. 

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz).  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII.  

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2024.  The Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:  

March 13, 2024	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	20	15	40	45	30	88%

LEFT	15	20	45	50	32.50	84%

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level II in the right ear and Level II in the left ear.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level II for the right ear and Level II for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a noncompensable disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

Based on the evidence above, a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.  

The Board expressly acknowledges its consideration of the lay evidence of record when adjudicating this claim. The Veteran is competent to report difficulty hearing; however, disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing.  See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

The rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing. The functional impact that the Veteran describes, is contemplated by the rating criteria.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).  The Veteran's main complaint is reduced hearing acuity and clarity, which is what is contemplated in the rating assigned.  See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to a compensable rating for hearing loss.  As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
