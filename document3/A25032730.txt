ORDER

An initial 10 percent rating, but no higher, for right trigeminal nerve dysfunction is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected right trigeminal nerve dysfunction disability has been productive of at most moderate incomplete paralysis of the 5th trigeminal cranial nerve throughout the appeal period. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for right trigeminal nerve dysfunction are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Army on active duty from March 2019 to May 2023. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

An initial 10 percent rating, but no higher, for right trigeminal nerve dysfunction is granted.

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for her right trigeminal nerve dysfunction. 

The Board notes that the AOJ granted service connection in a June 2023 rating decision with a noncompensable rating effective May 31, 2023. In December 2023, the Veteran filed a claim for increase. See December 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. The AOJ continued a noncompensable evaluation in the April 2024 rating decision. 

The Veteran's service-connected right trigeminal nerve dysfunction has been rated under the expressly designated provisions at 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8205 (paralysis of fifth (trigeminal) cranial nerve) throughout the appeal period. Under these criteria, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis of the nerve; a 30 percent rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve; and a 50 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis of the nerve. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8205.

Paralysis of the fifth cranial nerve is dependent upon relative degree of sensory manifestation or motor loss. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8205 Note.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. 

VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (Manual), though not binding on the Board, provides benchmarks for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe peripheral nerves conditions. See Chavis v. McDonough, No. 18-2928 (U.S. Vet. App. Apr. 16, 2021). Per the Manual, mild incomplete paralysis is described as the disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area. Additionally, a very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis. M21-1, III.iv.4.N.4.c.

Moderate incomplete paralysis is described as the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment. Symptoms combinations that may fall into the moderate category include the following: combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. Id. 

While not applicable under the current ratings, it is nonetheless helpful to include that a "moderately severe" evaluation level includes motor and/or reflex impairment at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability, and potentially atrophy. To be described as "severe," it would be expected that there is marked muscular atrophy. Id. 

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for "complete paralysis" given for each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves, Note. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating for incomplete paralysis should be for the mild, or, at most, the moderate degree. Id.: see also Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

Rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all evidence, to the end that decisions will be equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue. Instead, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding a request for an increased disability rating. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran attended a VA examination in May 2023. The Veteran complained of right mid-lower facial numbness after having right jaw surgery. She also reported occasional tingling. Mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias of the right mid and lower face and mild numbness of the right mid and lower face was noted. The examiner diagnosed right incomplete paralysis of cranial nerve V (trigeminal), which the examiner summarily categorized as "moderate." Muscle strength testing was normal and there was decreased sensation of the right mid and lower face. See May 2023 VA Cranial Nerves Diseases examination report, pp. 2, 5.

The Veteran attended a VA examination in January 2024. The Veteran complained of right mid-lower facial numbness after having right jaw surgery. She also reported occasional tingling. Mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias of the right mid and lower face and mild numbness of the right mid and lower face was noted. The examiner diagnosed right incomplete paralysis of cranial nerve V (trigeminal), which the examiner summarily categorized as "moderate." Muscle strength testing was normal and there was decreased sensation of the right mid and lower face. See January 2024 VA Cranial Nerves Diseases examination report, pp. 2, 5.

Based on the above, the Board finds that the criteria for a 10 percent rating under the assigned diagnostic criteria have been met throughout the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8205. See also 38 C.F.R. § 4.3, 4.7.

The evidence of record does not however, show that the Veteran had severe incomplete paralysis of her fifth (trigeminal) cranial nerve at any time during the period on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8205. As noted, the VA examiners found that the Veteran's symptoms were no worse than moderate incomplete paralysis of the fifth cranial nerve. In the absence of evidence showing severe incomplete paralysis or complete paralysis, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximated the criteria for a moderate incomplete paralysis of the fifth (trigeminal) cranial nerve. Accordingly, a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted. See May 2023 and January 2024, VA Cranial Nerves Diseases examination reports. See also Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991) (holding that the Board must consider only independent medical evidence to support its findings rather than provide its own medical judgment).

As such, the most probative evidence of record favors a 10 percent, but not higher, rating for the service-connected right trigeminal nerve dysfunction disability, and to this extent the appeal is granted.
