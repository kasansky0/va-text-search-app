ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.  

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is granted.  

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, as secondary to service-connected back disability, is granted.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Tinnitus is etiologically related to acoustic trauma sustained in active service.  

2. The Veteran's back disability began during active service and has been continuous since separation from service.  

3. The Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is causally related to his service-connected back disability.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.  

2. The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for a back disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.  

3. The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, as secondary to service-connected back disability, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

Preliminary Matters

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Marine Corps from July 1983 to October 1990.  

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from November 2023 and July 2024 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), in which the claims of entitlement to service connection for a back disability and tinnitus were denied, respectively.  

With regard to the service connection claim for a back disability, by way of history, in a September 2016 rating decision, the RO denied the petition to reopen the claim, as no new and material evidence had been submitted in support of the claim.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision; thus, it became final.  Following the issuance of the final September 2016 rating decision, the Veteran filed requests to reopen his claim of entitlement to service connection for a back disability.  

In July 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), appealing the November 2023 and July 2024 rating decisions, denying the claims of entitlement to service connection for a back disability and tinnitus, respectively.  The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  He acknowledged that Direct Review would entail the Board reviewing the evidence of record at the time of the prior decision, with no evidence submission or hearing requests.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 and July 2024 rating decisions.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

The Board notes that in the July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also appealed October 2014 and September 2016 rating decisions.  Specifically, he appealed the denied issues of entitlement to service connection for right foot gout, heart disease, and high blood pressure.  As these rating decisions were issued prior to AMA implementation on February 19, 2019, and were not Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) rating decisions, they are ineligible for AMA review.  Accordingly, in a July 2024 letter, the Board informed the Veteran that his July 2024 VA Form 10182 included the disagreement of decisions that were issued before February 19, 2019, and that these decisions were not eligible for AMA review.  As such, the Veteran's appeal of the issues of entitlement to service connection for right foot gout, heart disease, and high blood pressure were not docketed under the AMA.  Thus, these issues are not before the Board.  

The Board further notes that the November 2023 rating decision on appeal did not explicitly find that new and relevant evidence was submitted in support of the Veteran's back claim.  However, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) adjudicated the claim on the merits.  Thus, adjudication on the merits was an implicit favorable finding by which the Board is bound.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Therefore, the Board will address the merits of the claim.  

As a final matter, the Board notes the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305.  In Williams v. McDonough, the Court held the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In the present case, with regard to the claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, the rating decision on appeal was issued on July 18, 2024.  Thus, the one-year period following the decision has not yet elapsed.  However, the decision below represents a complete grant of the benefit sought.  Accordingly, there is no prejudice with the Board adjudicating the tinnitus claim prior to the expiration of the one-year period, and delaying adjudication would needlessly delay the award of benefits to the Veteran with no potential benefit.  Thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the tinnitus claim.  

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Generally, to establish service connection, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

In addition, for certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, a presumption of service connection arises if the chronic disease was shown as chronic in service; manifested to a compensable degree within one year following discharge from service; or was noted in service with continuity of symptomatology since service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1131, 1133, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the veteran.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994).  Board determinations with respect to the weight and credibility of evidence are factual determinations going to the probative value of the evidence. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; not every item of evidence has the same probative value.  

Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 465.  Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159; see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with a veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence weighs persuasively against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.  

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  He asserts that his tinnitus was caused by in-service exposure to noises.  

Tinnitus is recognized by VA as a "chronic disease" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, and 3.309 apply.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).  

First, on VA examination in February 2024, the Veteran reported recurrent tinnitus.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002) (noting that a layperson is capable of observing tinnitus).  Thus, the first element of service connection has been met.  

Next, favorable findings from the July 2024 rating decision on appeal include exposure to hazardous noise in military service due to the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of Motor Transport.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Thus, the second element of service connection has been met.  

Next, as to continuity, the Veteran has indicated that he has experienced tinnitus since service.  See January 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ.  While there is an absence of complaints of or treatment for tinnitus for many years after service separation, the Board has resolved reasonable doubt in his favor and finds that he had continuous symptoms of tinnitus since service separation and meets the requirements of presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  

Finally, as to nexus, on examination in February 2024, the VA examiner was unable to provide a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and service because there is no report of tinnitus in service treatment records, at separation, or in the medical records until the time of this claim.  This opinion is inadequate, as the lack of in-service evidence alone is not a sufficient rationale to support a negative opinion.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

While the record does not include a medical opinion that indicates a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus with service, the Board does not need to reach the weight assignable to any medical opinion because service connection is granted on a presumptive basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for the "chronic disease" of tinnitus (38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a)) based on a finding of "continuous" symptoms of tinnitus since service rather than on direct service connection.  

In sum, there is evidence of acoustic trauma in service and continuous symptoms of tinnitus since service; therefore, hearing loss is presumed to have been incurred in service and the appeal is granted.  Because the Board is granting service connection on a presumptive basis based on continuous symptoms of tinnitus since service separation, all other service connection theories are rendered moot.  

2. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is granted.  

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for a back disability.  

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records do not reflect that the Veteran had any problems related to the back upon entry into active service.  

Favorable findings from the November 2023 rating decision on appeal include current diagnoses of lumbosacral strain, degenerative disc disease, and intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS).  The RO also found evidence that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset in service.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Thus, the first and second elements of service connection have been met.  

With further regard to the second element of service connection, the Board notes that the Veteran has reported throughout the appeal period that he experienced back symptoms since separation from service.  As previously stated, the Veteran's service treatment records do not reflect that he had any problems related to the back upon entry into active service.  Specifically, the Veteran has asserted that this disability began in service as a result of the wear and tear from physical duties required from his MOS, as he was a truck driver and had to climb in and out of the back of trucks.  See July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Veteran's military personnel records confirm that his MOS was Heavy Vehicle Operator.  Here, the Board finds that the Veteran's assertion regarding the in-service onset of his claimed disability to be competent and credible.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377?(Fed. Cir. 2007) (a veteran is competent to testify regarding continuous pain since service, and lay evidence, when credible, is competent to establish the presence of?continuous?symptoms?for a claimed disability during and since separation from military service); Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1337 (holding lay evidence concerning?continuity?of symptoms?after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence).?  There is nothing to explicitly contradict the Veteran's consistent reports; thus, they are credible?and?competent.?  

Lastly, turning to the nexus prong, the Board notes that the Veteran was afforded a VA back examination in August 2023.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's back condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event or illness.  As rationale, the examiner indicated that there were no findings or complaints of pain injury exposure during service, and that there were no findings or complaints that were found.  The August 2023 opinion is inadequate, as the examiner relied on the absence of evidence.  See id.  The Board also notes that the August 2023 examiner seems to have discounted the Veteran's competent and credible reports of symptoms since service.  

To the extent that the grant of service connection in this matter is based primarily on lay evidence, "nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] require both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself."?  Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1335.  

Moreover, the record reflects that the Veteran's back disability did not exist prior to service.  In addition, the competent and credible statements, as discussed above, show that the Veteran's back disability began during active service and continued post-service.  As noted in the preceding paragraph, the Veteran is certainly competent to testify to symptomatology such as chronic pain.  

Although a remand for further medical opinion could be accomplished, the Board will not remand for negative evidence.  The Board finds that the approximate balance of the evidence is for the claim.  

Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for a back disability is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

3. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, as secondary to service-connected back disability, is granted.  

Having granted service connection for a back disability, the Board finds that the evidence also supports a grant of service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected back disability.  Favorable findings from the November 2023 rating decision on appeal include a current diagnosis of bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

The August 2023 VA back examination report notes that the likely cause of the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is the Veteran's lumbar strain and IVDS.  

(Continued on next page)

Therefore, the Board concludes that a grant of service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, as secondary to service-connected back disability, is also warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
