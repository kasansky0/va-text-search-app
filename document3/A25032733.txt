ORDER

Service connection for a neck disability is granted.

Service connection for a left shoulder disability is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The approximate balance of the evidence supports finding the Veteran has a neck disability manifested by observable symptoms causing functional impairment, and that those observable symptoms began in service and have persisted ever since.

2. The approximate balance of the evidence supports finding the Veteran has left shoulder degenerative arthritis with observable symptoms that began in service and have persisted ever since.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria are met for service connection of a neck disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1113, 5107(b) (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303 (2025).

2. The criteria are met for service connection of a left shoulder disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107(b) (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2025). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from February 1988 to February 1994, February 2002 to June 2002, and May 2004 to March 2005. These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision appealed by a timely November 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) electing the Direct Review docket. Given the Veteran's docket election, the Board will consider the evidence of record as of the July 18, 2023 decision on appeal.

To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) a pertinent event or injury in service; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). In evaluating these requirements, VA must analyze all evidence of record and an evaluation of its credibility and probative value. Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. If the persuasive evidence of record is against the claim, the claim is to be denied. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).

1. Service connection for a neck disability

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) here concedes the Veteran was treated for neck symptoms in service, including a "sore" neck. What remains to be determined is whether he has a current disability and, if so, whether it can be related to the conceded symptoms in service.

For purposes of establishing a current disability, relevant case law holds that symptoms causing functional impairment are sufficient to satisfy that element of the claim. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability" for VA purposes).

Here, the Veteran's explicit claim involves a cervical spine condition, including painful range of motion, which itself suggests functional impairment. Moreover, a statement submitted along with his November 2022 claim indicates he initially injured his neck during service and was seen therein for neck problems. More notably, he reported he has "continued to have varying degrees of pain and issues with [his] neck" as well as treatment by private physicians ever since active service. He treated it with over-the-counter medication, the "RICE" (rest, ice, compression, elevation) method during flare-ups, and stretches he learned in service. He reports shooting, throbbing, and stabbing neck pain with muscle spasms that impact his daily movements and activities, such as "looking down, turning [his] head to the right, bending [his] neck sideways to the right, and bending [his] neck sideways to the left." These actions exacerbated his pain and he reported flare-ups that have increased pain to the point where he cannot move his neck at all or only just slightly. During these episodes, he said he needs to lay down.

Under the circumstances, the Board finds the Veteran has presented competent and credible lay evidence describing lay-observable neck symptoms that began in service (which the AOJ concedes in the first instance) and persist through to the present. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994) (holding that lay evidence can be sufficient to substantiate a claim of service connection where Veterans describe features or symptoms of an injury or illness that they personally observe). Moreover, this evidence also clearly establishes his neck symptoms cause functional impairment such that a current disability may be found even absent a formal neck diagnosis under Saunders. 

Resolving any remaining doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the approximate balance of the evidence supports finding the Veteran has a current neck disability under Saunders that is manifested by observable symptoms which began in service and persist to this day, and grants the appeal in this matter.

2. Service connection for a left shoulder disability

The AOJ here concedes a diagnosis for left shoulder degenerative changes as well as treatment for left shoulder pain in service, and that degenerative arthritis is subject to presumptive service connection as a chronic disease under 38 U.S.C. § 1112 if manifested to a compensable degree within the first post-service year. See also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). Service connection for such disabilities may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after discharge. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). 

Just as above, the Veteran here reports he initially injured his left shoulder in service and, crucially, that his symptoms in service involved pain and limited movement that have continued to bother him "ever since active duty." He specifically described "pain, limited movement, weakness, muscle fatigue, and popping" that has persisted ever since service and require that he "avoid or limit certain activities, like yard work, household chores, utilizing an overhead shelf, sports, exercising or lifting weights, putting on a shirt, and washing [his] car."

Once again, the Board notes the Veteran is fully competent to report the onset, course, and progression of lay-observable symptoms such as those described in this case and, absent and reason to doubt the veracity of those statements, that this evidence also establishes that lay-observable symptoms of left shoulder degenerative arthritis began in service and persist to this day. Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469-70. Consequently, presumptive service connection is warranted under 38 U.S.C. § 1112 and the Board grants the appeal in this matter.
