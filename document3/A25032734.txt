REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from Oct 1970 to August 1999.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which, in pertinent part, awarded a TDIU effective October 11, 2022.  

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.  The Board notes that the Veteran identified the date of the decision he wished to appeal as October 21, 2023, and the specific issue as "earlier effective date for entitlement to individual unemployability."  There is, however, no rating decision in the record dated October 21, 2023, and, more importantly, this date is after the date of the VA Form 10182.  Given the Veteran's clear intention to appeal the effective date assigned for the award of service connection, and construing his VA Form 10182 liberally, the Board finds that the Veteran intended to appeal the August 2023 rating decision and will proceed accordingly.  Based on this procedural history, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the August 2023 AOJ decision cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  Because the Board is remanding the claim, however, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  

Entitlement to TDIU.  

The Veteran has been awarded a TDIU from October 11, 2022, the date VA received his VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  The award of TDIU is based on the combined effects of the Veteran's service-connected cervical spine, lumbar spine, varicose veins, and bilateral upper and lower radiculopathy disabilities.  In written arguments accompanying the Veteran's Board appeal, his representative argued that the Veteran's TDIU claim was part and parcel of an increased rating claim that had been continuously pursued since November 29, 2021, and as such, the effective date for the TDIU should be this date.  In March 2025 written arguments, the Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran was entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of TDIU because the service-connected disabilities that prevent him from securing and following a substantially gainful occupation worsened during the one-year look back period prior to submission of the October 2022 TDIU application.  

At this juncture, the Board finds that the claim must be remanded to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error as the AOJ failed to obtain relevant private treatment records.  An October 2021 VA care management note indicates that a copy of progress notes from Vein Specialists of AK, dated October 15, 2021, was "placed in CleoStreem FYI folder for Wolf PCP review."  These progress notes are not in the claims file and the Board does not have access to the "CleoStreem FYI folder" referenced in the VA case management note.  There is no indication in the record that the AOJ attempted to obtain any outstanding private treatment records, despite evidence suggesting the existence of such.  Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, VA must "make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claimant's claim for a benefit under a law administered by the Secretary."  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c) (obligating VA to obtain relevant records from Federal department or agency).  This duty to assist includes making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records, including private records, as long as the claimant "adequately identifies" those records and authorizes the Secretary to obtain them.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b)(1); Loving v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 96, 101-02 (2005).  The Board finds these private records potentially relevant as they may provide a basis upon which to ascertain that the Veteran's service-connected varicose veins produced unemployability in the year prior to the date of receipt of the claim.  

At the time of the August 2023 rating decision on appeal, the evidence of record suggested the existence of potentially relevant treatment records that have yet to be obtained.  The Board finds that the AOJ's failure to attempt to obtain these potentially relevant treatment records constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1323 (2010) ("[I]f there exists a reasonable possibility that the records could help the veteran substantiate his claim for benefits, the duty to assist requires VA to obtain those records").  As such, a remand of this claim is warranted for correction of this pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. After obtaining any necessary information and authorization form from the Veteran, undertake reasonable efforts to obtain the October 2021 progress notes from Vein Specialists of AK, dated October 15, 2021, that are referenced in the October 21, 2021 VA care management note.
