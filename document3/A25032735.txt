CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction for the period prior to October 10, 2020, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303 (2024).

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for osteopenia are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to September 2005.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2020; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In his October 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

The Board notes that the Veteran subsequently filed two VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested that the September 2020 rating decision denying service connection for erectile dysfunction and osteopenia be reviewed.  These higher-level review requests were erroneously processed by the AOJ, as the October 2020 VA Form 10182 had not been withdrawn and the AMA prohibits concurrent elections.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)-(b).  The subsequent AOJ decisions in September 2021 and October 2021 were therefore issued in error. 

Service Connection

Generally, a veteran is entitled to service connection for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of (1) a current disability (for which service connection is sought); (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a causal connection between the disease or injury in service and the current disability. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Where lay evidence is competent, the Board must weigh the competent lay evidence against the other evidence of record in determining credibility. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1334-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006). However, the absence of corroborating records is an insufficient basis on which to find lay statements not credible. Id. at 1337.

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, which includes but is not limited to equipoise. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1394 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction for the period prior to October 10, 2020

In a September 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for erectile dysfunction, effective date of October 10, 2020.  Because that date does not encompass the appeal period before the Board, the issue of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction for the period prior to October 10, 2020, remains before it.

In the September 2021 rating decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is "directly related to military service."  The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Service connection for erectile dysfunction is therefore warranted, and no additional discussion or analysis is necessary.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

The Board specifically notes that the only issue before it is whether service connection is warranted for erectile dysfunction for the appellate period pertaining to this claim which encompasses the period prior to October 10, 2020. As above, the Board has found service connection is warranted.  An effective date will be assigned by the AOJ upon implementation of the Board's grant herein. Despite any contentions currently being made regarding entitlement to an earlier effective date, as noted, the sole issue currently before the Board is entitlement to service connection.  Any disagreement with the effective date ultimately assigned is a downstream issue that must be separately appealed. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for osteopenia

The AOJ has entered a favorable finding that the Veteran has a diagnosis of osteopenia.  See September 2020 rating decision. Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Therefore, the only question for the Board is whether the Veteran's diagnosis of osteopenia is related to his military service. 

During an October 2005 VA general medical examination, osteopenia of the feet was diagnosed.  The Board notes that this diagnosis was made less than one month after the Veteran separated from his more than 25 years of military service.  The Veteran has not undergone a VA examination for this specific disability; however, the Board notes that no VA examination is necessary as it is resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor on the material issue of nexus, finding it significant that he was diagnosed with osteopenia very shortly after his separation of service and such diagnosis has not been conclusively dissociated from his service. Accordingly, and resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that service connection for osteopenia is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
