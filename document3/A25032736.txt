On March 6, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran via his authorized representative concerning what evaluation and effective date are warranted for multiple sclerosis with sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran via his authorized representative concerning what evaluation and effective date is warranted for right lower neurological condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran via his authorized representative concerning what evaluation and effective date are warranted for right upper neurological condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran via his authorized representative concerning what evaluation and effective date are warranted for the left eye optic neuritis with ophthalmic manifestations have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 2002 to July 2003 and from June 2008 to July 2009.  See DD Form 214.

In the October 2021 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (crossing out the evidence submission election and designating the hearing lane; also referring to his date of claim in September 2020, for which an August 13, 2021 decision was issued); see VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  On March 6, 2025, the Veteran withdrew his hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.704(e); see VA 21-4138.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2021 agency of original jurisdiction decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b); see Notification Letter.  

Withdrawal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  In the present case, the appellant, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal.  Specifically, in a Statement in Support of Claim received March 6, 2025, which included the Veteran's name and file number, the Veteran's representative indicated that the Veteran no longer wished to pursue the issues on appeal.  See VA 21-4138.  The Board notes that this was sent as a follow up to an initial email sent by the Veteran indicating that he wished to withdraw his appeal and including the docket number.  See Email Correspondence.  Thus, the Veteran's submitted request is accepted as a withdrawal of his appeal in its entirety.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  There remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  

Here, the Board finds that the withdrawal is in writing, has the name of the Veteran, the applicable file number, and a statement to the effect that the appeal withdrawn.  See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2020).  Given such, the claim is withdrawn. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Thus, there remains no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.
