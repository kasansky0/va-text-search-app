Pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), service connection for sinusitis is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least evenly balanced that the Veteran has rhinitis and sinusitis disabilities.

2. The Veteran served in the Southwest Asia (SWA) Theater of Operations during the Persian Gulf War (PGW).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for rhinitis have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 1120, 1131; 5107, 1119; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.317, 3.320.

2. The criteria for service connection for sinusitis have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 1120, 1131; 5107, 1119; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.317, 3.320.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps on active duty from August 1988 to July 1992.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 Rating Decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 decision on appeal.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Service connection for rhinitis is granted.

2. Service connection for sinusitis is granted.

The Veteran contends he has a rhinitis and sinusitis disability that is causally related to the Veteran's exposure to burn pits or as the Veteran referred to as "oil well fires" during his active-duty service in SWA.  See August 2023 VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).

Generally, to establish service connection a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  However, in the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

For certain diseases, service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis due to exposure to specified toxins.  Congress passed the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) which increases eligibility for benefits by expanding lists of locations, timeframes, and presumptive conditions related to toxic exposures.

Effective August 10, 2022, the PACT Act established a presumption of burn pit and other toxins (BPOT) exposure for service in the Persian Gulf and related areas.  BPOT exposures include dust storms and other wind-borne suspension of organic and inorganic particles, diesel engine emissions from generators and military vehicles, burn pit emissions, and industrial pollutants.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120.

VA will presume a Persian Gulf Veteran was exposed to BPOT with qualifying active-duty service during identified periods, in any of the following locations on or after August 2, 1990: Somalia, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and the airspace above these locations; or on or after September 11, 2001: Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Yemen, and the airspace above these locations.

The list of diseases afforded this presumption for service connection due to BPOT exposure includes asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis, to include rhinosinusitis.  Although 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 (2022) requires that asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis manifest within 10 years from separation from qualifying service, as of implementation of the PACT Act, that requirement is not being enforced by claims processors as per the PACT Act pre regulatory guidance.  

It is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In this case, the Veteran completed a sinusitis/rhinitis VA examination in October 2023 and the examiner did not diagnose the Veteran with having sinusitis or rhinitis and reported that the Veteran denied having sinusitis.  See October 2023 C&P Exam.  However, the examiner did not address the Veteran's claim that his exposure to burn pits or oil well fires in SWA has caused him sinusitis and rhinitis, nor did the examiner address the Veteran's medical treatment records.  Therefore, the opinion has minimal probative value.  Conversely, the Veteran's VA medical treatment records from early 2023 documented that the Veteran was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis and rhinitis and was being treated for such with medication and follow up medical appointments.  See April and July 2023 CAPRI.

The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran has a current rhinitis and sinusitis diagnosis as documented in his VA 2023 medical treatment records.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds the Veteran has a current rhinitis and sinusitis diagnosis.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A Department of Defense (DoD) memo, received by the VA in January 2023, confirmed the Veteran's Persian Gulf War service per 38 U.S.C. § 1117.  A second DoD memo, received December 2022, confirmed the Veteran's presumptive toxic exposure per 38 U.S.C. § 1119, given the Veteran served on active duty in the SWA theater of operations from August 2, 1990, through July 31, 1991, and the Veteran's BPOT exposure is presumed.

The Veteran's claim was filed in 2023, after the PACT Act, and other theories of entitlement have not been reasonably raised by the evidence of record.  However, having found the Veteran has the requisite SWA service and the Veteran's rhinitis and sinusitis diagnoses are disabilities presumed to be due to his SWA service associated burn pit and other toxins exposure, service connection is warranted on a presumptive basis.  38 U.S.C. § 1120(b); 38 C.F.R. §?3.320.  Accordingly, the service connection claims for rhinitis and sinusitis are granted.
