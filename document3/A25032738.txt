ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee joint osteoarthritis and knee strain is denied. 

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee instability is denied. 

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee strain is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left knee joint osteoarthritis and knee strain is manifest by flexion limited to 70 degrees and functional loss due to pain. 

2. The Veteran's left knee instability is manifest by a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex, without a history of surgical repair, which does not require a prescription for a brace, cane, or walker. 

3. The Veteran's right knee strain is manifest by flexion limited to 85 degrees and pain after repeated use over time resulting in functional loss. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee joint osteoarthritis and knee strain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5260. 

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee instability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5257. 

3. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee strain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5260. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from July 1975 to July 1979 and in the United States Army from March 1996 to September 1997. 

This matter comes before the Board on a July 2023 Higher Level Review rating decision. In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence which was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Governing Law 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Rating Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the Rating Schedule. 

If two disability ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. In view of the number of atypical instances, it is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. It is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. 

In general, when an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?55, 58 (1994). However, staged ratings are also appropriate in any increased rating claim in which distinct time periods with different ratable symptoms can be identified. Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505, 509 (2007). 

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section which could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 205-7 (1995); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). 

Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria."). 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011) ("When § 4.59 is raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record, even in non-arthritis contexts, the Board should address its applicability."). 

When assigning a disability rating it is necessary to consider limitation of a joint's functional ability due to flare-ups, fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement, or when it is used repeatedly over a period of time functional loss due to flare-ups, fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206-7 (1995); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). In Mitchell, the Court explained that, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45, the possible manifestations of functional loss include decreased or abnormal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, or endurance (38 C.F.R. § 4.40), as well as less or more movement than is normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, and pain on movement (as well as swelling, deformity, and atrophy) which affects stability, standing, and weight-bearing (38 C.F.R. § 4.45). Joints should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59; Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158, 169-170 (2016). 

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee joint osteoarthritis and knee strain is denied. 

Knee strain is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260, for limitation of flexion of the leg. Under DC 5260, a noncompensable rating is warranted when flexion is limited to 60 degrees; a 10 percent rating is warranted when flexion is limited to 45 degrees; a 20 percent rating is warranted when flexion is limited to 30 degrees; and a 30 percent rating is warranted when flexion is limited to 15 degrees. 30 percent is the maximum rating under this diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260. 

Here, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2022. The Veteran reported functional impairment after prolonged standing, walking, and running, while traversing stairways, and when squatting. Active range of motion (ROM) testing showed the Veteran's flexion was limited to 70 degrees. Pain during active and passive motion, as well as during weight-bearing testing, was noted. 

The examination was conducted by a licensed physician, who used reliable principles and methods of ROM testing to diagnose the Veteran with left knee strain and instability. As such, the Board finds this opinion probative. 

Although the Veteran's flexion is not limited to 60 degrees, there is evidence the Veteran experiences functional loss due to pain and, as such, he is entitled to a 10 percent disability rating. The Veteran does not meet the criteria for a 20 percent rating as his flexion is not limited to 30 degrees. 

As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an increased rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding "if the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance..., the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt."). Therefore, a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected left knee joint osteoarthritis and knee strain is denied. 

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee instability is denied. 

Knee instability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257, for other impairment of the knee. DC 5257 addresses recurrent subluxation or instability and patellar instability. 

For recurrent subluxation or instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257. 

A 20 percent rating for recurrent subluxation or instability is warranted for either: (1) a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation, or (2) an unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. Id. 

A 30 percent rating is warranted for an unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation. 30 percent is the maximum rating for recurrent subluxation or instability under diagnostic code 5257. Id.

For patellar instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) which does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. Id. 

A 20 percent rating for patellar instability is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair which requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: a brace, cane, or walker. Id. 

A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair which requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker. Id. 

Here, the December 2022 VA examiner recorded recurrent subluxation or persistent instability in the Veteran's left knee, but noted no ligament tear or sprain in either knee. The examiner also did not find recurrent patellar instability in either knee. It was noted the Veteran was prescribed a cane for his left knee. 

As the Veteran does not have a history of a sprain or ligament repair but does have a diagnosis involving the patellofemoral complex, the Veteran will be rated under the criteria for patellar instability. 

The Veteran meets the criteria for a 10 percent rating as he has a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex, without a history of surgical repair, which does not require a prescription for a brace, cane, or walker. The Veteran does not meet the criteria for 20 or 30 percent ratings as he has not had surgical repair. 

As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an increased rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding "if the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance..., the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt."). Therefore, a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected left knee joint osteoarthritis and knee strain with left knee instability is denied. 

3. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee strain is denied. 

The Veteran's right knee strain is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260, as discussed in detail above. 

In the December 2022 VA examination, active ROM testing showed the Veteran's flexion was limited to 85 degrees. No pain was recorded on active testing, however the Veteran reported pain after repeated use over time resulting in functional loss. 

Although the Veteran's flexion is not limited to 60 degrees, he is entitled to a 10 percent rating due pain after repeated use over time resulting in functional loss. The Veteran does not meet the criteria for a 20 percent rating as his flexion is not limited to 30 degrees. 

As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an increased rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding "if the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance..., the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt."). Therefore, a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected right knee strain is denied.
