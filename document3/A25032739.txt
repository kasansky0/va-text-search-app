ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine condition is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder strain with impingement syndrome is granted. 

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's cervical spine condition is related to active service. 

2. The Veteran's left shoulder strain with impingement syndrome is related to active service. 

3. The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is related to obesity. 

4. 2. The Veteran's obesity is caused by service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for the Veteran's cervical spine disability are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

2. The criteria for service connection for the Veteran's left shoulder strain with impingement syndrome are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

3. The criteria for service connection for the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from March 1997 to August 2008.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection 

Generally, service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from an injury or disease caused or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). A grant for service connection for a disability requires: (1) a present disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the present disability and the in-service event, injury, or disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A disability, with no causal relationship ("nexus") to an in-service event can be considered service-connected by being proximately due to or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 § C.F.R. §3.310 (a)-(b). To establish secondary service connection there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) competent evidence establishing a link ("nexus") between the service-connected disability and the current disability.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998). 

VA's Office of General Counsel has determined that obesity is not a disease or injury under VA's laws and regulations and may not be service connected on a direct or secondary basis. VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. However, obesity may act as an intermediate step between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service-connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a). See Marcelino v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 155 (2018); Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020).

A theory of obesity as an intermediary step is raised when there is some evidence in the record which draws an association or suggests a relationship between the Veteran's obesity (or weight gain resulting in obesity) and a service-connected condition. Garner v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 241, 248 (2021). The General Counsel's opinion advises that to decide entitlement to secondary service connection in such a case, the Board is required to resolve (1) whether the service-connected disability caused the veteran to become obese; (2) if so, whether obesity, as a result of the service-connected disability, was a substantial factor in causing the claimed secondary disability; and (3) whether the claimed secondary disability would not have occurred but for obesity caused by the service-connected disability. VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 at 9-10; Garner v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 241, 248 (2021).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine condition.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder strain with impingement syndrome. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for left shoulder strain and a cervical spine condition. See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (July 2023). The Veteran stated that he injured his left shoulder during a training accident. See VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim (December 2022). He reported that he injured his neck during a training exercise when jumping from a helicopter into the water and then being hoisted back into the helicopter. See VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim (December 2022). He contends that his left shoulder and neck pain have continued since separation. 

The AOJ favorably found that the Veteran's historical lay evidence supports an active-duty onset of symptoms of the left shoulder and neck/cervical spine and chronicity of symptomatology from active duty to the current date. The Veteran also has a diagnosis of left shoulder strain with impingement syndrome and cervical strain. See Rating Decision - Narrative (September 2023). The Board is bound by these favorable findings. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran attended VA examinations for his neck and left shoulder. After examining the Veteran, the VA examiner noted that the claimed conditions were at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. See C&P Exam (August 2023).

There is no reasons or bases requirement imposed on medical examiners. An adequate medical report must rest on correct facts and reasoned medical judgment so as inform the Board on a medical question and facilitate the Board's consideration and weighing of the report against any contrary reports. See Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 293 (2012); see also, Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (holding in the context of weighing one medical opinion with another that "[i]t is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion . . . that contributes probative value to a medical opinion"); D'Aries, 22 Vet.App. at 104 ("An opinion is adequate where it is based upon consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and examinations and also describes the disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's 'evaluation of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one.'" (quoting Ardison v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 405, 407 (1994))); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (holding that a medical opinion "must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").

Here, the August 2023 examinations and opinions were provided by a VA medical professional who possesses the necessary education, training, and expertise to provide the requested examination. Additionally, the examiner's findings were based on a review of the Veteran's record and accompanied by sufficient information regarding the Veteran's symptoms. Finally, the VA examiner's opinions are supported by opinions from the Veteran's private physician, who noted that, based upon her professional education and experience and in conjunction with the medical literature, evidence of record, and history of symptoms, it is her professional opinion that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's left shoulder condition and his cervical spine strain are due to, related to, a progression of, and/or a continuation of his injuries which occurred during active duty military service. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (July 2023). Thus, the August 2023 opinion and findings are adequate and constitute highly probative evidence weighing substantially for the Veteran's claim.

The Board notes that there were no other opinions regarding these conditions in the record. Therefore, the probative evidence weighs in favor of the Veteran's claim and service connection for left shoulder strain and a cervical spine condition is warranted.

3. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

The Veteran seeks service connection for sleep apnea. He contends that his service-connected ankle fracture caused him to gain weight, and that weight gain caused or aggravated his sleep apnea. See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (August 2024). The Veteran stated he has been told he snored by his roommates. He also reported having daytime sleepiness and waking up feeling unrested. He uses a CPAP when sleeping. See C&P Exam (July 2022). 

A diagnosis for obstructive sleep apnea and service connection for a primary disability (right ankle fracture) have been conceded. See Rating Decision - Narrative (July 2023). The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The Veteran's roommate from 1998-2001 submitted a statement. He reported that he observed the Veteran stopped breathing on numerous occasions while sleeping; the Veteran would stop breathing at night and would snore almost every night. His roommate reported that he would shake the Veteran to make sure he was all right or roll him over to make sure he was breathing. See Buddy / Lay Statement (September 2021). Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). Here, the Veteran's roommate is competent to describe the Veteran's snoring and his nighttime breathing. Thus, the roommate's competent statement is highly probative evidence weighing substantially for the Veteran's claim.

In addition, in June 2023, a private medical expert reviewed the Veteran's treatment and military service records and opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by his service-connected conditions to include major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, moderate and right ankle status post fracture with fibular displacement with subsequent sleep disturbances and weight gain. The medical expert reasoned that the Veteran has service-connected conditions which can lead to and or cause pain, painful motion, sleep disturbances (related to pain and forced sleep positions related to disabilities), which leads to and/or promotes weight gain and obesity. The medical expert further noted that medical literature has documented that obesity is known to predispose patients to obstructive sleep apnea. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (June 2023). The Board finds this opinion highly probative as it contains clear conclusions with supporting data and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008). This opinion is therefore highly probative evidence in support of the Veteran's claim. 

On the other hand, the evidence includes an opinion addressing secondary service connection. However, the Board finds this opinion inadequate. Specifically, the VA examiner did not address whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was aggravated by his other service-connected impairments. See C&P Exam (July 2022). As this opinion is inadequate, it is afforded no probative weight. 

For the above reasons, the probative evidence weighs in favor of the Veteran's claim and service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is warranted.
