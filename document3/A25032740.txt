ORDER

The appeal seeking entitlement to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) payment of the cost of medical services provided to the Veteran by the appellant on September 8, 2021, (Claim ID 302126900032711000) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The appellant seeks VA payment under the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) for medical services furnished on September 8, 2021.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) does not have the legal authority to decide the appeal and it must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 1703(f); 38 C.F.R. 17.4010(a), (d).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, Aegis Sciences Corporation (ASC), is a non-VA medical provider who rendered services to the Veteran on September 8, 2021.  

This matter is on appeal before the Board from a decision of a VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In December 2021, a notice of disagreement (NOD) selecting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) was received.    

Entitlement to VA payment of the cost of medical services provided to the Veteran by the appellant on September 8, 2021.

The appellant seeks payment through the VCCP of the cost of COVID 19 testing provided to the Veteran on September 8, 2021.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1703; 38 C.F.R. 

§§ 17.4000-17.4040.  The VCCP allows for veterans to receive medical services from non-VA health care providers at VA expense under certain circumstances when authorized by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 1703(a-e); 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4000-17.4040.  The review of a VA decision whether to authorize the furnishing of non-VA medical services at VA expense under the VCCP is subject to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinical appeals process.  Such decisions may not be appealed to the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 1703(f); 38 C.F.R. §§17.4010(a), (d).   

In this case, VA denied payment for the COVID testing provided based on a lack of clarity as to whether such payment had been authorized.  See, e.g., October 2021 Explanation of Payment (EOP), indicating that the underlying claim for payment did not include an "authorization number," a number assigned by VA when non-VA health care has been authorized to be provided at VA expense, and multiple potential authorization matches were found; and August 2023 VHA report of contact, indicating that payment for the September 8, 2021, COVID testing was denied based on multiple authorizations for payment having been found during a secondary search.  See also December 29, 2020, VHA Community Care Memorandum indicating that the previous blanket approval for VA payment of COVID 19 testing by non-VA community providers without a referral and authorization was rescinded effective January 1, 2021, at which time VA payment of COVID 19 testing by a non-VA provider once again required specific referral and authorization by VA.  

Thus, it is evident that this appeal concerns a VA decision whether to authorize payment for non-VA health care under the VCCP.  Consequently, the Board does not have the legal authority to decide it.  38 U.S.C. § 1703(f); 38 C.F.R. 

§§ 17.4010(a), (d).  Rather the controlling legal authority only allows appeal through the VA clinical appeals process.  Id.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
