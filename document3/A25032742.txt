ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. chapter 17 for a low back condition is dismissed.

The application for readjudication of a previously denied claim for service connection for a low back condition (claimed as lumbar spine condition due to injury) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a low back condition (claimed as lumbar spine condition due to injury) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran is in receipt of a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) which renders him eligible for VA treatment for any low back condition; the claim for service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. chapter 17 for a low back condition is moot.

2.  A January 2019 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for a low back condition; the Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement or submit new and material evidence within one year of the decision, which became final.

3.  Since the January 2019 rating decision, new evidence that is relevant to the claim of entitlement to service connection for a low back condition has been presented or secured.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. chapter 17 for a low back condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1710(a), 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.36-17.38, 20.202(a) (2024).

2.  The criteria for readjudicating the claim of entitlement to service connection for a low back condition (claimed as lumbar spine condition due to injury) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101(35), 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1981 to October 1984, and from October 1984 to October 1986.  

An April 1987 administrative decision determined that the character of discharge for the Veteran's first period of service was under other than dishonorable conditions and the discharge was not a bar to VA benefits, but that the second period of service was dishonorable.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision by the Regional Office (RO).  The Veteran filed an appeal to the Board by way of an August 2023 notice of disagreement (Form 10182), and requested a Board hearing which was held before a Veteran's Law Judge in February 2025.  The transcript has been added to the Veteran's file. 

The Veteran elected the Board hearing docket on his August 2023 notice of disagreement.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted within 90 days of the February 2025 Board hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  See Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  Regarding the claimed low back condition, however, because the Board has granted the application for readjudication and is remanding the claim to correct pre-decisional duty to assist error, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the post-remand adjudication of the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Dismissal

The Veteran appealed the denial by a January 2023 rating decision of entitlement to service connection for a low back condition for purposes of VA treatment only under chapter 17.  Subsequently, a February 2025 rating decision awarded a total disability rating for unemployability due to service connected disability (TDIU), i.e., a 100 percent rating.  Because he became entitled to VA treatment under chapter 17 for any low back condition by virtue of his 100 percent rating, the claim has now been rendered moot, and the claim is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1710(a), 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.36-17.38, 20.202(a). 

Analysis

Whether new and relevant evidence has been presented or secured warranting readjudication of a claim of entitlement to service connection for a low back condition (claimed as lumbar spine condition due to injury)

The Veteran seeks readjudication of a previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for a low back condition (claimed as lumbar spine condition due to injury).

A claimant, or his or her authorized representative, if any, who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1) and (b) (2019); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(a)(2), 3.2501 (2024).  "If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the agency of original jurisdiction will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record."  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5108(a) (2019); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d) (2024).

"New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.  Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed."  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1); see also 38 U.S.C. 101(35).  

A January 2019 rating decision denied the Veteran's original claim for service connection for a low back condition on the basis that, among other things, there was no evidence of a current disability.  The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement or submit new and material evidence within one year of the rating decision, which became final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 20.302, 20.1103 (2019).

In October 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim.  A January 2023 rating decision denied the request for readjudication on the basis that no new and relevant evidence had been received.  The Veteran appealed to the Board requesting Direct Review.

At the time of the last final denial in January 2019, the evidence of record included service treatment records showing complaints of back pain and diagnosed muscle spasm and muscle strain, and a post-service September 2018 VA treatment record showing a diagnosis of "low back pain - three months."  See CAPRI, October 2018 at p.3; STR at p.41, 70, 79, 81.

Since the time of the last final denial, new evidence associated with the claims file includes more recent VA treatment records showing diagnosed degenerative changes of the lumbar or lumbosacral spine at L3-4 and L5-S1.  See CAPRI, June 2022 at p.622, 625.

As shown above, since the last final denial, new evidence has been received that shows degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, whereas the previous evidence of record at the time of the last final denial only showed diagnosed low back pain.  The Board finds that this evidence is not only new, but relevant, as it relates to the question of whether the Veteran has a current disability.  

Accordingly, as new and relevant evidence has been presented or secured, the application for readjudication of the claim for service connection for a low back condition is granted.

Before a decision can be made on the claim, however, the Board finds that a remand is required to correct pre-decisional duty to assist error, as explained in the remand section below.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for a low back condition (claimed as lumbar spine condition due to injury) is remanded.

The Veteran essentially asserts that he has a low back condition due to an injury during his active service.

His service treatment records show he was treated in June 1983 for a back pain and a diagnosed muscle strain after lifting ammunition, and in October 1983 for back pain and diagnosed muscle spasm after a motor vehicle accident.  See STR at p.41, 79, 81.  Another service treatment record with an illegible date shows he reported back pain after being thrown down by CID agents.  See STR at p.70.

Post-service VA treatment records show complaint of back pain in September 2018, and a January 2019 x-ray revealed degenerative changes at L3-4 and L5-S1. See CAPRI, October 2018 at p.3, June 2022 at p.622, 625.

A December 2018 VA examiner opined the Veteran's back was normal, and noted that no x-rays were clinically indicated.  As noted above, however, x-rays performed only one month later in January 2019 showed degenerative changes.  Therefore, the Board finds the December 2018 VA examination report to be inadequate.

Another VA examination was performed in October 2022.  This examiner acknowledged the January 2019 x-rays showing degenerative changes, and opined the Veteran's back condition was less likely than not related to his active service.  Unfortunately, the examiner reasoned in part that the December 2018 VA examination was normal.  In other words, the VA examiner's rationale relied on an inadequate prior VA examination from 2018.  Therefore, the Board finds that it constituted pre-decisional duty to assist error for the RO to decide on the claim without first obtaining a new VA medical opinion to clarify whether the Veteran's back condition was related to his first period of active service - to include the motor vehicle accident.  Accordingly, the Board will remand the claim so that a new VA medical opinion may be obtained. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a new VA medical opinion based on a review of the entire claims file, including this remand, to clarify the medical possibility that the Veteran has a low back disability, to include degenerative arthritis, that was caused by his active service - including as due to his treatment in service in June 1983 and after a motor vehicle accident in October 1983.  See STR at p.41, 70, 79, 81.  

Please ask the VA examiner to disregard the December 2018 VA examination report and opinion (due to the x-ray findings of degenerative arthritis one month later in January 2019).

An examination is necessary if required by the examiner to form an opinion.  

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for his or her opinion(s) in the examination report.  If any of the above requested opinions cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner must state this and provide a rationale for such conclusion.
