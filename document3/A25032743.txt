ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress prior to May 23, 2023 is denied. 

Entitlement to a 50 percent rating, but no higher, for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023 is granted. 

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress from August 14, 2023 is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to May 23, 2023, the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress was not manifested by occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. 

2. From May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023, the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress manifested in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity; however, it did not manifest in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, nor did it manifest in total occupational and social impairment. 

3. From August 14, 2023, the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress has not manifested in total occupational and social impairment. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress prior to May 23, 2023 were not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435. 

2. The criteria for a rating of 50 percent, but no higher, for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023 have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435. 

3. The criteria for a rating in excess of 70 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress from August 14, 2023 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service from August 2011 to April 2018. 

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, seeking entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress, most recently addressed in a September 2022 rating decision. In October 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the Supplemental Claim decision on appeal. While this decision did not explicitly address whether new and relevant evidence had been received, the AOJ discussed the merits of the increased rating claim, which is an implicit finding that new and relevant evidence has been received. This favorable finding is binding on the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board). 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The AOJ proceeded to deny a rating in excess of 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. 

Subsequently, in November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the October 2023 Supplemental Claim decision. In April 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 Supplemental Claim decision. Again, the AOJ denied a rating in excess of 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. 

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in April 2024. He elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, consideration may only be given to the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 Supplemental Claim decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR in April 2024. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the October 2023 Supplemental Claim decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR in April 2024, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

After the Veteran's appeal was docketed, but before a decision was reached, the Veteran filed an additional claim with the AOJ for an increased rating for unspecified depressive disorder in August 2024. This resulted in the AOJ making a spurious (out-of-turn) rating decision in November 2024 2024 that granted a 70 percent rating for unspecified depressive disorder, effective from August 14, 2023. The rating increase occurred outside of the eligible evidentiary review window. The Board does not have any appellate purview over those decisions. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

Instead, the Board is limited to considering increased rating during the period ending in October 2023 (the date of the Supplemental Claim decision, which was subject to HLR in April 2024). The issue on appeal is framed without consideration of the additional grant contained in the spurious rating decision. Yet, the Board's instant decision will not disturb the favorable grant of benefits therein.

If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran revoked his appointment of his attorney, James Trieschmann, as his authorized representative in July 2024. To date, he has not appointed a new representative. 

Entitlement to an Initial Rating in Excess of 30 Percent for Unspecified Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress Prior to August 14, 2023 and in Excess of 70 Percent Thereafter

The Veteran was in receipt of an initial 30 percent evaluation for his service-connected unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress prior to August 14, 2023. Thereafter, he was awarded a 70 percent rating. He contends that his symptoms warranted an initial 50 percent rating. 

Disability ratings are determined in accordance with VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability picture more closely approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

The Board will consider whether staged ratings should be assigned to compensate for times when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the pendency of the claim. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). 

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claims of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

Unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress is rated under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula). Under the General Formula, the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130; Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017). The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-18 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

Under the General Formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned when a mental disorder has been formally diagnosed, but the symptoms are not severe enough to either require continuous medication or to interfere with occupational and social functioning. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435. 

A 30 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment with an occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation) due to symptoms such as: depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks (weekly or less often); chronic sleep impairment; or mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events). 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435.

A 50 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as: flattened affect, circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly-learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435.

A 70 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood due to symptoms such as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment due to symptoms such as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting oneself or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435. 

The list of symptoms under the rating criteria are examples of symptoms that would warrant the rating, but they are not meant to be exhaustive. The Board need not find all or even some of the symptoms to award a specific rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442-43 (2002). However, a veteran may only qualify for a specific disability rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 by demonstrating the symptoms associated with that percentage or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration, and that such symptoms have resulted in the type of occupational and social impairment associated with that percentage. Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 117-18. 

In a June 2022 lay statement, the Veteran endorsed/described having a mental health condition secondary to his service-connected disabilities. He stated that his service-connected disabilities caused daily pain, limiting his ability to be active and participate in everyday activities. He could not exercise or complete chores around the house, such as yard work. He was also unable to be as active in his hobbies, like weightlifting, running, and swimming. He stated that he felt down because he was unable to fully enjoy these activities anymore. At work, he had to take a reduced role due to his disabilities, making him less productive in his job. He also reported trouble sleeping and difficulty falling asleep. This sleep impairment led to him feeling tired and irritable the next day, which also made it hard for him to be productive. 

The Veteran's first VA examination pertaining to his psychiatric disability occurred in September 2022. The examiner concluded that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with an occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation due to his unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. His symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and disturbances of motivation and mood. At this time, he reported that he got married in June 2022 and that he did not have children. Regarding his post-military educational and occupational history, he reported attending flight school after his separation from service. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, he ran his own business for a couple of years. In March 2022, he took a job at a farm "that is like running his own business." He reported working as a mechanic at the farm since March 2022. 

Along with his May 2023 VA Form 20-0995, the Veteran submitted a lay statement describing his current mental health symptoms. Her reported that he had been employed full-time as a mechanic for one year. He said that he often found it hard to maintain focus while at work, leading to a decline in his work performance and ability to complete his work efficiently. He also stated that he had been married for a year and a half, and he believed that his mental health condition caused significant strain on his relationship with his spouse. He described frequent angry outbursts and arguments with his spouse. The Veteran went on to describe one instance of shortness of breath, tightness in his chest, and an overwhelming sense of anxiety in the last month. During this incident, he felt scared, confused, and like he needed to find a safe place until the feeling passed. The Veteran also reported trouble remembering names and tasks. He said he often had to write lists to remember to complete work tasks, do household chores, run errands, pay bills, and make phone calls. He also reported sleep impairment, stating that he only slept five hours a night and has a hard time falling asleep. This caused him to feel tired the next day, making it hard for him to be productive. 

The Veteran also submitted an independent mental health evaluation performed by A.E., a family nurse practitioner, in May 2023. She stated that the Veteran's current symptomatology included depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names), impairment of short- and long-term memory (for example retention of only highly-learned material, while forgetting to complete tasks), disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting), and impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability). She also indicated that the Veteran experiences unlisted symptoms, such as impaired sleep, irritability, fatigue, memory and cognitive impairment, and relationship problems. A.E. opined that the Veteran's current mental health disorder most closely approximated the criteria for a 50 percent rating based upon his reported symptomatology and the level of his documented occupational and social impairment, with functional losses in various domains. She also indicated that the Veteran's reported symptoms resulted in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. 

Another VA examination was performed in October 2023. At this time, the VA examiner again found that the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress manifested in occupational and social impairment with an occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation. Regarding social impairment, the Veteran again stated that he got married in June 2022. He was living with his wife and his 17-year-old stepdaughter. No relevant occupational history was reported. He did not report any mental health treatment since the prior VA examination in September 2022. The Veteran reported symptoms including depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and disturbances of motivation and mood. 

The Board finds that staged ratings are appropriate in this case. 

First, the Board concludes that an initial rating in excess of 30 percent was not warranted for the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress prior to May 23, 2023. The evidence of record prior to May 23, 2023 persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's symptoms were consistent with a 50 percent rating. Prior to May 23, 2023, the Veteran's symptoms were instead more consistent with a 30 percent rating under the General Formula. The Veteran experienced depressed mood, anxiety, and chronic sleep impairment, which are associated with a 30 percent rating under the General Formula. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran experienced disturbances of motivation and mood during the period prior to May 23, 2023. Disturbances of motivation and mood are associated with a 50 percent rating under the General Formula. However, the mere fact that the Veteran experienced some symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating under the General Formula prior to May 23, 2023 does not mean that a 50 percent rating is warranted. Rather, the question is whether the symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a 50 percent rating prior to May 23, 2023. Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 114-18. Here, the evidence establishes that the Veteran experienced the overall level of impairment associated with a 30 percent rating during the period prior to May 23, 2023. 

Regarding occupational impairment during the period prior to May 23, 2023, the Veteran stated that he had to take a reduced role at work and that he was less productive. The Veteran's statement indicates that his reduced work productivity was due to his service-connected physical disabilities, not necessarily his unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. The Veteran also indicated that his productivity was limited because of his chronic sleep impairment, which makes him tired and irritable at work. Despite this impairment, however, the Veteran stated during his September 2022 VA examination that he had been successfully employed as a mechanic at a farm since March 2022. 

Despite the above occupational impairment, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress resulted in the level of social impairment required for a 50 percent rating under the General Formula prior to May 23, 2023. The Veteran's June 2022 lay statement did not suggest that his psychiatric symptoms affected his relationships. The Veteran reported during the September 2022 VA examination that he was married. He did not state that his relationships with his spouse, family, or friends were affected by the symptoms of his unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. There are no VA or private treatment records showing otherwise. 

The Veteran did experience some symptoms contemplated by a 50 percent rating prior to May 23, 2023-disturbances of motivation and mood. However, the evidence overall does not demonstrate the level of impairment associated with a 50 percent rating during that period. The Veteran's other symptoms were either contemplated by or more consistent with a 30 percent rating under the General Formula. He was also not shown to experience the level of occupational and social impairment required for a 50 percent rating under the General Formula prior to May 23, 2023. Thus, a rating in excess of 30 percent for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress prior to May 23, 2023 must be denied. 

From May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023, however, the Board finds that a 50 percent rating, but no higher, was warranted for the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. The Veteran's May 2023 lay statement and independent mental health evaluation indicate that he experienced symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating, including disturbances of motivation and mood and impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material while forgetting to complete tasks). 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435. The Veteran also experienced symptoms associated with lower ratings under the General Formula, including depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events). 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435. 

The Veteran also reported panic attacks during the May 2023 independent mental health evaluation. Panic attacks are associated with multiple evaluations depending on the frequency and severity of the panic attacks. For instance, panic attacks occurring weekly or less often are associated with a 30 percent rating. Panic attacks occurring more than once a week are associated with a 50 percent rating. Near-continuous panic that affects the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively is associated with a 70 percent rating under the General Formula. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435. The nurse practitioner who provided the May 2023 private medical evaluation did not specify how frequent or severe the Veteran's panic attacks were. However, in the Veteran's May 2023 lay statement, he described one episode of shortness of breath, chest tightness, and an overwhelming sense of anxiety during the past month. Such indicates that the Veteran's panic attacks were most consistent with the frequency contemplated by a 30 percent rating, as they occurred weekly or less often. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 8435. 

The majority of the Veteran's symptoms during the period from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023 were consistent with a 50 percent rating under the General Formula. While he also experienced difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting) and impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence), which are associated with a 70 percent rating, the Veteran's symptoms in their entirety most closely resemble the level of impairment needed for a 50 percent rating during the period from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023. The evidence shows that he experienced occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity during this period. 

Regarding occupational impairment, the Veteran described how his psychiatric symptoms affect his work in his May 2023 statement. He explained that though he had been employed as a mechanic for a year, he often found it hard to focus at work. This led to a decline in his work performance and his ability to complete tasks efficiently. Furthermore, the Veteran stated that his memory impairment affected his ability to remember to complete work tasks, and his chronic sleep impairment caused him to feel tired at work and make it hard for him to be productive. The May 2023 independent mental health evaluation also shows that the Veteran had difficulty to adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting). Such demonstrates the level of impairment needed for a 50 percent rating under the General Formula. 

The Veteran also experienced social impairment due to his unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. The Veteran stated that his psychiatric symptoms caused a significant strain on his relationship with his wife, as he had frequent angry outburst and arguments with her. The May 2023 independent mental health evaluation supports this, as A.E. stated that the Veteran exhibited impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability) and relationship problems. 

Based on the above, and after resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that a 50 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress during the period from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023. The Veteran's symptoms, when viewed in their totality, are consistent with the symptoms contemplated by a 50 percent rating under the General Formula. Additionally, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, as he had trouble focusing, maintaining productivity, and remembering to complete tasks at work and he was irritable and angry with his wife frequently. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120, Diagnostic Code 9435. Thus, resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the criteria for a 50 percent rating were met from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023. 

A 70 or 100 percent rating was not warranted from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023, however. The severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms are most consistent with that contemplated by a 50 percent rating under the General Formula. Although the Veteran experienced some symptoms associated with a 70 percent rating, as discussed above, the persuasive weight of the evidence, when viewed holistically, does not demonstrate the level of impairment associated with a 70 or 100 percent rating. Notably, the evidence does not show that the Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relationships, judgment, thinking, and mood. The Board again acknowledges that the Veteran had reduced productivity due to his inability to focus, memory impairment, and chronic sleep impairment. This evidence was considered in the assignment of the 50 percent rating above. However, he has not indicated that he is unable to perform his job on a frequent basis or that he has faced negative performance reviews or disciplinary actions due to his psychiatric symptoms. Nor has the Veteran exhibited the degree of social impairment required for a 70 percent rating. Although he described angry outbursts and arguments with his spouse, he did not suggest that he had issues in his relationships with friends or other family members. The evidence of record also fails to show impairment of judgment or thinking from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023. 

Thus, the Board concludes that a 50 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023. A rating in excess of 50 percent is not warranted from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023. 

The AOJ assigned a 70 percent rating for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress with traumatic brain injury (TBI), effective August 14, 2023. The effective date was assigned based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's intent to file a claim, followed by a completed VA Form 20-0995 within one year. However, the Board again notes that consideration may only be given to the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 Supplemental Claim decision, which was then subject to HLR in April 2024. 

The Board has considered the applicable evidence and concludes that there is no evidence showing that a rating in excess of 70 percent is warranted during the period from August 14, 2023. Based on review of the October 2023 VA examination, the Veteran experienced symptoms including depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and disturbances of motivation and mood. These symptoms are associated with ratings below 100 percent under the General Formula. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435. The Veteran did not exhibit any symptoms associated with a 100 percent rating, nor did he experience symptoms of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those contemplated by a 100 percent rating. There is also no available evidence showing that the Veteran experienced total occupational and social impairment. The Veteran did not report any relevant occupational history during the October 2023 VA examination, and there is no other evidence for consideration that shows that he was unable to work due to his psychiatric symptoms during the period beginning August 14, 2023. Regarding social impairment, he stated that he was living with his wife and teenage stepdaughter at the time of the October 2023 examination. He did not describe that he was unable to maintain his relationships with his family and friends due to his psychiatric disorder during the period beginning August 14, 2023. Thus, there is no evidence available for consideration showing that a 100 percent rating was warranted for the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress with TBI.

In sum, the Board concludes that a 50 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023. For the reasons and bases discussed, however, the evidence for the claims versus the evidence against the claims is not in "approximate" balance (i.e., nearly equal). Instead, the most probative and, therefore, most persuasive evidence is against these claims. See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The claims for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent prior to May 23, 2023, a rating in excess of 50 percent from May 23, 2023 to August 13, 2023, and a rating in excess of 70 percent from August 14, 2023 must be denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
