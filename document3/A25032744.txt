The appeal seeking an effective date prior to April 20, 2020, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The rating decision that granted service connection for PTSD and assigned an initial 70 percent rating, effective April 20, 2020 (exclusive of a temporary total rating period from December 22, 2020, to April 1, 2021), was issued on June 25, 2021. 

2. The VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) appealing the PTSD issue was received on August 15, 2022, more than one year after the June 2021 rating decision. 

3. The Veteran did not request an extension of time for filing the NOD, and the Board did not waive its right to enforce the one-year deadline for filing the NOD.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal seeking an initial rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD stemming from an NOD received in August 2022 have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal seeking an effective date prior to April 20, 2020, for the grant of service connection for PTSD, stemming from an NOD received in August 2022 have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.203. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2005 to August 2009. He is the recipient of the Combat Action Badge.

This appeal stems from a VA Form 10182 that was received on August 15, 2022, and docketed by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on August 26, 2022. However, a review of the claims file does not show that this form may be accepted as a timely appeal to the Board of a rating decision issued under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

A June 2021 rating decision, in pertinent part, granted service connection for PTSD with an initial rating of 70 percent, effective April 20, 2020 (and also granted a temporary total rating from December 22, 2020, to April 1, 2021, due to hospitalization over 21 days). Thereafter, in August 2022, the Veteran submitted the aforementioned VA Form 10182. On the form, the Veteran identified the specific issue with which he disagreed as PTSD and the area of disagreement as "service connection." The Veteran also identified the date of decision as "2021-08-16."  However, no decision was rendered on August 16, 2021, for an issue related to PTSD.  Prior to the August 2022 VA Form 10182, the only rating decision in the claims file that adjudicated a claim for PTSD was in the June 2021 rating decision.   As service connection was granted for PTSD in June 2021, the Board has construed the August 2022 VA Form 10182 as an attempt to appeal both the initial rating and effective date assigned for the PTSD. 

Pursuant to the AMA, an appeal of a rating decision issued on or after February 19, 2019, is filed by submitting an NOD within one year after the date the notification of that decision was mailed to the Veteran. See 38 U.S.C.  § 7105 (stating a Notice of Disagreement "shall be filed within one year"); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(a) (stating an NOD "must" be filed within one year). As discussed above, in the VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated he was appealing an August 16, 2021, decision. However, in this case, the only documents issued to the Veteran in August 2021 were letters by the VA Debt Management Center and pertaining to debt he had incurred through overpayment of education benefits. The only rating decision issued in proximity to the August 2022 VA Form 10182, as well was the only rating decision to address PTSD, was issued on June 15, 2021. 

The Board acknowledges that the one-year deadline to file an NOD is not a jurisdictional bar to Board review, but a mandatory claims-processing rule that the Board may implicitly or explicitly waive. See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (en banc). The Board may choose to waive the deadline if good cause is shown in support of an extension request or if the Board has waived its entitlement to enforce the deadline. See Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, at 46-47 (2009). 

In this case, the Veteran has not requested an extension of time for filing the NOD or any explanation for the late filing. Therefore, the Board may not waive the time limit on the basis of good cause being shown for the delay. 

Further, while the Board sent a letter in August 2022 advising him that that the appeal had been placed on the Board's docket, this communication alone is not sufficient to constitute a waiver. Docketing an appeal does not involve review of the claims by a Board attorney and Veterans Law Judge. It is an administrative task in which the NOD is identified and added along with the issues identified on the form to the Board docket chosen by the Veteran, i.e., direct review, evidence submission, or hearing docket. This process does not entail consideration of the record, including whether there are any procedural defects. 

Beyond the docketing letter, there is no documentation in the record that reflects action on the appeal by the Board or that otherwise would lead the Veteran to believe that the Board had waived its right to dismiss the appeal based on the late filing of the NOD. Therefore, the Board is also not required to waive the time limit on the basis that the Board had waived its right to decline to do so.

Accordingly, the Board sees no basis upon which to waive the one-year time deadline for filing the NOD in this case. As such, the August 2022 NOD was not timely with the June 2021 rating that adjudicated the issue of PTSD, or with any rating decision issued by the AOJ, and the appeal must be dismissed.
