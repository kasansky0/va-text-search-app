REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the National Guard, including many periods of active duty between January 2005 and September 2024. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July (notice on the 9th) 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In his July 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD) on a VA Form 10182, the Veteran referenced the July 2024 decision and elected the Board's Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 5, 2024, Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after July 5, 2024, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Under the modernized appeal system, a veteran is entitled to a one-year window within which the veteran may switch Board review dockets if desired by submitting a new, completed VA Form 10182. A Veteran may also waive this docket switch window. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 205 (2024). A request to modify a NOD must be made by completing a new NOD on a form prescribed by the Secretary, and must be received at the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction mails notice of the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). In the Board's August 2024 docketing letter, VA advised the Veteran of the ability to switch dockets. Because the notice for the July 2024 rating decision was mailed on July 9, 2024, he currently has time pending to switch dockets. However, in February 2025 written correspondence, the Veteran sought immediate review of his appeal, which the Board interprets as a waiver the right to select a different Board docket. Based on this knowing waiver, the Board will proceed with adjudication of this case.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he has a sleep apnea condition that is related to his active service.

The March 2024 VA examiner noted that the records do not show that the Veteran has completed formal polysomnography testing to diagnose sleep apnea. Nonetheless, the examiner acknowledged that the Veteran was assessed to have sleep apnea during a sleep endoscopy procedure in October 2019 (see 5/15/2024 MTR - Non-Gov't Facility, at 1). The examiner opined that the any diagnosis of sleep apnea is less likely than not related to in-service toxic exposure risk activities. 03/22/2024, C&P Exam; 03/22/2024, C&P Exam (medical opinion). 

However, the examiner did not provide an opinion as to whether the onset of any sleep apnea condition occurred during a period of active service. Additionally, the service treatment records reveal that the Veteran reported symptoms of snoring in August 2019. 07/02/2024, STR - Medical, page 1. 

After a review of the evidence of record the Board finds the March 2024 VA examination, which was of record at the time of the July 2024 rating decision on appeal, is inadequate, as it did not address whether the onset of sleep apnea occurred during active service. The failure to provide an adequate examination/opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. The Board finds that that an addendum medical opinion is required to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination with an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of any sleep apnea condition. The examiner is to review the virtual file, including a copy of this Remand, to become familiar with the relevant medical history related to the Veteran's chest pain condition, to include obtaining a full history from the Veteran.

The examiner is to provide an opinion whether any current sleep apnea condition is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The examiner must provide an opinion as to the etiology of each diagnosed sleep apnea condition.

**Additionally, the examiner must explicitly consider the service treatment records showing that the Veteran reported symptoms of snoring. 07/02/2024, STR - Medical, page 1.**

A comprehensive rationale for all opinions is to be provided. All pertinent evidence, including both lay and medical, should be considered.

?

If an opinion cannot be given without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
