FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The weight of the evidence of record is against a finding that there was an ascertainable increase in severity of Huntington's Chorea prior to December 21, 2022.

2. The weight of the evidence of record is against a finding that there was an ascertainable increase in severity of the psychiatric disability prior to December 21, 2022.

3. The Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for hypothyroidism on July 8, 2022.  The record does not contain an informal or formal claim for service connection for hypothyroidism that was filed prior to July 8, 2022.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date than December 21, 2022, for an increased rating of 80 percent for Huntington's Chorea have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.157, 3.159, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date than December 21, 2022, for an increased rating of 70 percent for major depressive disorder with generalized anxiety disorder have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.157, 3.159, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date than July 8, 2022, for service connection for hypothyroidism have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2019 to January 2021.??????? 

A July 2023 rating?decision denied the earlier effective date claims.  In January 2024, the Veteran requested a direct review of the appeal by the Board.? This case comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the July 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)?Veterans Benefits Administration Regional Office (RO), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).??? 

As the current appeal stems from the Veteran's selection of direct review, in which the Veteran acknowledged that the review will be based on the evidence submitted to VA at the time of the AOJ decision on the issues on appeal, only evidence of record as of the date of the July 2023 rating decision will be considered.

Earlier Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an of an award of increased compensation is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

An exception to that rule applies where the evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation.  If an increase in disability is factually ascertainable within one year prior to the receipt of the claim, the rating will be effective as of the date of increase.  However, if the increase occurred more than one year prior to receipt of the claim, the increase will be effective on the date of receipt of the claim.  If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date will be the date of the increase.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Additionally, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to a decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  For decisions made after a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182. 

In the case of continuously pursued claims, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options, including a Supplemental claim, request for HLR, or appeal to the Board, within one year of the issuance of the decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500.

The term continuous pursuit only applies to Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) decisions.  Specifically, when a claim filed under the AMA is granted in an initial decision, the effective date of an AMA initial decision will be the later of the date of the supplemental claim, or the date of entitlement.  Continuous pursuit of a claim would apply to all AOJ decisions issued on or after February 19, 2019; or to decisions issued within the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) that were issued prior to the implementation of the AMA.  Thus, even if a supplemental claim is received within one year of a legacy decision, the date of receipt of the supplemental claim will be considered the date of claim for effective date purposes.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2500

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date than December 21, 2022, for an increased rating of 80 percent for Huntington's Chorea.

The Veteran's service-connected Huntington's chorea is rated under Diagnostic Code 8106.  Under Diagnostic Code 8106, Huntington's chorea is rated as Sydenham's chorea.  Sydenham's chorea is rated under Diagnostic Code 8105.  Under Diagnostic Code 8105, a 10 percent rating is assigned for a mild disability.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for a moderate disability.  A 50 percent rating is assigned for a moderately severe disability.  An 80 percent rating is assigned for a severe disability. A 100 percent rating is assigned for a pronounced, progressive grave type disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8105, 8106.

The words mild, moderate, and severe are not defined in the Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are equitable and just.  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue.  Rather, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding a request for an increased disability rating.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

While not specifically defined in the regulations, the Board has considered the general definitions of the terms mild, moderate, and severe.  Mild is defined as not severe or temperate; with temperate being defined as keeping or held within limits and not extreme or excessive.  MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARY.  Moderate is defined as tending toward the mean or average amount; not violent, severe, or intense; and limited in scope or effect.  Severe is defined as very painful or harmful, or of a great degree.  The term severe is used throughout the rating schedule to indicate a very great degree of the specific listed disability, in order to differentiate between lesser, or sometimes greater, cases of that same disability within the specific diagnostic code.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.

The Veteran contends than an earlier effective date than December 21, 2022, for the assignment of an 80 percent rating for service-connected Huntington's Chorea is warranted.  

The Veteran asserts that the increased rating claim was continuously pursued since July 8, 2022, the effective date of service connection.  Therefore, the Veteran believes, at minimum, the current 80 percent rating should be constant since the initial effective date of service connection.

The Veteran first filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for Huntington's Chorea on July 8. 2022.  As a result, the Veteran underwent VA examination in September 2022.  During that examination, the examiner found the condition to resulted in moderate swallowing difficulties and persistent daytime hypersomnolence, but no respiratory issues, bowel or voiding impairment, or erectile dysfunction.  At the time of the examination, the Veteran's gait was mildly dyskinetic and unsteady.  The Veteran's speech, muscular strength, and reflexes were normal.  The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy.  The Veteran did experience cognitive difficulties, including short- and long-term memory loss.  The Veteran also experienced mild generalized chorea, mask-like facial expression, mild diffuse rigidity, and bradykinesia 1+ in the hands and legs.

An October 2022 rating decision established service connection for Huntington's Chorea and assigned a 10 percent rating, effective July 8, 2022, the date of the initial claim filing for service connection.  

On December 21, 2022, VA received a VA Form 21-0966 intent to file a claim.

Subsequently, on February 28, 2023, VA received a supplemental claim for an increased rating for service-connected Huntington's Chorea and VA also received a private examination.  The private examination showed mild swallowing difficulties, hypersomnia, slurred speech, worsening imbalance, mild muscle weakness, depression, and anxiety.

At a May 2023 VA examination, the examiner found moderate swallowing difficulties, persistent daytime hypersomnolence, slurred speech, abnormal gait, decreased muscle strength.  The examiner found mild bilateral upper and left lower extremity weakness and moderate right lower extremity weakness.  The examiner also found mild generalized chorea, mask-like facial expression, mild diffuse rigidity, and bradykinesia 1+ in the hands and legs.  The examiner noted severe involuntary movements. 

A June 2023 rating decision increased the rating for Huntington's Chorea to 80 percent, effective December 21, 2022, the date of the supplemental claim filing and receipt of the private examination, which led to the May 2023 VA examination.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has continuously pursued a claim for an increased rating for Huntington's Chorea since the initial rating establishing service connection.  However, the Board finds that the date entitlement arose is the proper effective date for the increased rating.  Here, that date is May 17, 2023, the date of the VA examination showing severe symptomatology.  However, because that examination was ordered as a result of the December 21, 2022, intent to file a claim filing and the private examination, VA resolved all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and found that the increase in disability arose as of December 21, 2022.

The Board finds that the medical evidence of record does not support the assignment of an 80 percent rating prior to December 21, 2022.

The Board notes that the Veteran's Huntington's Chorea resulted in some cognitive and psychiatric symptoms.  However, those symptoms have been noted on examination to be impossible to differentiate from the symptoms of service- connected major depression with generalized anxiety disorder.  The rating of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  Therefore, the cognitive and psychiatric symptoms have been compensated in the disability rating for the psychiatric disability and cannot be considered in the disability rating of Huntington's Chorea.

After reviewing the record, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding that an effective date prior to December 21, 2022, for the assignment of an 80 percent rating for Huntington's Chorea is warranted.  The evidence does not support a finding that an increase in severity of the disability was factually ascertainable within one year prior to the December 21, 2022.  The first evidence of record showing an ascertainable increase in the Veteran's disability is the May 2023 VA examination showing severe symptomatology of the disability.  Prior examination found a less severe condition with no symptomatology being noted as severe. The Board has considered the Veteran's statements but finds that they do not outweigh the evidentiary value of medical records and the examination reports.  The Board finds that September 2022 VA examination more persuasive as it was contemporary to the time when it was conducted and was based on interview and examination of the Veteran which indicated that the condition mainly resulted in mild symptomatology.

The Board notes that the treatment notes in the year prior December 21, 2022, do not support a finding that a factually ascertainable increase in disability had occurred.

While the Veteran continuously pursued a claim for an increased rating for a Huntington's Chorea since the initial decision establishing service connection effective July 8, 2022, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not support the assignment of an 80 percent rating prior to December 21, 2022.  Thus, the date service connection was first established is not the proper effective date for the increased 80 percent rating.

The Board is not authorized to rule in equity but is bound by the applicable statutes and regulations.  Any claim in equity must be pursued with the Secretary of VA. 38 U.S.C. § 503.

The Board is appreciative of the Veteran's faithful and honorable service to our country.  However, as the weight of the evidence is against the assignment of an earlier effective date for an increased rating for Huntington's Chorea, the claim must be denied.  The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date than December 21, 2022, for an increased rating of 70 percent for major depressive disorder with generalized anxiety disorder.

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date than December 21, 2022, for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for service-connected major depressive disorder with generalized anxiety disorder is warranted.  

The Veteran asserts that the increased rating claim was continuously pursued since July 8, 2022, the effective date of service connection.  Therefore, the Veteran believes, at minimum, the current 70 percent rating should be constant since initial effective date of service connection.

The Veteran first filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for major depressive disorder with generalized anxiety disorder on July 8. 2022.  As a result, the Veteran underwent VA examination in September 2022.  During that examination, the examiner, a psychologist, found the condition to result in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A September 2022 rating decision established service connection for a psychiatric disability and assigned a 50 percent rating, effective July 8, 2022, the date of the initial claim filing for service connection.  

On December 21, 2022, VA received a VA Form 21-0966 intent to file a claim.

On February 28, 2023, VA received a supplemental claim for an increased rating for the service-connected psychiatric disability.  As result, the Veteran underwent VA examination in May 2023.  The May 2023 VA examination found that the psychiatric disability resulted in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood.

A June 2023 rating decision increased the rating for major depressive disorder with generalized anxiety disorder to 70 percent, effective December 21, 2022, the date of the supplemental claim filing, which led to the May 2023 VA examination.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has continuously pursued a claim for an increased rating for a psychiatric disability since the initial rating establishing service connection.  However, the Board finds that the date entitlement arose is the proper effective date for the increased rating.  Here, that date is May 16, 2023, the date of the VA examination showing an increase in disability.  However, because that examination was ordered as a result of the December 21, 2022, intent to file a claim filing, VA resolved all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and found that the increase in disability arose as of December 21, 2022.

The Board finds that the medical evidence of record does not support a 70 percent rating prior to December 21, 2022.

After reviewing the record, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding that an effective date prior to December 21, 2022, for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for the psychiatric disability is warranted.

The first evidence of record showing an ascertainable increase in the Veteran's disability is the May 2023 VA examination showing occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood.  Prior examination found a less severe condition and did not find deficiencies in most areas due to the service-connected condition.  The Board has considered the Veteran's statements but finds that they do not outweigh the evidentiary value of medical records and the examination reports.  For the period prior to December 21, 2022, the Board finds that September 2022 VA examination more persuasive as it was contemporary to the time when it was conducted and was based on interview and examination of the Veteran which indicated that the condition mainly resulted in depressed mood, anxiety, sleep impairment, flattened affect, and disturbance of motivation and mood.  The Board finds that those findings do not demonstrate occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, which would be required for a higher rating.

The Board notes that the treatment notes in the year prior December 21, 2022, do not support a finding that a factually ascertainable increase in disability had occurred.

While the Veteran continuously pursued a claim for an increased rating for a psychiatric disability since the initial decision establishing service connection effective July 8, 2022, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not support the assignment of a 70 percent rating prior to December 21, 2022.  Thus, the date service connection was first established is not the proper effective date for the increased 70 percent rating.

The Board is appreciative of the Veteran's faithful and honorable service to our country.  However, as the weight of the evidence is against the assignment of an earlier effective date for an increased rating for major depressive disorder with generalized anxiety disorder, the claim must be denied.  The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107.

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date than July 8, 2022, for service connection for hypothyroidism.

Generally, the effective date for service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For reopened claims, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim to reopen or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r).

Generally, a claim which has been denied in a final unappealed rating decision, or a rating decision that was appealed but was not perfected, may not thereafter be reopened and allowed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c)-(d)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.  If new and material evidence was presented or secured with respect to a claim which has been disallowed, VA shall reopen the claim and review the former disposition of the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).

A claim is considered abandoned when a claimant does not supply information requested by VA within one year of the request.  38 C.F.R. § 3.158.  Where there is an abandoned claim, the Veteran must file a new claim, and the effective date will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the new claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.158(a).

The Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for hypothyroidism on July 8, 2022.  As a result of that claim filing, in an October 2022 rating decision, service connection for hypothyroidism was established. 

Having reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds that July 8, 2022, is the earliest effective date legally assignable for service connection for hypothyroidism.

The Board emphasizes that previous determinations that are final and binding, including decisions of service connection, will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

The statutory framework does not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits that is predicated upon a reopened claim following a final disallowance.  Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244 (2002).  For the Veteran to be awarded an effective date based on an earlier claim, he would have to show CUE in a prior denial of the claim.  Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332 (1995).  However, neither the Veteran nor representative has alleged CUE in any prior rating decision.  Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (breach of the duty to assist cannot form the basis for a CUE claim).

A final decision can only be revised on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  38 C.F.R. § 3.105. The Board does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate in the first instance assertions of CUE in AOJ decisions.  Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006) (assertion of CUE in an AOJ decision must first be presented to and decided by the AOJ before the Board has jurisdiction to decide the matter).  However, the Veteran has not alleged any specific CUE that could be referred to the AOJ for adjudication.

The Board is aware that the Veteran seeks an earlier effective date than July 8, 2022.  However, without having perfected an appeal as to allegations of clear and unmistakable error in any previous rating decision denying entitlement to service connection, the Veteran may not now vitiate the finality of that decision.  Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

The assignment of an effective date for service connection based on an original claim or a claim to reopen is essentially governed by the date of receipt of the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Here, the current effective date corresponds to the date VA first accepted the Veteran's application for a claim for service connection for hypothyroidism. The Board has carefully reviewed the record in its entirety and can identify no communication, informal or formal, from the Veteran that may constitute a claim of entitlement to service connection for hypothyroidism prior to July 8, 2022.  Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196 (1992) (Board must look at all communications that can be interpreted as a claim, formal or informal, for VA benefits).  Moreover, neither the Veteran nor representative has identified any earlier claim.

The legal authority governing effective dates is clear and specific.  The Board is not authorized to rule in equity but is bound by the applicable statutes and regulations.  Any claim in equity should be pursued with the Secretary of VA.  38 U.S.C. § 503.

Accordingly, after reviewing the record, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding that an effective date, prior to July 8, 2022, for the service connection for hypothyroidism is warranted.  The Board is appreciative of the Veteran's faithful and honorable service to our country.  However, as there is no legal basis for assignment of any earlier effective date, and because the weight of the evidence is against the claim for any earlier effective date, the Board finds that the claim must be denied.  The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran.  Therefore, the appeal is denied.  38 U.S.C. §?5107.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date than December 21, 2022, for entitlement to TDIU is remanded.

The Veteran contends that an award of a TDIU pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.16, prior to December 21, 2022, is warranted.

For consideration for TDIU pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a), the Veteran must meet a minimum percentage combined service-connected rating.  If the Veteran has one service-connected disability, it must be rated 60 percent or more.  If the Veteran has two or more service-connected disabilities, at least one disability must be rated 40?percent or more and the combined rating of all the service-connected disabilities must be 70 percent or more.  38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a). 

The Veteran does not meet the percentage criteria for consideration of the assignment of TDIU under 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a) prior to December 21, 2022.  Prior to December 21, 2022, the Veteran had established service connection for a psychiatric disability, rated 50 percent; Huntington's chorea, rated 10 percent; and hypothyroidism, rated 0 percent.  The combined service-connected disability rating was 60 percent.  The disabilities cannot be considered as a single entity for the purposes of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

Where a Veteran does not meet the percentage rating requirements under 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a), the Veteran still may be found totally disabled pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b) when the evidence indicates that the Veteran is unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities. 

Under that circumstance, the matter should be referred to the Director of the Compensation Service for consideration.  Bagwell v. Brown, 9?Vet. App.?337 (1996); Floyd v. Brown, 9?Vet. App.?88 (1996); Shipwash v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?218 (1995).  TDIU consideration requires contemplation of the severity of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue.  38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b).  The Board does not have the authority to award TDIU under 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b) prior to referral to the Director.  Kuppamala v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?447 (2015). 

In determining whether TDIU is warranted, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38?U.S.C. §?5107.  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the claimant. 

As the record currently stands, it is unclear whether the Veteran was unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment due to the service-connected disabilities prior to December 21, 2022.

The Board notes that there is evidence suggesting that the service-connected disabilities may have precluded the Veteran from obtaining and maintaining gainful employment prior to December 21, 2022.  The record contains a VA central nervous system and neuromuscular disease examination from September 2022 which may suggest that the Huntington's chorea and psychiatric disability resulted in substantial physical and mental impairment. 

In viewing the Veteran's disability picture in its totality, and evaluating the Veteran's work history and education, the Board notes that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the service-connected disabilities may have created a circumstance in which the Veteran may not have been able to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment prior to December 21, 2022, and that referral to the Director for consideration of the assignment of TDIU pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b) is warranted. 

Remands are not solely for the correction of pre-decisional duty to assist errors.  The AMA specifically allows for remands where the AOJ did not satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  As the referral process is a duty found in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) to be undertaken by the AOJ, that is contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 as a regulatory duty and valid reason to remand.  Therefore, the Board finds remand is warranted for referral to the Director of the Compensation Service for TDIU consideration prior to December 21, 2022, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date than December 21, 2022, for entitlement to special monthly compensation based on the need for aid and attendance or housebound status is remanded.

The Board finds that the issue of entitlement to special monthly compensation is inextricably intertwined with the issues of entitlement to TDIU.  The issues are inextricably intertwined when they are so closely tied together that a final decision on one issue cannot be made until the other issue has been considered.  Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991).  Accordingly, since the TDIU claim is being remanded, the Board finds that it would be potentially prejudicial to the Veteran for the Board to consider these derivative claims prior to the determination of such other claim.  Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993).  Therefore, a decision on the issue of entitlement to SMC must be deferred until after the outcome of the TDIU claim.

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date than December 21, 2022, for eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is remanded.

The Board finds that the claim for an earlier effective date for basic eligibility for DEA benefits is inextricably intertwined with the resolution of the remanded issue as the effective date for the assignment of DEA benefits is predicated on the effective date of TDIU.  The appropriate remedy where a pending claim is inextricably intertwined with a claim currently on appeal is to defer the claim on appeal pending the adjudication of the inextricably intertwined claim.  Harris v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?180?(1991).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Refer the issue of entitlement to?TDIU, prior to December 21, 2022, pursuant to?38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b), to the Director of the Compensation Service for consideration.  Send the Director the entire claims file.  If the Director finds that the Veteran is not entitled to?TDIU?pursuant to?38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b), the Director should issue a memorandum explaining the reasons for that decision and a summary of the evidence considered.
