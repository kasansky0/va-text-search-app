REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1973 to August 1976 and from June 1978 to February 1982.

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), creates a new framework of review for veterans disagreeing with VA's decision on their claim. This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from two AMA rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in November 2023 and December 2023.

In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ deferred addressing whether new and relevant evidence was submitted to readjudicate the claims for service connection for diabetes type II, a psychiatric disorder, retinopathy, and a stroke; the AOJ noted that the deferment was based on the need for further development. The AOJ also found that new and relevant evidence was submitted to readjudicate the claim for service connection for a pre-existing head injury but denied the claim on the merits. Further development for the four outstanding claims occurred when VA issued a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity Memo in December 2023. 

In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence was received to readjudicate the claims for service connection for a psychiatric disorder, diabetes mellitus type II, retinopathy secondary to the diabetes type II, and stroke secondary to the diabetes mellitus type II, but the AOJ denied all four claims on their merits.

In June 2024, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182) and requested Direct Review by the Board. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision to adjudicate the claim for service connection for a pre-existing head injury and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 rating decision to adjudicate the service connection claims pertaining to the psychiatric disorder, diabetes mellitus type II, retinopathy secondary to the diabetes type II, and stroke secondary to the diabetes mellitus type II. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

In the June 2024 Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182), the Veteran appealed the five instant claims in addition to claims for service connection for deep vein thrombosis, bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, and pulmonary embolism. A VA Form 10182 can only be submitted to initiate an appeal for VA decisions adjudicated in the modernized review system created by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). The claims related to deep vein thrombosis, bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, and pulmonary embolism were denied in a March 2015 rating decision in the Legacy system. The March 2015 rating decision was not appealed, and a Statement of the Case was not issued. Thus, the claims related to deep vein thrombosis, bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, and pulmonary embolism are not before the Board. The Veteran was notified that these claims were not on appeal in October 2024. See October 2024 BVA NOD Clarification Letter. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

LEGAL AUTHORITY FOR SERVICE CONNECTION

Generally, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The law provides a presumption of service connection for certain diseases that are associated with exposure to herbicide agents and that become manifest within a specified time period in a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam from January 9, 1962 to May 7, 1975 or in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from April 1, 1968 to August 31, 1971, even if there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6).

If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service, certain diseases shall be service connected even though there is no record of such disease during service. 38 C.F.R. § § 3.309 (e). The diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § § 3.309 (e) shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service, except that chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, and acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after the last date on which the veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service. 38 C.F.R. § § 3.307 (a)(6)(ii). 

However, 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 provides that a rebuttal of the presumption of service connection for diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 is warranted when evidence of a nature usually accepted as competent to indicate the time of existence or inception of the disease, and medical judgment will be exercised in making determinations relative to the effect of intercurrent injury or disease. The expression "affirmative evidence to the contrary" will not be taken to require a conclusive showing, but such show as would, in sound medical reasoning and in the consideration of all evidence of record, support a conclusion that the disease was not incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (d)(1).

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether discussed in detail.  See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal). To the extent the evidence is found in "approximate balance," the Board will afford the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed, Cir. 2021) (holding that exact equipoise is not required for the benefit of the doubt to be applied, but rather the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal").

At the outset, the Board notes that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents in service.

In satisfying its duty to assist, VA attempted to verify the Veteran's service but was unable to confirm service in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) during the Vietnam Era between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971. See March 2015 VA Memo; December 2023 TERA Memo. 

The Board notes that even though the Veteran served in Korea, he was not stationed in the Korean DMZ between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971 as he served from August 1973 to August 1976 and from June 1978 to February 1982. See DD Form 214. 

The Board finds that the Veteran is not credible in reporting that he was exposed to herbicide agents in service. The first report of in-service herbicide agent exposure was in the July 2014 Fully Developed Claim, filed approximately 32 years after service separation for the purpose of compensation. Service treatment records lack any suggestion of herbicide agent exposure. The Veteran sought treatment at the VA Medical Center for several years, he had many opportunities to discuss the potential causes of his ailments, and did not attribute any of his conditions to the claimed in-service herbicide agent exposure. Additionally, the Veteran proffered no specific post-service lay statements about the claimed in-service herbicide agent exposure. See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (a lengthy period of absence of medical complaints for the claimed condition can be considered as a factor in resolving claim).

1. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type II is denied.

The Veteran generally requests service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II. He contends that the diabetes is related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents while stationed in Korea. See June 2023 Fully Developed Claim. 

As noted in the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current disability of diabetes mellitus, type II. See June 2023 VA Treatment Records. 

The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II was incurred in or etiologically related to service.

The Veteran was not exposed to herbicide agents in service so the claim for service connection for diabetes as due to the claimed in-service herbicide agent exposure is moot.

Service treatment records do not contain complaints of, treatment for, or diagnoses of diabetes. The Veteran submitted to several Reports of Medical Examinations, in March 1977, October 1978, March 1979, April 1980, all of which indicated that the heart and cardiovascular system were in normal condition. At service separation, the Veteran denied experiencing diabetes symptoms and declined a service separation examination. See February 1982 Report of Medical History (The Veteran answered "no" to frequent urination, eye trouble, and sugar in the urine); February 1982 Medical Examination from Separation/Retirement Statement of Option. The first report of diabetes of record was in August 2003 VA treatment records, approximately 21 years after service separation. The Veteran sought treatment for diabetes at VA Medical Centers for several years and the VA examiner noted that the diabetes dated back to May 2003, decades after service separation. See June 2023 VA Treatment Records (noting an onset of May 2003). Additionally, the Veteran provided no lay evidence that diabetes began in service.

While the Veteran is certainly competent to describe diabetes symptoms during and after service, competency and credibility are two separate inquiries.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997) (distinguishing between competence and weight and credibility and explaining that the "former is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while the latter is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted").  If evidence is not competent, it cannot be considered as evidence by the factfinder.  Id.  However, the mere fact that evidence is deemed competent does not mean that it must be found persuasive of a particular fact.  See Id.  If evidence is found to be competent, it is for the Board to determine what, if any, probative value to assign to that evidence.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005) (it is the responsibility of the Board to assess the probative weight of the evidence).

The Board finds that the Veteran is not credible in reporting that he experienced diabetes symptoms in service. At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran made no specific contentions about his in-service symptoms. At service separation, the Veteran denied experiencing diabetes symptoms. See February 1982 Report of Medical History. The Veteran's vague post-service contentions about the diabetes, made for the purpose of compensation, are inconsistent with the contemporaneous evidence and, therefore, are not credible. Consequently, the Board assigns no probative weight to such statements.

The Board notes that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination addressing the diabetes disability. However, the Board finds that such an examination is not required. In this regard, in determining whether the duty to assist requires that a VA medical examination be provided or medical opinion obtained with respect to a veteran's claim for benefits, there are four factors for consideration. These four factors are: (1) whether there is competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) whether there is evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or evidence establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumption period; (3) whether there is an indication that the disability or symptoms may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability; and (4) whether there otherwise is sufficient competent medical evidence of record to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4). With respect to the third factor above, the Court has stated that this element establishes a low threshold and requires only that the evidence "indicates" that there "may" be a nexus between the current disability or symptoms and the veteran's service. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

As previously explained, there is no evidence that the diabetes disability had an onset in service or that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents in service. The Veteran's mere generalized lay statements that herbicide agent exposure caused the current diabetes disability are insufficient to require the Secretary to provide an examination. See Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010). The Court has held that VA is not required to provide a medical examination when there is not credible evidence of an event, injury, or disease in service. See Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36 (2010). Therefore, the Board finds that a VA examination and/or opinion is not necessary to decide this claim.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II have not been met; thus, the claim must be denied. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for retinopathy secondary to the diabetes mellitus type II is denied.

The Veteran contends that the retinopathy was either secondary to the diabetes disability and/or caused by the claimed in-service exposure to herbicide agents. See June 2023 Fully Developed Claim; July 2023 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. 

In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current disability of retinopathy. See December 2022 VA Treatment Records.

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. In the instant decision, however, the Board has determined that the Veteran is not service connected for diabetes, so the Veteran's secondary service connection claim is moot.

As explained above, the Veteran was not exposed to herbicide agents in service so the claim for service connection for retinopathy as due to the claimed in-service herbicide agent exposure is moot.

The Veteran's retinopathy was not incurred in or etiologically related to service. Service treatment records do not contain complaints of, treatment for, or diagnoses of retinopathy. Several Reports of Medical Examinations, conducted in March 1977, October 1978, March 1979, April 1980, indicate that the eyes were in normal condition. At service separation, the Veteran denied experiencing retinopathy symptoms. See February 1982 Report of Medical History (The Veteran answered "no" to eye trouble); February 1982 Medical Examination from Separation/ Retirement Statement of Option (The Veteran declined a service separation examination). The first report of retinopathy of record was in August 2009 VA treatment records, approximately 27 years after service separation. The Veteran does not assert, and the medical evidence of record does not establish, that the retinopathy had its onset in service. The Veteran sought treatment at VA Medical Centers for years, but did not attribute the retinopathy to service or the claimed in-service herbicide agent exposure. In fact, VA treatment records indicate that the retinopathy is secondary to the Veteran's non-service-connected diabetes. 

As there is no evidence that the retinopathy disability had an onset in service or that the Veteran was exposure to herbicide agents in service. The Veteran's mere generalized lay statements that the non-service-connected diabetes or that the herbicide agent exposure caused the Veteran's current retinopathy disability are insufficient to require the Secretary to provide an examination. See Waters, 601 F.3d at 1278; Bardwell, 24 Vet. App. 36. Therefore, the Board finds that a VA examination and/or opinion is not necessary to decide this claim.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for retinopathy, secondary to the non-service-connected diabetes mellitus, type II have not been met; thus, the claim must be denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for a stroke secondary to the non-service-connected diabetes mellitus type II is denied.

The Veteran generally requests service connection for a stroke secondary to the diabetes disability. See July 2023 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim; June 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

Pertinent to a claim for service connection, such a determination requires a finding of a current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service. Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309 (1993); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992). Under applicable regulation, the term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see also Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 296 (1991); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability").

In McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007), the Court held that the requirement of the existence of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time he files his claim for service connection or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim. However, in Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013), the Court held that when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to a claimant filing a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.

In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran was treated for prevention of strokes in December 2012, but did not find that he had a current disability.

The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran has a current disability of a stroke. The Veteran has not been diagnosed with stroke during the pendency of this appeal stream. The last documented stroke in the VA treatment records occurred in September 2005, decades before the instant appeal stream began. The Veteran was prescribed medication to manage this condition. The Veteran had an active prescription until December 2012, almost 12 years prior to when the instant claim for service connection was filed in July 2023. The Veteran has provided no private treatment records establishing a current disability. 

As the Veteran does not have a current disability, VA is not required to provide a VA examination. See McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); Bardwell, 24 Vet. App. 36.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for stroke, secondary to the non-service-connected diabetes mellitus, type II have not been met; thus, the claim must be denied. 

3. Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder (previously claimed as depression) is denied.

The Veteran generally requests service connection for depression. See July 2023 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.

In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current psychiatric disability diagnosed as depression. See June 2023 VA Treatment Records (depression diagnosis). 

The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the current psychiatric disability was incurred in or etiologically related to service. 

Service treatment records do not contain complaints of, treatment for, or diagnoses of any psychiatric disorder. Several Reports of Medical Examinations, conducted in March 1977, October 1978, March 1979, April 1980, indicate that the Veteran's psychiatric and neurological systems were in normal condition. At service separation, the Veteran denied experiencing psychiatric symptoms, including frequent trouble sleeping, depression or excessive worry, loss of memory or amnesia, nervous trouble of any sort, and periods of unconsciousness. See February 1982 Report of Medical History; February 1982 Medical Examination from Separation/ Retirement Statement of Option (The Veteran declined a service separation examination). The first report of depression of record was in August 2003 VA treatment records, approximately 21 years after service separation. The Veteran sought treatment at VA Medical Centers for years, but did not attribute the depression to service. The Veteran claimed that his job and impotency contributed to his depression. 

The Board finds that the Veteran is not credible in reporting that he experienced depression symptoms in service. The Veteran made no specific contentions about his in-service symptoms. At service separation, the Veteran denied experiencing psychiatric symptoms. See February 1982 Report of Medical History. The Veteran's vague post-service contentions about the depression, made for the purpose of compensation, are inconsistent with the contemporaneous evidence and, therefore, are not credible. Consequently, the Board assigns no probative weight to such statements.

As there is no evidence that the depression disability had an onset in service or that the Veteran was exposure to herbicide agents in service. The Veteran's mere generalized lay statement that service caused the Veteran's current depression is insufficient to require the Secretary to provide an examination. See Waters, 601 F.3d at 1278; Bardwell, 24 Vet. App. 36. Therefore, the Board finds that a VA examination and/or opinion is not necessary to decide this claim. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for depression have not been met; thus, the claim must be denied.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a pre-existing head injury is denied.

The Veteran contends that he entitled to service connection for a head injury but proffers no specific service connection theory. See July 2023 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.

A veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto and was not aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1111. Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (b).

A preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active service where there is an increase in disability during such service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306; see Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Clear and unmistakable evidence (obvious or manifest) is required to rebut the presumption of aggravation where the pre-service disability underwent an increase in severity during service.

Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306. In explaining the meaning of an increase in disability, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that "temporary or intermittent flare-ups during service of a preexisting injury or disease are not sufficient to be considered 'aggravation in service' unless the underlying condition, as contrasted to symptoms, is worsened." Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1992); see also Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (explaining that, for non-combat veterans, a temporary worsening of symptoms due to flare ups is not evidence of an increase in disability). However, the increase need not be so severe as to warrant compensation. Browder v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 204, 207 (1991).

Of note is that the burdens and evidentiary standard to determine whether conditions noted at entrance into service were aggravated by service are different than the burdens and evidentiary standard to determine whether conditions not noted at entrance into service were aggravated. 

If a preexisting condition was not noted at service entrance, the government must show by clear and unmistakable evidence that (1) the veteran's disability existed prior to service and (2) that the pre-existing disability was not aggravated during service. If the government meets this burden, the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C. § 1111 is rebutted, and the claimant is not entitled to service-connected benefits. If the government fails to rebut the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C. § 1111, the claim becomes one for direct service connection. See Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1097.

In this case, the Veteran's service entrance examination is not of record. Thus, the burden is on VA to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that (1) the veteran's disability existed prior to service and (2) that the pre-existing disability was not aggravated during service.

In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran had a pre-existing head injury prior to entering service. See March 1977 Report of Medical Examination (noting that the Veteran sustained a skull fracture in 1968, approximately 5 years prior to entering service). The question before the Board is whether the pre-existing disability was not aggravated during service by clear and convincing evidence.

The Board finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the pre-existing head injury was not aggravated during service. Upon review of the service treatment records, there are no complaints of, treatment for, or diagnoses of any head injury. Several Reports of Medical Examinations, conducted in March 1977, October 1978, March 1979, April 1980, indicate that the Veteran's head was in normal condition. At service separation, the Veteran denied experiencing a head injury or any symptoms See February 1982 Report of Medical History. The Veteran did not provide any lay or medical evidence indicating that the pre-exiting head injury was aggravated during service. As a result, VA is unable to rebut the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C. § 1111 so the claim becomes one for direct service connection.

The Veteran does not have a current head injury disability. The Veteran has not been diagnosed with a head disability during the pendency of this appeal stream. There is also no evidence that there is an impairment in earning capacity resulting from a head disability. See Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225; Saunders, 886 F.3d 1356.

As the Veteran does not have a current disability, VA is not required to provide a VA examination. See McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); Bardwell, 24 Vet. App. 36.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for a pre-existing head injury have not been met; thus, the claim must be denied.
