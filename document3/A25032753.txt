ORDER

Service connection for major depressive disorder (MDD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's MDD is related to service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for MDD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marines Corp from March 1989 to December 1992. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.  

In May 2024, the Veteran requested higher-level review (HLR) of the August 2023 rating decision. See May 2024 VA Form 20-0996. An August 2024 rating decision did not identify an error on HLR and continued the denial of service connection for MDD.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Generally, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is caused or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires competent and credible evidence demonstrating: (1) a current disability; (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) the current disability was either (a) caused or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Service connection for MDD. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for MDD, asserting that his MDD began as a result of the racial prejudice and the resulting interpersonal difficulties he experienced during service and is related to his service-connected disabilities. See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; May 2024 VA Form 20-0996; August 2024 VA Form 10182. 

The AOJ found the Veteran has a current disability, as the evidence shows he is diagnosed with MDD, and the Veteran has service-connected disabilities of tinnitus, tooth scar, right hand scar, and left mandibular fracture. See August 2023 Rating Decision; August 2024 Rating Decision. These findings are binding on the Board. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

The Veteran asserts that in-service racial prejudice, in addition to the separation from his home and family for the first time, caused him to experience loneliness and sadness that persisted throughout service and after he separated from service. See May 2023 VA Examination. The Veteran stated that he served as an administrative clerk, but he was transferred three times during his 3 years and 9 months of service. Id. The Veteran reported he started drinking alcohol during service as a coping mechanism for his loneliness and sadness. Id. The Veteran stated that his alcoholism also acts as a stressor for his MDD. Id. The Veteran indicated that the noise in his ears caused by service-connected tinnitus is calmed by drinking alcohol, and his tinnitus worsened after retirement because he spends more time alone, so the Veteran increased his drinking after retirement, potentially worsening his MDD. Id. Thus, the Veteran's statements indicate his loneliness during service caused MDD, and drinking alcohol is a coping mechanism for the Veteran to manage the symptoms of his MDD and tinnitus, but drinking alcohol is also a stressor for the Veteran's MDD. Id. 

Veterans are competent to provide evidence of that which they experience, including symptoms and medical history. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Lay people are competent to describe visible or otherwise observable symptoms of disability. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The Veteran is competent to report that he became lonely and sad during service due to racial prejudice, he was transferred three times during service, he began drinking to help him cope with his circumstances, and his depression continued after service. The Veteran is also competent to report that his tinnitus worsened after he retired, and drinking alcohol calms the noise of his tinnitus, so the Veteran's drinking also worsened after he retired. If lay evidence is competent, the Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007). The Veteran's competent statements are consistent with other evidence that indicates the Veteran's MDD is at least as likely as not related to the racial prejudice and interpersonal difficulties the Veteran experienced during service and the coping mechanism of alcoholism that he developed as a result. The Veteran's competent lay statements are therefore credible and constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim.

Service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to MDD. See STRs received February 1997. Therefore, STRs do not weigh in favor of or against service connection for MDD. 

Military personnel records support the Veteran's lay statements indicating he became depressed during service as a result of loneliness prompted by racial prejudice and interpersonal difficulties with the Veteran's fellow service members. The Veteran's Form DD214 reflects his military occupational specialty as an administrative clerk and the three unit transfers described by the Veteran, as well as the completion of an alcohol drug subsistence abuse program in April 1991. See MPRs received January 2022. Thus, the Veteran's statements that he felt lonely and depressed as a result of the racial prejudice he experienced from his fellow service members are consistent with the Veteran's personnel records showing the Veteran served as an administrative clerk who was transferred three times during a three-year period. The Board must consider the Veteran's lay statements as they relate to the places, types, and circumstances of his service. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Therefore, records are consistent with the Veteran's statements that he began drinking during service. Id. Accordingly, personnel records constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the Veteran's claim.

VA treatment records weigh in favor of the Veteran's claim. See CAPRI received May 2023; CAPRI received June 2023. February 2024. A February 2023 primary care visit noted the Veteran's reported chronic fatigue and loss of interest in things he used to enjoy, and the Veteran's screenings for depression and alcoholism were positive. See CAPRI received May 2023. The Veteran reported he was ready to quit drinking alcohol, because his alcoholism had been worsening ever since service, and he consumed 18 beers per day in order to sleep at night, but he still frequently awoke throughout the night. Id. The Veteran was referred to the Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program (BHIP) for treatment of severe recurrent MDD without psychotic features, unspecified anxiety disorder, and unspecified alcohol abuse with intoxication. Id. At his first BHIP session in March 2023, the Veteran reported that he was transferred three times during service. Id. The BHIP provider prescribed buspirone and naltrexone to help with alcohol cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Id. In April 2023, the Veteran's depression and anxiety symptoms were severe, but the Veteran remained sober. Id. In May 2023, the BHIP provider called the Veteran to attempt to fill an open appointment in the provider's schedule, but the Veteran could not attend because he was traveling, though the Veteran indicated he was experiencing depression and anxiety. See CAPRI received June 2023. Thus, VA treatment records support the Veteran's competent, credible lay statements and show that his MDD is a result of the racial prejudice the Veteran experienced during service. Accordingly, VA treatment records constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the Veteran's claim.

VA treatment records were submitted outside the evidentiary window, so the Board acknowledges there may be additional medical evidence supporting the Veteran's assertions that his MDD is related to service or to service-connected disabilities. However, as this decision constitutes a grant of the benefit sought on appeal, the Board need not remand to afford the AOJ an opportunity to review those records. 

A May 2023 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with mild, late onset, persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress and moderate, persistent major depressive episodes. See May 2023 VA Examination. The examiner's comments to the diagnosis indicate that there is "...evidence of long standing depression which started in the military and has continued for the past 40 years." Id. Thus, the May 2023 VA examiner's diagnostic impression is consistent with the Veteran's statements indicating MDD onset as a result of racial prejudice and interpersonal problems during service and therefore is related to service. The opinion is based on an in-person examination and a review of the Veteran's lay statements, STRs, and VA treatment records. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-304 (2008). The opinion is also consistent with the other probative evidence of record. Accordingly, the May 2023 VA examination constitutes highly probative evidence weighing in favor of a finding that the Veteran's MDD is related to service. 

A May 2023 VA medical opinion found the Veteran's MDD is less likely than not related to his service-connected tinnitus. See May 2023 VA Examination. The rationale emphasized that the Veteran's STRs are silent for complaints, diagnoses, or treatment related to depression as a result of tinnitus. Id. The rationale noted that tinnitus was not mentioned in the Veteran's mental health treatment records. Id. The examiner relied on the absence of documented complaints and treatment related to MDD during or after service to support the Veteran's contentions. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Consequently, the opinion's rationale is inadequate. The examiner also did not opine as to whether the Veteran's MDD is directly related to service. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 302-304 (2008). The opinion is inconsistent with the probative evidence of record. Therefore, the May 2023 VA opinion is afforded minimal probative weight.

July 2023 VA medical opinions found the Veteran's MDD is less likely than not related to his service-connected tooth scar or his service-connected left mandibular fracture. See July 2023 VA Examination. The rationales emphasized there are no indications of a connection between MDD and the Veteran's tooth scar or left mandibular fracture. Id. The rationale further explained that the Veteran has been depressed since his teenage years. Id. The July 2023 VA medical opinion indicating the Veteran's MDD onset when the Veteran was in his teenage years supports a finding that the Veteran's MDD is at least as likely as not related to service, as the record shows that the Veteran's MDD onset during his late teenage years, when he was in service. See May 2023 VA Examination. The opinion is adequate, as the examiner reviewed the May 2023 in-person examination, STRs, VA treatment records, and the Veteran's lay statements. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-304 (2008). The opinion is consistent with the other probative evidence that indicates the Veteran's MDD is the result of the interpersonal difficulties and racial prejudice he experienced during service. Consequently, the July 2023 VA medical opinions weigh in favor of the Veteran's claim. 

One of the documents in the Veteran's claims file appears to be a July 2023 VA medical opinion, which may pertain to the Veteran's MDD, but the document is corrupted and cannot be opened. Accordingly, the Board acknowledges there may be additional medical evidence supporting the Veteran's assertions that his MDD is related to service or to service-connected disabilities. However, as this decision constitutes a grant of the benefit sought on appeal, the Board need not remand to afford the AOJ an opportunity to review those records. 

For the above reasons, the probative evidence weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's MDD developed as a result of the racial prejudice and interpersonal difficulties the Veteran experienced during service. Service connection for MDD is therefore warranted. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
