ORDER

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right foot disorder, status post intractable plantar keratosis with scar, is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for insomnia is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

The Veteran's right foot disorder most nearly approximates that of a moderate foot disability than a moderately severe or severe foot disability. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right foot disorder, status post intractable plantar keratosis with scar are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107;?38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.59, 4.71a Diagnostic Code 5284.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1984 to April 1992. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for insomnia any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

At the outset, the Board notes that in addition to the matters being remanded the January 2024 NOD appealed the issues of entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches and entitlement to an increased rating for labral tear, listed as from a June 2023 rating decision. However, as the June 2023 rating decision deferred the issues of service connection for migraine headaches and an increased rating for labral tear, these issues remained opened at the time of the June 2023 rating decision. Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over these issues.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right foot disorder, status post intractable plantar keratosis with scar, is denied.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where entitlement to compensation has already been established, and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Although a rating specialist is directed to review the recorded history of a disability in order to make a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994); 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. 

Staged ratings are, however, appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. The relevant focus for adjudicating an increased rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim. See generally Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria."). Hyphenated codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional code to identify the basis for the rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. §4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing for pain on both active and passive motion in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing, and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint.

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which relate to painful motion, are not limited to arthritis, and must be considered when raised by the claimant or when reasonably raised by the record. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011). The Court has held the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 are also not limited to the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities under diagnostic codes predicated on range of motion measurements. See Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346 (2016).

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the Veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for his right foot disorder, as his conditioned has worsened. 

The Veteran's right foot disorder is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a Diagnostic Code 5284. This disorder is rated by analogy as it is not specifically listed in the rating schedule; it is rated analogous to a disability in which not only the functions affected, but anatomical localization and symptoms are closely related. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

Under Diagnostic Code 5284, a 10 percent rating is assigned for moderate foot injury; a 20 percent rating is assigned for moderately severe foot injury; and a 30 percent rating is assigned for severe foot injury. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5284. Words such as "moderate" and "severe" are not defined in Code 5284, or elsewhere in the rating schedule in a way that might be applicable to Code 5284.

In a memorandum decision, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) observed that because the dictionary definitions of words such as "moderate" or "marked" disability "only denote comparative degree or severity, their substantive meanings vary depending on the DC in which they are used." Cross v. Wilkie, No. 19-7832, 2020 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 2197 (2020). While not binding precedent, the Board finds that observation provides helpful guidance as to terminology definitions. The Board finds that the phrase "moderately severe" denotes a level of disability that is between being "average in amount, intensity, quality, or degree" and being "very great [or] intense," such that it does not more nearly approximate the lower or the higher level of disability.

In the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning. Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015) (citing Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). The ordinary meaning of "severe" is "very great [or] intense," or "of a great degree." Id. (quoting, respectively, the NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY 1599 (3d ed. 2010) and MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARY online (internal citation omitted)). The ordinary meaning of "moderate" is "average in amount, intensity, quality, or degree." Gallagher v. Wilkie, No. 19-1855, 2020 U.S. App. Claims LEXIS 1889 (2020) (quoting NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY 1124 (3d ed. 2010).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2023 in conjunction with his claim. 

On examination, he did not have Morton's neuroma, metatarsalgia, hammer toes, hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, pes cavus, plantar fasciitis, or pes planus of the right foot. Nor was malunion or nonunion of tarsal or metatarsal bones shown. There was no evidence of bilateral weak foot. The Veteran's diagnosis was right foot injury was described as status post intractable plantar keratosis with scar. No imaging studies were performed. 

In the May 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported current symptoms of pain with ambulation which occurs daily. He stated that "he can walk 200 meters before pain starts and after 300 meters, he needs to stop to rest." See May 2023 VA Examination. The Veteran did not report having any flare-ups that impact the function of his right foot. 

On examination the examiner found no significant deformity but notes tenderness to palpation on multiple areas of the foot including the distal arch, distal dorsal metatarsal area, and the plantar surface under head of first metatarsal. Id. The Veteran does require shoe inserts as a result of his disability. The examiner found that the Veteran's right foot disorder is mild in severity, with pain as the only contributing factor of the disability, and pain on weight-bearing. The examiner reported no functional loss during flare-ups or after repeated use over time. Lastly, the examiner found that the Veteran would not be equally well served by an amputation. See Id.  

After review of the evidence delineated above, the Board finds that the Veteran's?right foot disorder?most closely approximates a 10 percent rating.

Here, the May 2023 VA examination shows the Veteran's right foot disability symptoms include pain with walking, weight-bearing, and tenderness to palpation on multiple areas of the foot including the distal arch, distal dorsal metatarsal area, and the plantar surface under head of first metatarsal.

Moreover, during the May 2023 VA examination, the Veteran describes right foot disorder symptoms as "[r]ight foot ache with ambulation." He also did not report having any flare-ups that impact the function of his left foot. Furthermore, VA treatment records during the allowed evidentiary period do not show the Veteran actively sought regular treatment for his right foot pain outside of receiving shoe inserts. Consequently, the Board finds that the evidence does not support the finding of "moderately severe" or "severe" foot injury, but that symptoms of the Veteran right foot disability more nearly approximates moderate symptoms. As such, a 10 percent rating is appropriate. 

In reaching this determination, the Board acknowledges that VA is required "to discount beneficial medication effects when relevant rating criteria do not specifically contemplate medication use." Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025). The record here does not indicate that the Veteran takes medicine to address the symptoms of his right foot disability. 

Accordingly, the claim for an evaluation in excess of 10 percent is denied. 

The Board further finds that a higher or separate rating for the Veteran's right foot disability is not warranted under any other Code. The evidence shows the Veteran does not have plantar fasciitis (5269), flatfoot (Code 5276), bilateral weak foot (Code 5277), claw foot (Code 5278), metatarsalgia (Code 5279), hallux valgus (Code 5280), hallux rigidus (Code 5281), hammer toe (Code 5282), or malunion or nonunion of tarsal or metatarsal bones (Code 5283).

Finally, neither the record nor the Veteran's lay assertions reflect that his right foot disability, alone or in tandem with other service-connected disabilities, renders him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation. Accordingly, the Board finds that a total disability rating claim based upon individual unemployability is not part and parcel of the Veteran's claim for a higher rating. See Rice v. Shinseki,?22?Vet. App.?447, 452-53?(2009). Moreover, the Veteran has not raised any other issues (e.g., separate or extraschedular ratings), nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin,?28?Vet. App.?366?(2017).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for insomnia is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his insomnia is related to active service. The Veteran's VA medical records indicate that he has a diagnosis of insomnia. However, the record lacks a VA examination providing an etiological and nexus opinion. The Board is unable to make a fully informed decision. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). The Secretary is required to "make reasonable efforts" to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate his or her claim for benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A. This includes, among other things, a duty to provide a thorough and contemporaneous medical examination or obtain a medical opinion when either is "necessary to make a decision on the claim." 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); see also Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121, 124 (1991); 38 C.F.R. § 3.326.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the AOJ made a pre-decisional duty to assist error in failing to obtain a VA examination. The appeal is remanded for correction of this error. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination with an appropriate clinician for his insomnia. The examiner must review the entire claims file (including this remand). 

Is the Veteran's insomnia at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service?

The examiner is asked to provide a rationale to support the opinion expressed.
