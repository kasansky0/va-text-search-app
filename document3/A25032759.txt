2. The criteria for an effective date prior to September 26, 2023, for the grant of service connection for fibromyalgia have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.400(b)(2)(i).

3. The criteria for an effective date prior to September 26, 2023, for the grant of service connection for irritable bowel syndrome have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.400(b)(2)(i).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from February 2006 to November 2011.  These matters are on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 26, 2023, for the grant of service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 26, 2023, for the grant of service connection for fibromyalgia.

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 26, 2023, for the grant of service connection for irritable bowel syndrome.

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 26, 2023, for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitlement to effective dates of November 10, 2011, for the grants of service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome.  He contends that he has experienced symptoms related to these disabilities since his separation from active service.

Under the laws administered by VA, the effective date based on an initial claim for compensation is the day following separation from active service or date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

In the context of a claim to reopen after a prior final denial, the effective date is the date of receipt of the reopened claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

In January 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision which granted service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome rated as 40 percent disabling; fibromyalgia rated as 40 percent disabling; and irritable bowel syndrome rated as zero percent disabling effective September 26, 2023.  These grants increased the Veteran's combined disability rating from 90 percent to 100 percent effective September 26, 2023.  As a result, the AOJ also granted basic eligibility to DEA benefits effective September 26, 2023.

A review of the record reveals that September 26, 2023, is the date of receipt for the Veteran's initial claims of service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and a stomach condition.  There are no unadjudicated claims of entitlement to service connection for these disabilities that were received prior to September 26, 2023.  Therefore, September 26, 2023, is the earliest effective date available under the law for the grants of service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome.  The claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the grants of service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome are denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.400(b)(2)(i).

Since eligibility for DEA benefits is predicated on a finding of permanent and total disability, the Board also cannot assign an effective date earlier than September 26, 2023, for the establishment of basic eligibility for DEA benefits as a matter of law.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.807 (for the purposes of DEA benefits as applicable to this case, basic eligibility exists if a veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and has a permanent and total service-connected disability).  Based on the above, the Veteran did not have a permanent and total service-connected disability prior to 

(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)?

September 26, 2023, the effective date the Veteran achieved a combined 100 percent disability rating.
