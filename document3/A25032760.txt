DOCKET NO. 220311-299642
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on September 2, 2019, Claim ID: 302119600073241000, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) was received from a billing company that did not furnish the underlying non-VA medical services in question.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal are met, as a valid VA Form 10182 requesting Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) review of the issue of entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA medical services (Claim ID: 302119600073241000) has not been received.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a June 2021 determination made by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

Dismissal

In March 2022, the Board received a VA Form 10182 by Benefit Recovery Business Associates (Benefit Recovery) electing the Direct Review docket to review the July 2021 decision denying payment for medical care provided to the Veteran on September 2, 2019, due to lack of an authorization number.

The Board finds that Benefit Recovery is not a proper claimant that may file a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement.  38?C.F.R. §?20.204 (a Notice of Disagreement may be filed by a claimant or by his or her representative if a proper Power of Attorney is on record or accompanies such Notice of Disagreement). 

"Claimant" is generally defined under VA regulations as a person who filed a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA.  38?C.F.R. §?20.3(f), (g).  Under Part 17 of the regulations, claimants for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services for unauthorized treatment may include the veteran who received the services; the hospital, clinic, or community resource which provided the services; or a person other than the veteran who paid for the services.  38?C.F.R. §?17.123. 

When viewed in context of authorized non-VA medical services, health care providers include entities authorized to furnish medical services to covered veterans that enter bid contracts to establish networks of health care providers.  See generally 38?U.S.C. §?1703(c), (h); 38?C.F.R. §§?17.4005, 17.4030.  There is no indication under the applicable law and regulations that a non-veteran entity that did not furnish the underlying medical services may be considered a claimant. 

The record does not reflect that Benefit Recovery is a health care provider as described in the regulations or that Benefit Recovery provided the underlying treatment on September 2, 2019, associated with a claim for payment for the authorized non-VA medical services.  Indeed, the non-VA medical provider for this episode of care is Baptist Medical Healthcare (BMC) - Attala.  See July 2021 VHA Decision.  Notably, Benefit Recovery is not a representative of the Veteran.  See 38?C.F.R. §§?14.627, 14.629. 

The Board therefore finds that the March 2022 VA Form 10182 filed by Benefit Recovery did not initiate appellate review.  See 38?U.S.C. §?7105(a), (b)(2)(A) (notices of disagreement shall be in writing, shall identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees, and may be filed by the claimant, the claimant's legal guardian, or such accredited representative, attorney, or authorized agent as may be selected by the claimant or legal guardian.); 38?C.F.R. §§?20.202(a), 20.204.

In sum, Benefit Recovery is not a proper appellant and may not initiate an appeal; therefore, the March 2022 appeal regarding entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA treatment provided to Veteran on September 2, 2019, is dismissed.
