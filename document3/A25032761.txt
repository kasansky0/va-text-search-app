ORDER

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for right hip pain is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had bilateral hearing loss eligible for service connection under VA criteria at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 2002 to August 2008 and from January 2010 to March 2024, to include service in Afghanistan from February 2007 through May 2007 during the Persian Gulf War.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the service connection claim for bilateral hearing loss, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. Because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for right hip pain, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if it is shown that the Veteran suffers from a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation during active service of a preexisting injury or disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994). 

Diseases of the nervous system, including sensorineural hearing loss, are listed among the "chronic diseases" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a); therefore, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) applies. See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271 (2015). Where the evidence shows a "chronic disease" in service or "continuity of symptoms" after service, the disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service. For the showing of "chronic" disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. With chronic disease as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service-connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally, a showing of "continuity of symptoms" after service is required for service connection.

To establish service connection, there must be a competent diagnosis of a current disability; medical or, in certain cases, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and competent evidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability. Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 252 (1999); see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

Competent medical evidence is evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. Competent medical evidence may also include statements conveying sound medical principles found in medical treatises. It also includes statements contained in authoritative writings, such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1). 

Competent lay evidence is any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). This may include some medical matters, such as describing symptoms or relating a contemporaneous medical diagnosis. Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372.

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is "nearly equal" or in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether most of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2022).

1. Service connection for bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral hearing disability from noise exposure or acoustic trauma during active air service.

Sensorineural hearing loss is considered by VA to be an organic disease of the nervous system. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Impaired hearing is considered a disability for VA purposes when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss under VA criteria and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran's most recent VA hearing loss examination was in January 2024. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran experienced subjective symptoms of having to ask people to talk louder. He will miss certain sounds and have to turn volume up louder. Hearing in conversations, communication with family, and at work is difficult. The Veteran reported sometimes having to talk too loudly to hear himself. However, at this examination the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of hearing loss by VA criteria. Further, despite the Veteran's subjective symptoms of hearing loss, treatment records do not contain a diagnosis of hearing loss by VA criteria.

The Veteran has had several VA hearing loss examinations, and none of them meet VA criteria for hearing loss disability service connection:

The Veteran's audiology assessments of record found the following puretone threshold levels and Maryland CNC test results:

?? ?? 	HERTZ

?? 1/8/2024	500?? 	1000?? 	2000?? 	3000?? 	4000?? 	CNC

RIGHT?? 	 20	? 20	 20	 15	 15	100%

LEFT?? 	 20	 20	 20	 15	 30	100%

A review of service treatment records also fails to reflect hearing loss under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

None of the Hearing loss examinations of record qualifies for hearing loss service connection based on VA rating criteria. The Veteran may have hearing loss at a level that is not considered to be a disability for VA purposes. In other words, the Veteran may have impaired hearing, but it does not meet the criteria to be considered a disability for VA purposes. 

Without competent evidence of a diagnosis, service connection cannot be awarded. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) ("In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim."); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (holding that service connection requires a showing of current disability). There is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, service connection for hearing loss must be denied. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to service connection for right hip pain is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he has right hip pain is secondary to service-connected low back strain and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.

The AOJ denied service connection based on the February 2024 VA Hip and Thigh Conditions examination which diagnosed no hip disability. At that examination the Veteran reported he was having a burning sensation that was radiating from his lower back into his hips. He was seen and a nerve ablation was recommended in 2022 at L3-4 and L4-5. He reports afterwards he had pain sensation in both buttock areas when anything would touch for about 3 months. The Veteran reported having intermittent burning sensation into both hips along with some numbness and tingling. At a minimum this suggests he has symptoms that result in functional impairment. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.")

The issue of entitlement to service connection for right hip pain is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the May 2024 rating decision on appeal. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) did not obtain a VA opinion prior to the May 2024 rating decision on appeal regarding whether right hip pain is separate and distinct from the bilateral sciatic radiculopathy. If the condition is separate, the examiner should opine as to whether it is caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected low back strain and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. However, based on the evidence associated with the claims file prior to the May 2024 rating decision, the Board finds that a VA examination/medical opinion is required to determine whether right hip pain is caused or aggravated by service-connected disabilities.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Forward the claims file to an appropriate examiner to provide an addendum opinion on the nature and etiology of any left hip disability. The Veteran should receive another in-person VA examination if the clinician deems it necessary. After reviewing the claims file, the examiner should offer the following opinion: 

a)	Does the Veteran have a right hip disability that is separate and distinct from the right lower extremity radiculopathy?

b)	If there is a separate disability, opine as to whether the Veteran's right hip disability is at least as likely as not (nearly equal) related to the service-connected low back disability and/or bilateral radiculopathy, to include any changes in posture and gait? 

c)	If there is a separate disability, opine as to whether the Veteran's right hip disability is at least as likely as not (nearly equal) aggravated by service-connected low back disability and/or bilateral radiculopathy, to include any changes in posture and gait.

A complete rationale for all opinions is required.
