2. In a February 2024 rating decision, service connection was granted for right knee instability effective June 29, 2023.

3. The Veteran was diagnosed with instability of the right knee on July 20, 2023.

4. The Veteran's right knee extension has not been limited to 15 degrees.

5. The Veteran's right knee instability does not require a prescribed assistive device or bracing for ambulation.

6. The Veteran's scar of the right knee has not been painful or unstable, and does not cover an area of 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from June1963 to July 1989

In January 2024 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a December 2023 decision.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior December 2023 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 decision [and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window].  

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision, which was subject to higher-level review in the February 2024 decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the December 2023 AOJ decision cannot be considered by the Board in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Notably, in a February 2025 correspondence, VA informed the Veteran that he had the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year of the original AOJ decision or within 60 days of the date that VA received his VA Form 10182, whichever was later.

The Veteran did not respond to this correspondence and 60 days has passed since the Veteran submitted his Notice of Disagreement. As a result, the appeal remains in the Direct Review Lane.

                                              Earlier Effective Dates

Laws and Regulations

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency, and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be on the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C.§ 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.400(b)(2). If a claim is reviewed at the request of the claimant more than one year after the effective date of a liberalizing law, benefits may be authorized for a period of one year prior to the date of receipt of such request. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a)(2).

The assignment of an effective date for an award of an increased disability rating is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim or a claim reopened after final adjudication of compensation will be the date entitlement arose, or the date claim was received, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Generally, the effective date for the award of an increased evaluation cannot be earlier than the date VA received the claim resulting in that award. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R.§ 3.400 (o)(1).

An effective date may be assigned on the date that an increase in disability occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date. 38 C.F.R.§ 3.400 (o)(2).

Until recently, VA's administrative claims process recognized both formal and informal claims. See Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 416 (1999); Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (amending, inter alia, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, entitled "Informal claims").

Prior to March 24, 2015, 38 C.F.R. § 3.157 (b)(1) provided that, in certain circumstances, a VA report of examination or hospitalization for a previously established service-connected disability "will be accepted as the date of receipt of a [n informal] claim" for an increased evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.157 (b)(1) (2014) (repealed by 79 Fed. Reg. at 57,696) (effective March 24, 2015); see Pacheco v. Gibson, 27 Vet. App. 21, 24-30 (2014) (en banc).

The purpose of § 3.157(b)(1) was "to avoid requiring a veteran to file a formal claim for an increased disability rating where the veteran's disability [was] already service-connected and the findings of a VA report of examination or hospitalization demonstrate[d] that the disability has worsened." Massie v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 123, 132 (2011), aff'd, 724 F.3d 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A pending claim is an application, formal or informal, which has not been finally adjudicated.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (c).  The pending claims doctrine provides that a claim remains pending in the adjudication process if VA fails to act on it.  Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 422 (1999).  Raising a pending claim theory in connection with a challenge to the effective-date decision is procedurally proper.  Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 249, 255 (2007).

In regards to the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statue or regulation.  However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought.  This is determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); see also McGrath v. Gober; 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the facts found.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011).  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

Scar

In the February 2024 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for a right knee scar at an initial 10 percent evaluation, effective June 29, 2023, on the basis that it was clearly and unmistakably erroneous for the November 2023 rating decision to not grant service connection for a right knee scar disability. 

The Veteran is seeking an effective date prior to June 29, 2023, for the award of service connection for a right knee scar. The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for a right knee scar should be based upon his original claim seeking service connection for a right knee disability and that the RO failed to adequately address the scope of the Veteran's claim for a right knee disability.

On September 30, 2013, the Veteran filed his original Fully Developed Claim application, VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking service connection for a right knee disability. The Board interprets this claim to include any scars related to this disability, See, Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (the scope of a disability claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).

A March 2014 VA examination for the Veteran's right knee disability noted that the Veteran had a scar on his right knee related to his right knee surgery in 1965.

Upon review, entitlement to an earlier effective date of September 30, 2013, is warranted for entitlement to service connection for a surgical scar of the right knee.

Notably, the September 30, 2013, claim encompassed a claim for a right knee disability and the right knee disability claim also encompasses a claim for complications of that condition. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(2), Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 200 (2021).

As determined by the February 2024 rating decision, it was clearly and unmistakably erroneous for the November 2023 rating decision to not grant service connection for a right knee scar disability.

Notably, the AOJ granted service connection in the February 2024 rating decision for the right knee scar as secondary to the right knee disability. In other words, the right knee scar was found to be a complication of the right knee disability. As such, the right knee scar is also found to be part of the right knee disability claim dating back to September 2013.

As reflected above, the record also demonstrates that the Veteran has had a scar on his right knee related to his right knee surgery in 1965.

As a result, the Board concludes that an earlier effective date of September 30, 2013, is warranted for the award of service connection for a surgical scar of the right knee disability.

However, although a secondary condition may have onset before the effective date of the award for service connection for or diagnosis of the primary condition, the effective date of a secondarily service-connected disability is precluded from being before the effective date of the primary service-connected disability.  See Frost v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 131 (2017).  This is because to establish secondary service connection, it must be secondary to a disability that is already service connected. 

Therefore, as the September 30, 2013, effective date for a surgical scar of the right knee is now identical to the effective date of his primary condition of a right knee disability, an earlier effective date prior to September 30, 2013, is not warranted. 

The Board concludes that the evidence supports an earlier effective date of September 30, 2013, for the grant of service connection for a surgical scar secondary to service-connected right knee disability.

Accordingly, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of September 30, 2013, and no earlier, is warranted for the grant of service connection for a surgical scar as secondary to the service-connected right knee disability, as this was the date of receipt of the Veteran's original claim for service connection for the right knee disability.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. There is no basis for an effective date prior to September 30, 2013.

Right Knee Instability

The Veteran contends that he should be entitled to an effective date prior to June 29, 2023, for the grant of service connection for instability of the right knee. Specifically, the Veteran claims that the effective date should be on June 29, 2022, which is one year prior to the date of the Veteran's increased rating claim for his right knee disability.

However, the Board finds that an effective date prior to June 29, 2023, for the grant of service connection for instability of the right knee is not warranted as the Veteran's VA medical records within one year prior to the June 29, 2023, claim date do not establish that an earlier effective date is warranted.

On June 29, 2023, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his right knee disability via VA Form 21-526EZ.

In the February 2024 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for right knee instability at an initial 10 percent evaluation, effective June 29, 2023, on the basis that it was clearly and unmistakably erroneous for the November 2023 rating decision to not grant service connection for a right knee instability disability. 

Generally, the effective date of an award of increased compensation such as the Veteran's grant of a separate evaluation for right knee instability, is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless otherwise provided. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Entitlement arises on the date the claimant meets the basic eligibility criteria. For increased rating claims, if the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (Sept. 23, 1998). If the increase occurred more than a year prior to the claim, the effective date shall be the date of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Finally, if the increase occurs after the claim is filed, the effective date shall be the date the increase occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126-27 (1997).

An effective date earlier than June 29, 2023, is only possible in this case if the evidence establishes an increase in disability within one year prior to the date of claim, i.e. during the period between June 29, 2022, and June 29, 2023. 

The Board has reviewed the Veteran's medical records during the appeal period, including the time period one year prior to the receipt of the Veteran's June 29, 2023 increased rating claim for service-connected right knee disability and finds that the most persuasive evidence does not show that right knee instability was shown during the appeal period from June 29, 2022 or was factually ascertainable during the period one year prior to June 29, 2023, but rather, that entitlement first arose on July 2023 at the VA examination for knee and lower leg conditions.

On a March 2014 VA examination, the examiner provided a diagnosis of status post right knee surgery with joint effusion. However, the March 2014 VA examiner specifically found that the Veteran did not have instability of the right knee even upon specific testing.

The July 20, 2023, VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with instability of the right knee. Based on the findings of this VA examination, a separate 10 percent evaluation for instability of the right knee was granted in the February 2024 rating decision.

The Board finds that the July 20, 2023, VA examination report is the earliest evidence of instability.  

As such, July 20, 2023, is the date that entitlement arose. Prior to this date, the Veteran had no diagnosis or consistent report of symptoms of right knee instability to warrant service connection.

However, despite June 29, 2023, being earlier than the July 20, 2023, date that entitlement arose, the Board will not disturb the current effective date of June 29, 2023, which was the date of the Veteran's claim.

Accordingly, under the applicable regulations, June 29, 2023, the date of the Veteran's increased rating claim, is the earliest assignable date for the award of service connection for instability of the right knee.  U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

In reaching these conclusions, the benefit of the doubt has been considered. However, the evidence supports a finding that an earlier effective date is not warranted for a separate rating for right knee instability. As such, there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

                                                 Higher Ratings

Laws and Regulations

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 (2012).  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7 (2021).  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3 (2020). 

The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making a disability determination.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 (2021).  Where service connection has already been established, and increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of the disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  However, in Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999), it was held that evidence to be considered in the appeal of an initial assignment of a disability rating was not limited to that reflecting the then current severity of the disorder.  The Court also discussed the concept of the "staging" of ratings, finding that, in cases where an initially assigned disability evaluation has been disagreed with, it was possible for a veteran to be awarded separate percentage evaluations for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period.  See also Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2008).

In this case, the Veteran is competent to testify on factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge. Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005). He is also competent to report symptoms of his right knee and hypertension disabilities. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994). The Veteran is competent to describe his symptoms and their effects on employment or daily activities.  

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.40. Functional loss may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior in undertaking the motion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59 (discussing facial expressions such as wincing, muscle spasm, crepitation, etc.). Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  Excess fatigability and incoordination should be taken into account in addition to more movement than normal, less movement than normal, and weakened movement.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45.

The intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability.  It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  Although the first sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 refers only to arthritis, the regulation applies to joint conditions other than arthritis.  Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 3-5 (2011).

In evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, it is necessary to consider, along with the schedular criteria, functional loss due to flare-ups of pain, fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, and weakness.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).

Although pain may cause functional loss, pain itself does not constitute functional loss. Rather, pain must affect some aspect of "the normal working movements of the body," such as "excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," in order to constitute functional loss.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 38-43 (2011) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40).

Right Knee

The Veteran filed a claim for increased ratings that was received by VA in June 2023.

The Veteran currently has a right knee disability rated at 10 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 5261 based on limitation of extension and a 10 percent rating for right knee instability under Diagnostic Code 5257.

Diagnostic Code 5003 states that degenerative arthritis established by X-ray findings will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003. When the limitation of motion is not compensable under appropriate diagnostic codes, a rating of 10 percent may be applied to each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion. The limitation of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful motion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003. In the absence of limitation of motion, X-ray evidence of arthritis involving two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups, will warrant a rating of 10 percent; in the absence of limitation of motion, X-ray evidence of arthritis involving two or more major joint groups with occasional incapacitating exacerbations will warrant a 20 percent rating. The above ratings are to be combined, not added under Diagnostic Code 5003. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003, Note 1.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260, if flexion of the knee is limited to 45 degrees a 10 percent rating is in order.  If flexion of the knee is limited to 30 degrees a 20 percent rating is in order.  If flexion of the knee is limited to 15 degrees a 30 percent rating is in order. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261, if extension of the knee is limited to 10 degrees a 10 percent rating is in order.  If extension of the knee is limited to 15 degrees a 20 percent rating is in order.  If extension of the knee is limited to 20 degrees a 30 percent rating is in order. 

Diagnostic Code 5262 provides a 30 percent evaluation for shin splints requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, both lower extremities; a 20 percent rating is warranted for shin splints requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one lower extremity, a 10 percent rating is warranted for shin splints requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one or both lower extremities; and a noncompensable rating is warranted for shin splints that have treatment less than 12 consecutive months, one or both lower extremities. 

VA General Counsel has also held that separate ratings may be assigned in cases where a service-connected knee disability includes both a compensable limitation of flexion under Diagnostic Code 5260, and a compensable limitation of extension under Diagnostic Code 5261 provided that the degree of disability is compensable under each set of criteria.  VAOPGCPREC 09-04; 69 Fed. Reg. 59990 (2004).  The basis for the opinion was a finding that a limitation in planes of movement were each compensable.  Id.  

A claimant who has arthritis and instability of the knee may also be rated separately under Diagnostic Code 5003 and Diagnostic Code 5257, and rating a knee disability under both of those codes does not amount to pyramiding under 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 (2020). VAOPGCPREC 23-97 (July 1, 1997), 62 Fed. Reg. 63604 (1997); Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994).  However, a separate rating must be based on additional compensable disability.

Under the revised criteria, Diagnostic Code 5257 for recurrent subluxation and instability now provides a 30 percent rating for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation or a sprain incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation. A 20 percent rating is warranted for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. A 10 percent rating is warranted for sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.

For patellar instability under the revised Diagnostic Code 5257, a 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker. A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: A brace, cane, or walker. A 10 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker.

Under Diagnostic Code 5258, dislocated semilunar cartilage, with frequent episodes of locking, pain, and effusion into the joint, warrants a maximum 20 percent disability rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5258.

Diagnostic Code 5259, removal of semilunar cartilage, symptomatic, warrants a 10 percent rating.

For rating purposes, normal range of motion in a knee joint is from 0 to 140 degrees of flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023. The diagnosis was status post-surgery with arthropathy and joint effusion. The Veteran reported chronic right knee pain and that his right knee would give out on him. His right knee would swell if he sat too long. He did not report flare-ups of the knee. He reported functional impairment as he had pain and always had to stretch out his knee. Prolonged standing increased his pain. He had a history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the knee as his knee felt like it was going to give out when he stood or walked for long periods at a time. He had frequent effusion as his knee swelled daily. Flexion of the right knee was from 10 to 100 degrees of the right knee. There was pain with active motion and passive motion that did not cause functional loss. There was evidence of crepitus and localized tenderness. He was able to perform repetitive use testing of the right knee with no additional limitation of motion after 3 repetitions. The examiner noted that pain, weakness, incoordination, fatigability and lack of endurance did not significantly limit functional ability with repeated use over time or during flare-ups. The Veteran did not have atrophy or ankylosis. There was recurrent subluxation or persistent instability of the knee as the Veteran had a ligament tear which was successfully repaired. He did not require a prescription for use of a cane, crutches, walker or brace for ambulation. There was recurrent instability, but the Veteran did not have surgical repair for the recurrent instability. The Veteran occasionally used crutches. The Veteran's right knee disability impacted his ability to work as he was retired but reported pain and instability of the right knee with prolonged standing, walking or sitting.

Limitation of Extension

As noted above, the Veteran currently has a 10 percent evaluation for a right knee disability with limitation of extension under Diagnostic Code 5261.

The Board again notes that if extension of the knee is limited to 10 degrees a 10 percent rating is in order, if extension of the knee is limited to 15 degrees a 20 percent rating is in order and if extension of the knee is limited to 20 degrees a 30 percent rating is in order. 

Upon review of all relevant evidence of record, the Board finds that the disability picture associated with the Veteran's right knee does not meet or more nearly approximate the criteria for an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for loss of extension.

Again, the VA examination shows at worst, extension from 10 to 0 degrees as evidenced on the July 2023 VA examination. However, there is no evidence that the Veteran has had limitation of extension to 15 degrees or more. 

Additionally. the examiner noted that pain, weakness, incoordination, fatigability and lack of endurance did not significantly limit functional ability with repeated use over time or during flare-ups.

As such, the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent under Diagnostic Code 5261 is not met. 

The Board has considered the holding in DeLuca and 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, and 4.59 regarding the right knee limitation of extension. However, given that the Veteran is already being compensated for pain on motion and without evidence of other significant limitations, a disability rating in excess of 10 percent pursuant to DeLuca is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, and 4.59. The medical evidence shows that the pain on extension in the right knee is part of the current 10 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 5261. Similarly, the medical evidence does not show that the painful extension approximates a limitation of extension warranting a 20 percent rating. 

Therefore, a rating in excess of 10 percent for limitation of extension of the right knee under Diagnostic Code 5261 is not warranted.

Additionally, the Board finds that a separate initial compensable rating based on limitation of flexion is also not warranted.

As reflected above, the July 2023 VA examination demonstrated flexion from 10 to 100 degrees.

The Board again notes that if flexion of the knee is limited to 45 degrees a 10 percent rating is in order.  If flexion of the knee is limited to 30 degrees a 20 percent rating is in order.  If flexion of the knee is limited to 15 degrees a 30 percent rating is in order.

Notably, even when considering DeLuca factors, the July 2023 VA examination demonstrated limitation of flexion of 100 degrees. 

Accordingly, the limitation of flexion of the right knee does not warrant a 10 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 5260 because that amount of limitation is noncompensable.

Accordingly, the range of motion measurements did not meet the criteria for even the noncompensable ratings for flexion. As a result, a separate initial compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5260 is not warranted. 

The Board has also considered other diagnostic codes to determine if higher evaluations are warranted for the right knee disability. However, evaluation of the relevant evidence of record reflects that the record contains no evidence of ankylosis, malunion or nonunion of the tibia and fibula, or genu recurvatum. Thus, Diagnostic Codes 5256, 5262, and 5263 do not apply.

The Board also finds that a separate or higher rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Codes 5258 or 5259 as there is no evidence of a meniscus disability or meniscal surgery. 

The Board notes that the Veteran has undergone a complete repair of a ligament tear of his right knee. However, as the Veteran has a 10 percent rating for a right knee disability based, in part, on pain and limitation of motion, separate disability ratings under either Diagnostic Codes 5258 and 5259 would violate 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 and the rule against pyramiding as those codes already contemplate such manifestation. Thus, for this reason, separate ratings under these codes would violate 4.14. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence is against the assignment of a rating greater than 10 percent for a right knee disability based on limitation of extension.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (2021).

Instability

As noted above, the Veteran now has an initial 10 percent evaluation for right knee instability under Diagnostic Code 5257.

As noted above, to warrant a 20 percent disability rating under the revised criteria of Diagnostic Code 5257, there must be recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: A brace, cane, or walker.

The Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted as the record does not show that the Veteran was prescribed a brace, cane, or walker for his instability as specifically noted by the July 2023 VA examiner. 

While the examiner noted that the Veteran reported occasionally using a brace, the examiner also specifically indicated that the Veteran was not prescribed a brace, cane, or walker for his instability.

In short, the medical evidence simply does not demonstrate that the Veteran was prescribed a brace, cane, or walker for his instability.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence is against the assignment of a rating greater than 10 percent for right knee instability.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (2021).

Scar

The Veteran currently has an initial noncompensable evaluation for a scar of the right knee under Diagnostic Code 7802.

The Board notes that changes were made in the regulations governing the rating of scars on August 13, 2018. With regard to the effective date of the new criteria, VA indicated in the Supplementary Information to the Final Rule that its "intent is that the claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied." The Veteran's claim in this case was filed after the August 13, 2018, effective date of the new criteria, and therefore the Board will consider only the new criteria.

As Diagnostic Code 7800 pertains to burn scars, other scars, or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, such is inapplicable in the instant case as the Veteran's scar is on his right knee.

The Board additionally notes that while the Veteran is currently rated under Diagnostic Code 7802 for his left knee Diagnostic Codes 7801 and 7802 pertain to scars not of the head, face, or neck.

Following the August 13, 2018, changes, Diagnostic Code 7801 applies to scars associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Under Diagnostic Code 7801, qualifying scars warrant a 10 percent rating if the area or areas exceed 6 square inches (39 sq. cm). A 20 percent rating requires an area or areas exceeding 12 square inches (77 sq. cm); a 30 percent evaluation is assigned for an area or areas exceeding 72 square inches (465 sq. cm); and a 40 percent evaluation is warranted for an area or areas exceeding 144 square inches (929 sq. cm). A deep scar is one associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7801, Note 1 (2018). Since August 13, 2018, a separate evaluation may be assigned for each affected zone of the body (each extremity, anterior trunk, and posterior trunk) if there are multiple scars, or a single scar, affecting multiple zones of the body. Alternatively, if a higher evaluation would result from adding the areas affected from multiple zones of the body, a single evaluation may also be assigned under this Diagnostic Code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7801, Notes 1-2 (2021).

After the August 13, 2018, changes, Diagnostic Code 7802 applies to scars not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. It provides for a 10 percent rating for a qualifying scar involving an area or areas at least 144 sq. inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. A superficial scar is one not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802

Diagnostic Code 7804 provides that one or two scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 10 percent evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. If one or more scars are both unstable and painful, the rater is to add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. Scars evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7804, when applicable.

Diagnostic Code 7805 provides that other scars (including linear scars) and other effects of scars evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804 require the evaluation of any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-7804 under an appropriate diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. 

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a 0 percent rating for a diagnostic code, a 0 percent rating will be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran underwent VA examinations in July 2023. The examiner noted that the Veteran had a healed scar of the right knee status post right knee surgery. The scar was not painful. The Veteran had a scar on his right knee measuring 14cm x 0.2cm. The scar without underlying tissue damage measured an approximate total area of 2.8 cm squared. The Veteran's scar did not impact his ability to work. 

Based on the evidence, the Board does not find that the Veteran is entitled to an initial compensable rating for a scar of the right knee.

As noted above, under Diagnostic Code 7802, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted when the area of the scar covers 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater. In this case, the record does not reflect, and the Veteran has not claimed, that the scar of his right knee covers 929 square centimeters. On the VA examination in July 2023, the examiner noted that the total area of all the related scar was not greater than 39 square cm.

As such, an initial compensable rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7802.

As the Veteran's scar is not on the face, head or neck, and is linear, Diagnostic Code 7800 does not apply in this case, and will not be discussed.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800.

Additionally, the scar was not shown to be deep and nonlinear or associated with underlying soft tissue damage to warrant consideration under Diagnostic Code 7801. Since the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effect not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Code s 7800-04 as contemplated under post-August 13, 2018, a higher rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7805. 

The Board has considered the Veteran and his representative's statements regarding the severity of the Veteran's scar. However, as lay persons, they do not have the training or expertise to render a competent opinion which is more probative than the VA examiner's findings, as this is a medical determination that is complex. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994)). Thus, the lay opinions are outweighed by the VA examiner's opinions. See id.; see also King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (affirming the Court's conclusion that the Board did not improperly discount the weight of a lay opinion in finding a medical expert's opinion more probative on the issue of medical causation).

For these reasons, the Board concludes that an initial compensable rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7802 for the Veteran's scar of the right knee, and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Hypertension

The November 2023 rating decision granted service connection for hypertension at an initial noncompensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7101, effective August 10, 2022.

Diagnostic Code 7101 provides that a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more.  A 60 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. 

In every instance where the rating schedule does not provide for a noncompensable evaluation, a noncompensable evaluation shall be assigned where the requirements for a compensable rating are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31 (2021).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023. The Veteran's treatment plan required continuous medication. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more. The Veteran's blood pressure readings were 139/90, 138/88 and 134/90. The Veteran's hypertension did not impact his ability to work. 

The Board finds that an initial compensable disability rating is not warranted for the Veteran's service-connected hypertension disability. 

As stated above, a 10 percent evaluation for hypertension under Diagnostic Code 7101 is not warranted unless his diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. 

Notably, while the Veteran's hypertension has required continuous medication, the evidence of record does not show that he has had diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more. Therefore, the Board finds entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for hypertension is not warranted.

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of the Veteran's hypertension. However, as a lay person, the Veteran and his representative do not have the training or expertise to render a competent opinion which is more probative than the VA examiner's opinions as this is a medical determination that is complex. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994)). Thus, the lay opinions are outweighed by the evidence of record, to include the VA examiner's opinions and treatment records.

Therefore, based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence is against an initial compensable rating for hypertension. The benefit of the doubt rule is not applicable. See generally Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d. 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
