REMANDED

Service connection for anxiety condition is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2004 to April 2005 and from May 2006 to August 2007.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for anxiety condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Veteran filed a claim for anxiety condition in December 2023. On the claim form, the Veteran stated that during his time serving in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2007, he slowly started to develop anxiety issues which began prior to his deployment to Afghanistan. He further indicated that one day in 2006 he was struggling with swallowing food which only worsened when deployed to Afghanistan, and he ignored it and pushed through and when he returned home it slowly got better, but over the years it comes and goes.

In February 2024, the Veteran provided a statement that while mobilizing, he was diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed Atarax, and during deployment he dealt with this anxiety on more days than not, which at times did not allow him to properly do his job. The Veteran further provided that upon completion of his deployment his conditions appeared to get better, but since 2006, he has good years and bad years, but he anxiety still hinders his career and daily life at times. 

In addition, the Board notes that the Veteran was treated for chronic fatigue syndrome while on active duty in 2006.

A VA examination was requested by the AOJ. However, it appears that the examination provider was unable to contact the Veteran, and the AOJ instead decided that an examination was not needed. The Board notes that no mention was made in the May 2024 rating decision of the Veteran failing to appear for a VA examination, but instead states that an examination and/or medical opinion based on toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) was not requested. In addition, the Veteran stated on the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), that he was not provided with a medical appointment to evaluate his condition.

In McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-83 (2006), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that an examination is required when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing an "in-service event, injury or disease," or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the current disability may be related to the in-service event, but (4) insufficient evidence to decide the case. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the McLendon elements have been met. 

The AOJ's failure to provide a VA examination constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. To ensure that VA has met its duty to assist, remand is necessary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran with a VA examination and medical opinion indicating whether it is approximately at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's anxiety condition was incurred or is otherwise related to military service.

A complete rationale, with citation to appropriate medical principles, is required.

The examiner is requested to consider any lay statements by the Veteran regarding the nature and onset of his disability, including any evidence concerning continuity of symptomatology, as he is legally permitted to report his symptoms, past medical history, and experiences.

The examiner is informed that the absence of contemporaneous service treatment records or medical records in general, standing alone, without explaining why such evidence is significant, may be considered insufficient rationale.
