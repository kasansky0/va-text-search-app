ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 30, 2022, for the award of a 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder with unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, and amphetamine-type substance induced psychotic disorder with severe amphetamine use disorder (psychiatric disorder) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 7, 2023, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his PTSD more nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas prior to August 24, 2023.

2.  The Veteran is in receipt of the earliest possible effective date for service connection for tinnitus. There is no evidence of an earlier, unadjudicated claim.

3. The Veteran's GERD was not incurred in, and is not otherwise related to, his active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for an earlier effective date of January 30, 2022, for the award of a 70 percent rating for the service-connected psychiatric disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400(o), 3.2500(h); 4.129, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

2.  The criteria for an effective date earlier than September 7, 2023, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b); 3.400, 3.2500(c) and (h).

3.  The criteria for service connection for GERD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from September 1982 to August 1985.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2024, March 2024, and April 2024 AMA rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

With regards to the claim for an earlier effective date for the award of a 70 percent rating for the service-connected psychiatric disorder, in March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2024 rating decision. In April 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2024 decision. In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision.  38?C.F.R. §§ 3.2601(f), 20.301.

Likewise, as the Veteran elected direct review on his Notice of Disagreement, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions in regard to the claim for an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for tinnitus and the claim for service connection for GERD respectively. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board also notes that in an October 2024 correspondence, after submission of his Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran informed VA that he was no longer represented by his previous representative. To date, the Veteran has not appointed a new representative.  As such, the Veteran currently appears before the Board pro se. 

Furthermore, in the May 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran indicated that he disagreed with a July 2004 rating decision that initially denied tinnitus.  However, as explained below, such decision has become final, and the May 2024 Notice of Disagreement cannot be considered a valid appeal of that decision as it was issued prior to implementation of the AMA and issued approximately 20 years prior to receipt of the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement.  To the extent the Veteran believes that the July 2004 rating decision contains clear and unmistakable error, he may file such claim on the appropriate form with the RO. 

1.  Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 30, 2022, for the award of a 70 percent rating for the service-connected psychiatric disorder.

The Veteran contends that the effective date of the award of the 70 percent rating for his psychiatric disorder should be the date service connection was effectuated.  For the reasons that follow, the Board agrees and finds that an earlier effective date of January 30, 2022, is warranted. 

Generally, for increased compensation claims, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1); VAOPGCPREC 12-98, 63 Fed. Reg. 56,703 (Oct. 22, 1998). Date of receipt means the date on which VA received a claim, information, or evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).

An exception to this rule applies under circumstances where evidence demonstrates a factually ascertainable increase in disability during the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(3).  In that situation, the law provides that the effective date of the award shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date. Id.; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

Additionally, for AMA appeals, as here, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h) further governs the assignment of effective dates. Under that provision, determining the date of a veteran's claim depends on whether a veteran continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). With Supplemental Claims received more than one year after notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the Supplemental Claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2). The AMA requires that claims be submitted on the proper form. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i).

Therefore, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of a case: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)); or (3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)). Harper, 10 Vet. App. at 126.  Under the AMA, a veteran may preserve a claim date by continuously pursuing the claim.  Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96 (2024).

A "claim" or "application" is defined by VA regulation as "a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit."  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (prior to 2015).  An informal claim is "[a]ny communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits...." and must identify the benefit sought.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (prior to 2015).  In 2015, VA amended the regulations to require submissions on standardized claim forms.  As the Veteran's claim was received after March 2015, this change applies to the Veteran's appeal.

A review of the record shows that the Veteran has continuously pursued his initial claim for his psychiatric disorder.  Specifically, the Veteran filed a formal claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder in January 2023, which was granted in a May 2023 rating decision at which time a 30 percent rating was assigned.  The RO ultimately assigned a January 30, 2022, effective date for service connection based on receipt of an Intent to File on such date, within one year of his January 2023 claim.  See July 2023 rating decision.  Thereafter, the Veteran filed a request for Higher-Level Review in June 2023 disagreeing with the 30 percent rating assigned, which was subsequently denied in a July 2023 rating decision.  On August 24, 2023, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim requesting a higher rating of 70 percent effective from the date service connection was granted.  In a January 2024 rating decision, the RO awarded an increased 70 percent rating but assigned the effective date of August 24, 2023, the date VA received his Supplemental Claim.  In March 2024, the Veteran filed a Request for Higher-Level Review contending that the 70 percent rating should be effective from the date service connection was granted.  In the April 2024 rating decision on appeal, the RO denied to assign an earlier effective date.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued the issue of an increased rating for his psychiatric disorder since service connection was granted.  Thus, the earliest possible effective date is January 30, 2022, the date service connection was awarded. 

Thus, the issue turns on when entitlement to a 70 percent rating arose.

After reviewing the lay and medical evidence of record, and resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder was of the same severity since service connection was granted to August 24, 2023, the date the RO granted a 70 percent rating.

In this regard, the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has suffered from approximately the same or similar symptoms both prior to and after August 24, 2023, and that such symptoms have resulted in the same or similar social and occupational impairment.  VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran experienced issues with anger and verbal outbursts as early as 2012.  The May 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran exhibited loud and angry speech, and at the December 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he had recently punched someone in a restaurant.  Both prior to and after August 2023, the Veteran experienced relatively severe social impairment as he reported at both the May 2023 examination and December 2023 examination that he did not have any close friends.  See also August 2023 correspondence from the Veteran (endorsing multiple psychiatric symptoms).  He also reported at the May 2023 examination that he generally avoided people.  Likewise, both the May 2023 and December 2023 examinations indicate that the Veteran experienced the same or similar occupational impairment from his psychiatric symptoms.  See May 2023 VA examination (discussing the Veteran's occupational history and noting fair to poor judgment); December 2023 VA examination (discussing the Veteran's occupational history). 

Furthermore, the Veteran has consistently reported that his psychiatric symptoms and functioning have been approximately the same since approximately 2011/2012.  See May 2023 VA examination; September 2023 Social Security Administration record.  Such is supported by 2012 VA treatment records as well as a March 2023 statement from the Veteran's sibling. 

Although the May 2023 VA examiner noted significantly less symptoms than the August 2023 examiner, the symptoms noted do not appear to necessarily encompass the history reported by the Veteran and noted by the examiner.  For example, although the examiner noted that the Veteran had no close friends and avoided people, she did not note any symptoms in regard to establishing or maintaining relationships.  See also August 2023 Statement in Support of Claim (reporting a number of reasons why the Veteran felt the May 2023 examination was inadequate). 

In light of the foregoing, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that his psychiatric disorder generally was of the same severity since service connection was granted to August 24, 2023, the date the RO granted a 70 percent rating.  Thus, the proper effective date is the date service connection was effectuated, January 30, 2022.  This is the effective date requested by the Veteran.  Thus, the claim for an earlier effective date is granted.

2.  Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 7, 2023, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for tinnitus.  For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted. 

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless otherwise provided. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Additionally, a claimant may submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives a complete claim form within one year. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b); but see 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(d) (noting that § 3.155(b) does not apply to supplemental claims). If submitted in writing, the intent to file must be on a standardized form. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Further, as noted above, for AMA appeals, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h) controls the assignment of effective dates. Under that provision, the effective date will be the date VA received a veteran's initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a veteran continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). With Supplemental Claims received more than one year after notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the Supplemental Claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2). The AMA requires that claims, to include Supplemental Claims, be submitted on the proper form. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i).  Thus, under the AMA, a veteran may preserve a claim date by continuously pursuing the claim.  Calhoun, 37 Vet. App. at 96.

As explained above, a "claim" or "application" is defined by VA regulation as "a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). An informal claim is "[a]ny communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits...." and must identify the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended the regulations to require submissions on standardized claim forms. 

Turning to the record, the Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for tinnitus in December 2003 which was denied in an August 2004 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal the decision, and no new and material evidence was received within one year of its issuance.  Thus, the decision became final.

Thereafter, no formal or informal claim for tinnitus was received by the Veteran until he filed a formal claim for service connection on an Application for Disability and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526EZ) received by VA on August 24, 2023.  However, in an August 28, 2023, letter, the Veteran was informed that the claim form submitted was not the proper form for his claim for tinnitus as it was previously denied, and thus, he needed to file his claim on the proper form in order for it to be readjudicated.  Thereafter, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim on September 7, 2023, and filed a Supplemental Claim for service connection for tinnitus on September 19, 2023.  This is the claim from which the present appeal stems. 

The evidence of record does not show, and the Veteran does not contend, that he filed any formal or informal claim for service connection for tinnitus prior to March 24, 2015, or any formal claim for tinnitus after such date, that remained unadjudicated.

Although the Veteran did submit a formal claim for tinnitus that was received by VA on August 24, 2023, as noted above, such was not the proper form for the claim for tinnitus as service connection had been previously denied.  Thus, the proper form was a Supplemental Claim, which was subsequently received on September 19, 2023.  As VA regulations require claims to be submitted on the proper form, an earlier effective date of August 24, 2023, cannot be granted. 

The Board has considered the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i) that provide where a complete claim form is submitted within 60 days of an incomplete claim form as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), the effective date will be the date the incomplete claim form was received.  However, here, the August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ is not an incomplete form but rather is an incorrect form.

Additionally, the August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ cannot be considered a valid intent to file as a VA Form 21-526EZ is not the prescribed intent to file a claim form, nor does the submission fall under one of the other prescribed ways an intent to file may be submitted.  See 38 C.F.R.  § 3.155(b)(1); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(d) (noting that intent to file does not apply to supplemental claims). 

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than the current effective date of September 7, 2023, is not warranted.  Accordingly, the claim for an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for tinnitus is denied.

3.  Entitlement to service connection for GERD.

The Veteran contends that his GERD began during his active service.  For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Generally, to establish service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of 1) a current disability, 2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and 3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Turning to the evidence of record, the RO has determined that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of GERD.  Such is a favorable finding that the Board will not disturb.

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) does not show any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to GERD.  On his August 1985 Report of Medical Examination at separation all body systems were noted as normal.  Additionally, on the accompanying Report of Medical History, the Veteran reported "no" to "frequent indigestion" as well as "stomach, liver, or intestinal trouble."

The Veteran underwent a VA fee-based examination in March 2024 at which time he reported that around 1984 he began having severe heartburn with acidic matter erupting into his mouth and a burning sensation.  However, as noted above, the Veteran expressly denied experiencing indigestion and stomach issues at separation in 1985.  The Board finds this contemporaneous evidence is more probative than the statement the Veteran made decades after service. See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994) (holding that contemporaneous records can be more probative than history as reported by a Veteran). 

After examining the Veteran and considering his statements and evidence of record, the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's GERD was related to his active service.  The examiner explained that while the Veteran has a history of GERD and that post-military records note the condition, there are no STRs that note GERD.  He further noted that the Veteran noted no issues with indigestion of stomach issues at separation.  The examiner explained that without corroborating evidence it is hard to prove that the Veteran's current issues were incurred during service.  Thus, he concluded that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's GERD was related to his military service. 

The Board finds this opinion, supported by a rationale based on an accurate medical history with clear conclusions and supporting data, is highly probative.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  

While the Veteran believes his GERD is related to his service, he is not competent to provide a nexus opinion in this case.  This issue is medically complex, as it involves internal disease processes and requires knowledge of interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In sum, while the Veteran contends that his GERD had onset in service, the Board finds the contemporaneous evidence to service more probative, and the Veteran has not otherwise contended, nor does the evidence otherwise indicate, that his GERD is related in any other way to service.  Furthermore, the March 2024 VA fee-based examiner provided a negative opinion, which the Board finds is highly probative. 

Based on the foregoing, service connection for GERD is not warranted.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the persuasive evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).
