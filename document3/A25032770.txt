ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for schizophrenia is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's symptoms of his currently diagnosed chronic schizophrenia manifested within one year of his separation from active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for schizophrenia are met. 38 U.S.C. § 1151, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.384.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from February 1973 to February 1977.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2020 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO/AOJ). The Veteran appealed that decision by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal on February 22, 2021. He requested a Board hearing.

The Veteran was scheduled to appear for a Board hearing. He did not appear for the scheduled Board hearing. Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.704(d), an appellant must file a motion in writing for a new hearing within 15 days following a failure to appear for a scheduled hearing. A Motion to reschedule has not been received. Consequently, the appeal will proceed as though the request for a hearing has been withdrawn. 38 C.F.R. § 20.704(d). 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2020 AOJ decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing, i.e., after December 2, 2024.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(c).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision and prior to the date of the scheduled Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(c), 20.801.  The period to submit additional evidence has elapsed.  

1. Entitlement to Service Connection for Schizophrenia

The Veteran maintains that an acquired psychiatric disorder is related to service.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Entitlement to service connection requires evidence sufficient to establish (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 505 (1995).

Certain chronic diseases, such as psychoses including schizophrenia, may be presumed to have been incurred during service if manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309, 3.384. Moreover, if a disease listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is shown to be chronic in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).  For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. Id. 

However, if evidence of a chronic condition is noted during service or during the presumptive period, but the chronic condition is not "shown to be chronic, or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned," i.e., "when the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported," then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required to support a claim for disability compensation for the chronic disease. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b)). A claimant "can benefit from continuity of symptomatology to establish service connection in the ultimate sense, but only if [the] chronic disease is one listed in § 3.309(a)." Id. at 1337.

A September 2020 rating decision denied service connection for schizophrenia, claimed as an acquired psychiatric disorder to include schizophrenia.  The AOJ favorably found that the Veteran was presently diagnosed with schizophrenia and had psychiatric symptoms during service, but stated that "[t]here is no evidence a psychosis condition such as schizophrenia began in service." The RO also stated that, under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 and 3.309, the Veteran's currently diagnosed schizophrenia "is not one of the chronic diseases that VA presumes is related to your military service."

?

Among the chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) are "psychoses." For purposes of 38 C.F.R. Part 3, the term "psychosis" means brief psychotic disorder, delusional disorder, psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. 38 C.F.R. § 3.384.

Psychoses, including schizophrenia, are thus chronic disorders which may be presumed to have been incurred during service if manifest to a compensable degree within one year after discharge from active service even if there is no record of such a disorder while in service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.309(a), 3.384.  

The Veteran is currently diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1996. See September 2020 VA Examination; June 1999 VA Discharge Summary.  The first element of service connection is met.

Service records show that at enlistment to service, the Veteran reported no nervous trouble of any sort. At separation in December 1976, a physician indicated a psychiatric evaluation was normal and that the Veteran had not yet gone to sick call.  However, the Veteran reported nervous trouble, anxiety, excessive worry, frequent trouble sleeping, and memory loss. He also described nervousness which caused him to worry so much that he could not sleep.  See December 1976 Report of Medical History, Report of Medical Examination. The second element of service connection is met.

A September 2020 VA examiner diagnosed schizophrenia with symptoms including anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and mild memory loss.  Additional symptoms included visual hallucinations and paranoia.  The examiner noted the Veteran's report that "[h]allucinations and paranoia were active while in the service. He did not know what this was, and he did not go to medical."  The examiner noted that while the Veteran reported he got along "ok" with others during service, he reported he was discharged because he was "getting sick."  At that time, the Veteran reported he had a hard time functioning after service, and that it worsened after he married. He described his anxiety, which the examiner measured as severe, as feelings of being on edge, irritable, and causing worry which kept him awake at night.

With regard to presumptive service connection based on manifestations of psychosis within one year following separation from service, there is a record of psychiatric symptoms having manifested during service. See December 1976 Report of Medical History; September 2020 VA Examination.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was not diagnosed with schizophrenia within one year of separation from service.  Instead, the record shows that the Veteran was first diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1996, many years after his separation from service.  

The disorder need not be diagnosed within the presumptive period. Instead, it must be shown by acceptable lay or medical evidence that there were characteristic manifestations of the disorder, and moreover, "[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when... lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional." See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

Here, the September 2020 VA examiner clearly explained how symptoms reported by the Veteran at separation from service relate to the current symptoms of his present schizophrenia-they are the same.  An examination report is adequate if it is based upon consideration of pertinent medical history, addresses lay "reports of symptoms and medical history," and includes detail sufficient to inform the Board of a medical expert's judgment on a medical question and essential rationale Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007); Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 254 (2020).  

Based on this medical evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's current schizophrenia manifested within one year of his separation from active service. The only evidence tending to weigh against such a finding is that the Veteran was not diagnosed with schizophrenia until 1996. While the date of diagnosis is probative, it must be considered and weighed with the other competent evidence of record, including the Veteran's reports at separation from active service and at the time of VA examination in September 2020, which supported that examiner's diagnosis of schizophrenia.  ?

Here, the lay and medical evidence establishes that symptoms of the Veteran's presently diagnosed schizophrenia manifested in service, continued within one year of his separation from active service, and remained chronic since that time. The claim for entitlement to service connection for schizophrenia is granted.
