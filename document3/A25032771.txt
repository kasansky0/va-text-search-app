REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability evaluation based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) from May 2014 is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force from January 1974 to August 1977, December 1990 to 1991 and September 2003 to March 2004. See Forms DD 214 dated August 1988, March 1992 and February 2005.  He also had extensive service of an unverified nature and duration in the West Virginia Air National Guard.

 On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (to be codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). This law creates a new framework for appellants dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review.  

An AMA appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in one of three ways: (1) an appeal of a Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) rating decision; (2) an appeal of a rating decision with a notification letter dated on or after February 19, 2019; or (3) an opt-in to the AMA system from a statement of the case or supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) issued on or after February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400; 19.2(d). 

The matter currently at issue comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from May 2021 Supplemental Statement of the Case by a Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) of the Veteran Benefits Administration (VBA), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).   

In the timely June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran chose the Evidence Submission docket. By law, for claims appealed in this docket, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2020 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, then, by law, the Board was not permitted to consider that evidence in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.   

Procedural History and Factual Background

In September 2015, the Veteran underwent a VA examination related to his right knee, and a diagnosis of right knee chondromalacia was rendered. The Veteran reported that this disability resulted in knee pain on weight-bearing and walking downstairs and flare-ups with prolonged standing, walking and climbing stairs.  

In May 2017, the Veteran underwent another VA examination related to his right knee. His diagnosis was "arthritis, right knee with limitation of motion, flexion; degeneration, medial meniscus, right knee" and right knee meniscal tear. The Veteran reported that he hurt his knee while running in 2002. He reported that the disability had progressed, with increased pain and decreased range of motion. He reported functional impairment in going down steps, inability to run, ride a bicycle or walk at a normal speed. He used a right knee brace for support.

In July 2018, the Veteran underwent another VA examination related to his right knee. He reported increased pain with walking long distances, decreased range of motion, and that he could only walk 30 to 40 yards without needing rest. He reported functional impairment, including the inability to stand from a sitting position without the use of his hands. 

In December 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. He asserted that his service- connected disabilities (including posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD)) prevented him from securing and following any substantially gainful employment. The Veteran stated that he last worked full-time in May 2014, when he became too disabled to work. He worked for Bayer for 27 years as a chemical operator before his retirement. He described his employment schedule as "working 48 hours one week, and 36 hours the next." The Veteran also noted that he had an Associate's Degree in Business Management.

Additionally, in December 2020, the Veteran submitted a private vocational assessment report. The certified rehabilitation consultant opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran has been unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment since May 2014. The consultant found that the Veteran was precluded from gainful employment (including sedentary work) due to his service-connected right knee disability, considered alone and in concert with his other service-connected disabilities, which included PTSD and actinic keratosis. The consultant found that the Veteran's symptoms and limitations from his service-connected disabilities included chronic pain, difficulty with sitting, standing and walking, chronic fatigue, distracting skin irritation, difficulty with social interactions and severe limitations with maintaining concentration, focus and pace.  

In January 2021, the Board remanded the issue of entitlement to a TDIU for further development, finding that the issues of an increased rating for actinic keratosis and service connection for oral cancer were inextricably intertwined. The Board found that these issues impacted the decision on TDIU and must be decided first.  

In March 2021, the Veteran underwent a VA examination related to his service-connected skin disability. The examiner noted a history of actinic keratosis of the scalp and bilateral ears. The examiner found that the Veteran's skin disability impacted his ability to work. The examiner noted that the Veteran was a retired loader of cargo planes. The examiner stated that the Veteran's skin disability impacted his ability to work in direct sunlight, including working in construction.   

In a May 2021 Supplemental Statement of the Case, the Board again denied entitlement to TDIU, finding no evidence in treatment records that the current service-connected conditions would prevent the Veteran from obtaining and maintaining gainful employment. The appeal was not submitted for extra-schedular consideration because "the evidence fails to show you are unemployable due to service-connected disabilities." 

In June 2021, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement appealing the May 2021 Supplemental Statement of the Case. 

Legal Criteria

Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. §3.340. Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, the disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more. If there are two or more such disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. §4.16(a).

In evaluating a veteran's employability, consideration may be given to his or her level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not his age or impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. 3.341, 4.16, 4.19. In Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993), the Court held that the central inquiry in determining whether a veteran is entitled to a TDIU is whether a veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. The determination as to whether a total disability is appropriate should not be based solely on demonstrated difficulty in obtaining employment in one particular field, which could also potentially be due to external bases such as economic factors, but rather to all reasonably available sources of employment under the circumstances. Ferraro v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 326, 331-332 (1991).

The ultimate issue of whether a TDIU should be awarded is not a medical issue, but rather a determination for the adjudicator. Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 218. (2007)

Where the percentage requirements under 38 C.F.R. 4.16(a) are not met, entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis may be considered when the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §4.16(b). However, the Board cannot not consider entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis in the first instance. Instead, the Board is required to refer all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in 38 C.F.R. §4.16(a), to the Director for extraschedular consideration. 38 C.F.R. §4.16(b); Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1 (2001). 

Rather, the Board's sole inquiry is whether a referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted in light of the evidence. If the Board finds "sufficient evidence" to substantiate a "reasonable possibility" that a veteran may be unemployable because of service-connected disabilities, then the proper course of action is to remand the claim for referral to the Undersecretary for Benefits or the AOJ's Director of Compensation Service for an advisory opinion for extraschedular consideration. 38 C.F.R.4.16(b). 

If the Board determines that a referral is not appropriate, the Court has held than a different analysis must be undertaken. To this point, the Court held in Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. (2021) that if the Board denies a referral, it must make two determinations: (1) that a referral for extraschedular TDIU consideration is not warranted because there is insufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran is unemployable because of service-connected disabilities; and (2) that TDIU benefits are not warranted because service-connected disabilities did not render the veteran unemployable. 

Discussion

As stated above, the record indicates that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have precluded him from securing and maintaining substantially gainful employment since May 2014. 

The Veteran has the following disabilities that are service connected: arthritis with limitation of extension (previously rated as arthritis, right knee with limitation of motion, flexion) rated 40 percent from June 25, 2008 to present; PTSD, rated 10 percent from October 30, 2006 to January 14, 2008, and rated 30 percent from January 15, 2008 to present; right knee degeneration (medial meniscus) rated 10 percent from March 8, 2004 to present; and actinic keratosis, rated noncompensable from February 14, 2005.

Based on the foregoing, from May 2014, the Veteran's combined evaluation does not meet the percentage standards set forth in 4.16(a) for a schedular TDIU. Therefore, the Board may not consider the Veteran's claim for a TDIU in the first instance. 

However, the evidence of record reflects that the Veteran retired from his most recent employment as a chemical operator in May 2014 and reports of VA knee examinations completed in September 2015, May 2017 and July 2018, the report of a VA skin examination completed in March 2021, and a December 2020 vocational assessment report reflect that the Veteran's service-connected right knee disability as well as his other service-connected disabilities negatively impacted his ability to secure and maintain a substantially gainful occupation. Here, the Board finds sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran may be unemployable because of service-connected disabilities.

With the above in mind, neither prong under Snider is sufficed. As such, the appeal must be considered on an extraschedular basis under 38 C.F.R. §4.16(b) and a referral seeking a TDIU from May 2014 to the Undersecretary of Benefits or the AOJ's Director of Compensation Service for actions under 4.16(b) is appropriate.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Refer the Veteran's claim for entitlement to TDIU, to include on an extraschedular basis, from May 2014 to the present, to the Undersecretary for Benefits of the Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration and an advisory opinion under 38 C.F.R. §4.16(b). A copy of the Director's decision must be associated with the claims file.  

2. Thereafter, the AOJ must readjudicate the Veteran's appeal seeking a TDIU based on a totality of the evidence for review.  If the benefit sought is not granted to the fullest extent, the AOJ must provide a copy of the readjudication to the Veteran and his private attorney and afford them an appropriate opportunity to respond.
