REMANDED

Entitlement to beneficiary travel expenses incurred on November 19, 2019, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1974 to November 1978.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a purported September 2020 determination issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Financial Services Center.

In his November 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding this claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in its adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to beneficiary travel expenses incurred on November 19, 2019

The Board finds that the AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error by failing to associate the Veteran's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) claim file pertaining to his claim for payment or reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses incurred on November 19, 2019, with the electronic record.

Significantly, review of the available record reveals the Veteran's November 2020 VA Form 10182 as well as the September 2020 AOJ decision (included only because the Veteran submitted it); however, all other relevant evidence, including VA treatment records, relevant private treatment and medical bills, AOJ decision(s), claim(s) for reimbursement, and any statement(s) from the Veteran related to incurred travel expenses, has not been associated with the record. 

The Board finds that a remand is necessary to obtain and associate with the electronic record, the Veteran's complete VHA claim file to determine whether entitlement to payment or reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses incurred on November 19, 2019, is warranted.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Associate the Veteran's VHA claim file with the electronic record, to include obtaining any VA treatment records, relevant private treatment records and medical bills, AOJ decision(s), claim(s) for reimbursement, and any statement(s) from the Veteran. In particular, the November 2019 AOJ decision cited in the Veteran's November 2020 notice of disagreement should be associated with the claim file.

Make a formal finding of unavailability if the records are unable to be obtained.
