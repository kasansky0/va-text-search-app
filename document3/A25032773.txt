ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to November 12, 2019, for service connection for GERD is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's GERD did not more nearly approximate symptoms that were productive of serious impairment of health and does not have a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following: dilatation 3 or more times per year, dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or esophageal stent placement.

2. Entitlement to service connection for GERD arose as secondary to the service-connected lumbar spine disability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for service-connected GERD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7206 and 7346.

2. The criteria for assignment of an effective date earlier than November 12, 2019, for the grant of service connection for GERD are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110, 5111; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army from May 1954 to May 1956.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a veteran's present symptomatology with criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on average impairment in earning capacity. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. Id. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability ratings. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Id.

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of their symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).

Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board notes that it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review. This includes, but is not limited to, VA treatment records for the period on appeal, the September 2023 VA examination, and a private medical opinion. Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record.  Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims.  See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for GERD.

The Veteran is seeking a higher disability rating because he contends that his symptoms are more severe than currently rated.

The Veteran's GERD is rated by analogy to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346, for hiatal hernia. 

The Board notes that during the pendency of the appeal, VA amended the criteria for rating disabilities of the digestive system under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 effective May 19, 2024. These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after May 19, 2024.

Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied. The Board cannot apply a current regulation prior to its effective date unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. See Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; Kuzma, 341 F. 3d 1327. 

In accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 under the pre-amendment criteria, ratings under DCs 7301 to 7329 inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348 inclusive will not be combined with each other.  A single evaluation will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.

Pursuant to the pre-amendment DC 7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. A maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 

The words "considerable," and "severe" as used in the various diagnostic codes are not defined in the VA Rating Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence, to the end that its decisions are equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. In the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning. See Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015) (citations omitted). "Considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267 (11th ed. 2012). "Severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." Id. at 1140. 

In assigning a rating under DC 7346, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). 

The rating criteria are not successive or cumulative with that of the lower rating. See Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152, 155 (2009); see also Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470, 472 (2006) (stating that disabilities rated by analogy will not show all objective criteria of the analogous rating).

Under the pre-amendment criteria, a higher 60 percent rating under DC 7346 is not warranted unless there are symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

Effective May 19, 2024, VA amended the schedule for rating disabilities of the digestive system. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: The Digestive System, 89 Fed. Reg. 19, 735 (Mar. 20, 2024). Pursuant to this amendment, VA created DC 7206 for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and revised DC 7346 for hiatal hernia to direct VA adjudicators to rate this disability pursuant to stricture of the esophagus under DC 7203. 

In accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, ratings under DCs 7301 through 7329 inclusive, 7331, 7342, 7345 through 7350 inclusive, 7352, and 7355 through 7357 inclusive will not be combined with each other. Instead, when more than one rating is warranted under those DCs, assign a single evaluation under the DC that reflects the predominant disability picture, and elevate it to the next higher evaluation if warranted by the severity of the overall disability.

Pursuant to the post-amendment DC 7206 criteria, a noncompensable rating is warranted for a documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications. A 10 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic. A 30 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year. A 50 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement. A maximum 80 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of these symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 4.112(a), and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture(s) or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube). 38 C.F.R. § 4.112(a) defines substantial weight loss as "involuntary loss greater than 20% of an individual's baseline weight sustained for three months with diminished quality of self-care or work tasks."

DC 7206 contains several notes to assist in its application. Note (1) provides that findings associated with the disability in question must be documented by barium swallow, computerized tomography, or esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Note (2), directs VA to evaluate non-gastrointestinal complications of procedures of the disability at issue under the appropriate system at issue.

Notes (4) and (5) define recurrent and refractory esophageal strictures as contemplated by DC 7206. Specifically, Note (4) defines recurrent esophageal stricture as "the inability to maintain target esophageal diameter beyond 4 weeks after the target diameter has been achieved." Comparatively, Note (5) defines refractory esophageal stricture as "the inability to achieve target esophageal diameter despite receiving no fewer than 5 dilatation sessions performed at 2-week intervals."

Turning to the medical evidence of record, treatment records indicate the Veteran's GERD was mild and that he denied weight change, poor appetite, heartburn, nausea or vomiting.  See January 2020 VA treatment records.  The Veteran's GERD is generally well controlled on Omeprazole, and he denies dysphagia, odynophagia, and dark stools. See April 2022, October 2022, November 2022 VA treatment records. It was noted the Veteran was not interested in stopping medication treatment due to good control of his GERD. See March 2023 and September 2023 VA treatment records.

The Veteran was afforded a September 2023 VA examination. He reported that he believes his GERD caused or worsened his hemorrhoid condition making it difficult for him to work. He stated it is also difficult for him to enjoy activities with family and friends because there is so little he can eat. Upon examination, it was noted that the Veteran's symptoms were productive of considerable impairment of health and included persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, sleep disturbance 4 or more times per year, and material weight loss. No esophageal stricture, spasm or diverticula, neoplasms or metastases were noted. 

No esophageal varices have been documented.  See September 2023 and December 2023 VA treatment records.

The Veteran reported that his GERD affects his ability to do household chores due to pain that he described as "like a heartache that paralyzes me once a month and prevents me from doing anything." He reported difficulty chewing and that he had to cut his food into smaller pieces to be able to swallow it. See January 2025 Affidavit.

Accordingly, based upon the evidence of record for the period on appeal, the Veteran's GERD did not more nearly approximate symptoms of pain, vomiting, hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. A higher 60 percent rating under the pre-amendment DC 7346 is, therefore, not warranted.

Additionally, the Veteran did not report, and the VA examination did not find any esophageal strictures which required either dilatation 3 or more times per year, dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or esophageal stent placement. Thus, a higher 50 percent rating under the post-amendment DC 7206 is not warranted.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 30 percent for GERD.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 30 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to November 12, 2019, for service connection for GERD.

The Veteran contends the proper effective date for service connection for GERD is November 6, 2018, the date of the initial, continuously pursued claim. See January 2025 third party correspondence.

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Otherwise, for an award based on an original claim, claim reopened after a final disallowance, or claim for an increased rating, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Id. 

In this case, the Veteran submitted a claim, in relevant part, for GERD on November 6, 2018. 

In regard to the date entitlement arose, the Veteran's claim for GERD that was denied by the AOJ in March 2019.  He submitted a supplemental claim for GERD in March 2020 that was denied by the AOJ in April 2022. The Veteran appealed the decision in April 2022 and was granted service connection as secondary to his service-connected lumbar spine and the medications used to treat those conditions by the Board in August 2023.  The AOJ granted a non-compensable rating effective November 12, 2019, the date the primary disability, intervertebral disc disorder lumbar region, was granted service connection.  

Of note, the AOJ granted service connection for intervertebral disc disorder lumbar region in an April 2023 rating decision. The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement with the effective date of service connection for intervertebral disc disorder within one year of the notification.  Therefore, the April 2023 rating decision assigning the effective date of service connection for the primary disability, intervertebral disc disorder, became final. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (d). As such, the date of entitlement arose was November 12, 2019. 

(Continued on the next page)

?

As the date entitlement arose is after the date of claim, the Board finds that the AOJ assigned the appropriate effective date of November 12, 2019. As such, an effective date prior to November 12, 2019, is denied.
