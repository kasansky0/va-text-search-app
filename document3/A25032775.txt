ORDER

The appeal seeking entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 1, 2016 for the award of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on loss of use of the right ankle and foot is dismissed.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 20, 2016 for the award of SMC based on the need of the regular aid and attendance of another person is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a February 3, 2022 decision, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) awarded entitlement to a 40 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected right ankle disability and awarded SMC based on loss of use of his right foot and ankle, both effective September 1, 2016. 

2. In rating decisions issued in February and May 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) implemented the Board's decision, in relevant part, awarding the 40 percent disability rating and SMC based on the loss of use of the Veteran's right foot and ankle, both effective September 1, 2016.

3. In May 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim, in pertinent part, requesting review of the May 2022 AOJ rating decision concerning the effective date of SMC based on loss of use of the Veteran's right foot and ankle; acceptance of this specific issue in the form of a supplemental claim was in error.

4. The evidence persuasively demonstrates that the Veteran has required the regular aid and attendance of another person due to his service-connected disabilities since May 20, 2016.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for the dismissal of the claim for entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 1, 2016 for the award of SMC based on loss of use of the right ankle and foot have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 20, 2016 for the award of SMC based on the need of regular aid and attendance of another person have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(l), 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350(b)(4), 3.352(a), 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1991 to January 1994, with additional periods of service in the Army National Guard of Oklahoma.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) which denied earlier effective dates for the awards of entitlement to SMC based on the need of the regular aid and attendance of another person and entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of his right foot. The Veteran timely filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and selected the Direct Review docket.

As the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Dismissals

The Board is charged with making final decisions on all questions in a matter which, under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a), is subject to decision by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 7104. One of the principal functions of the Board is to make determinations of appellate jurisdiction. 38 C.F.R. § 20.103. If the Board determines that it does not have jurisdiction over a case, the case may be dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

1. The appeal seeking entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 1, 2016 for the award of SMC based on loss of use of the right ankle and foot is dismissed.

The Veteran maintains entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 1, 2016 for the award of SMC based on loss of use of the right ankle and foot. 

In a February 2022 decision, the Board, in relevant part, adjudicated a claim of entitlement to an increased disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected right ankle disability. The Board awarded a 40 percent disability rating and SMC based on loss of use of the right ankle and foot, both effective September 1, 2016. The AOJ then issued rating decisions in February and May 2022 which, in pertinent part, implemented the Board's decision. In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim requesting review of the May 2022 rating decision pertaining to the effective date of SMC based on loss of use. The supplemental claim was accepted by the AOJ, which issued a rating decision in May 2023 denying the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of SMC based on loss of use of the right ankle and foot. The Veteran appealed this decision, eventually filing his April 2024 VA Form 10182, which generated the instant appeal.

The Board finds that the May 2023 supplemental claim was accepted in error. Under the Legacy appeal system, all Board decisions are final on the date stamped on the face of the decision. See 38 C.F.R. 20.1100. There are three exceptions to this finality: (1) a claimant may file a Notice of Appeal within 120 days of the Board's Decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC), (2) a claimant may request the Board reconsider its decision, and (3) a claimant may file a motion with the Board to revise its decision because it was the product of clear and unmistakable error. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7103, 7111, 7252(a), 7266; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1400, 20.1404, 20.1410.  

The Board finds that the Veteran did not proceed under one of the three exceptions within the applicable time frame following the February 2022 Board decision; therefore, it became final.

"[A]n action that does nothing more than implement a grant of benefits already determined by another agency department falls outside the definition of "decision" because it lacks the requisite assessment of legal or factual issues. Such action is ministerial rather than adjudicative in nature; it merely effectuates an earlier judgment and leaves no room during implementation for choice or discretion." Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194, 200 (2023) (citing Griffin v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 288 F.3d 1309, 1323-24 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).

As the May 2022 rating decision did not "make a determination after consideration of the facts and the law", it is not considered a decision which establishes jurisdiction. See Encarnacion, 288 F.3d at 200. Thus, the May 2023 supplemental claim was accepted in error and the appeal must be dismissed.

Earlier Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, the Court in Bradley v. Peake, held that SMC benefits are to be accorded when a veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim. 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008) (citing Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991) (noting VA's policy to consider SMC where applicable)); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993) (claimant is presumed to be seeking the maximum benefit allowed by law and regulation); 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(a) ("it is the obligation of VA to assist a claimant in developing the facts pertinent to the claim and to render a decision which grants every benefit that can be supported in law"). Thus, any effective date must be based on the point in time when the evidence first supports an award of SMC, which may be well before a Veteran raised the issue of his entitlement to SMC. Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 294 (citing 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110(a), 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)).

SMC by reason of the need for regular aid and attendance of another person is payable if a Veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, either: (1) has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, (2) has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of one hand and one foot, (3) is blind in both eyes with 5/200 visual acuity or less, (4) is permanently bedridden, or (5) is with such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. 38 U.S.C.§ 1114 (l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b). Where the Veteran is bedridden, SMC(l) is awarded specifically on the basis of the Veteran's bedridden status, as opposed to on the basis of factual need for aid attendance, described below. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b)(4).

The criteria to be considered in establishing a factual need for aid and attendance include: the inability of a claimant to dress or undress himself, or to keep himself ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid (this will not include the adjustment of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); inability of claimant to feed himself through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or, incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to his daily environment. See 38 C.F.R. §3.352(a). It is not required that all of the disabling conditions noted above be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. Id.; see Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222, 224 (1996) (holding that at least one factor listed in § 3.352(a) must be present to grant SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance of another person). 

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 20, 2016 for SMC based on the need of the regular aid and attendance of another person is granted.

The Veteran maintains entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 23, 2018 for the award of SMC based on the need of the regular aid and attendance of another person. He asserts that the issue was part and parcel of his November  2015 increased rating claim for his service-connected right ankle disability, and was continuously pursued therefrom. The Board agrees. 

As an initial matter, the evidence does not indicate, and the Veteran does not assert, that he had anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet or one hand and one foot; was blind or so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity of 5/200 or less in both eyes or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less; was a patient in a nursing home because of mental or physical incapacity; or was permanently bedridden. Thus, the question for the Board is when the evidence demonstrates a factual need for aid and attendance under 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a). 

At the Veteran's February 2018 Board hearing regarding the aforementioned increased rating claims, he testified that he needed his wife's assistance with walking, putting on socks, shoes, and pants, standing from a seated position, and getting in and out of bed. He also described the ever present risk of falls. Importantly, the Veteran identified these needs retrospectively; indicated that they were necessary since undergoing right ankle tibiotarsal fusion and removal of hardware on May 20, 2016. 

Additionally, in May 2023 the Veteran's wife submitted a sworn statement indicating that the Veteran has experienced difficulties with his service-connected disabilities, including his right ankle, since at least 2016, which required her to assist him with various tasks. These tasks included getting in and out of bed, assistance with getting in and out of the shower, assistance with dressing, cooking meals, and traveling to medical appointments. She further indicated that she was unable to hold a job consistently because the Veteran required full-time aid. 

The Board finds that the Veteran and his wife are competent to provide lay testimony regarding the effects of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities and his actual need for assistance with the activities of daily life. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307-08 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70. 

When viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds that entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 20, 2016 for the award of SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance of another person is warranted. The claim is granted.
