DOCKET NO. 240422-433778
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the reduction in rating for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, as adjudicated in the April 2023 rating decision, is dismissed.

The appeal seeking restoration of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Benefits (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, as adjudicated in the April 2023 rating decision, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On January 27, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant that a complete withdrawal of all appeals was requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1988 to September 1990.

An April 2023 rating decision, with notification letter dated April 24, 2023, reduced the rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder from a 100 percent rating to a 70 percent rating. At the same time, this rating decision terminated the ancillary benefit of entitlement to Chapter 35 DEA, because the rating reduction resulted in the Veteran no longer meeting the criteria for a permanent and total disability rating, which is required for DEA eligibility. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Board notes that in the April 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran listed only the issue of eligibility for DEA as the issue on appeal-he did not specifically appeal the rating reduction for his psychiatric disorder. However, he included argument suggesting that VA's "evaluation" of his psychiatric disorder was incorrect. Given that the Board must liberally construe appellants' pleadings, and considering that DEA eligibility was only terminated because the psychiatric rating was reduced, and any eligibility for DEA is thus dependent upon its restoration, the Board construes the April 2024 appeal to have implicitly included the propriety of the reduction of the psychiatric rating and a concomitant request for restoration of the prior 100 percent rating. As such, there are two issues on appeal before the Board.

As the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

Here, the Veteran has validly withdrawn his appeal. The withdrawal of the appeal was completed by written and signed correspondence from the Veteran-Appellant, dated in January 2025, which included the Veteran's name and his VA claim number. The Appellant also stated he wished to withdraw "all current appeals" and no longer wished to pursue the issues on appeal. See January 2025 VA Form 21-4138. The Board therefore finds that the regulatory criteria for withdrawal of an appeal have been met. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In the present case, the Appellant has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
