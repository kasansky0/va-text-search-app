FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has continuously pursued a claim for separate or higher ratings for his respiratory disabilities since his September 3, 2020, claim.

2. The evidence of record is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran has had sleep apnea since filing his September 3, 2020, claim, and that such required use of a breathing assistance device such as a continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine.

3. The evidence favors a finding that the Veteran has been unable to secure or follow gainful employment due to the disabling effects of his service-connected disabilities, effective September 3, 2020.

4. Based on the award of TDIU from September 3, 2020, the Veteran also met the basic eligibility requirements for DEA benefits as of that date.

5. As of August 10, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected disability ratings warranted entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate.

6. In a June 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claims for entitlement to compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for loss of mobility, vertigo and fatigue.

7. In July 2023, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim requesting readjudication of entitlement to compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for loss of mobility, vertigo and fatigue.

8. Evidence received since the June 2022 rating decision does not tend to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the Veteran's claim for compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for loss of mobility, vertigo and fatigue.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from February 1970 to September 1991.  

This appeal stems from several rating decisions issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within the year prior to the Veteran's filing of a July 2024 VA Form 10182.  

In an October 2, 2023, rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, proposed to reduce the 10 percent ratings in effect for the Veteran's service-connected right- and left-hand tremors, and right and left foot unsteadiness.  The AOJ ultimately issued a March 21, 2024, decision confirming and continuing the respective 10 percent ratings, without implementing any reduction.

In an October 19, 2023, rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to a TDIU.  

In a March 8, 2024, rating decision, the AOJ recognized pulmonary fibrosis as a service-connected disability and continued the 50 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected respiratory conditions, which were characterized at the time as obstructive sleep apnea with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  

In a May 9, 2024, rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, denied the Veteran's claims for compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for fatigue, loss of mobility and vertigo.

In a June 18, 2024, Higher Level Review rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, granted entitlement to a TDIU, SMC at the housebound rate and DEA eligibility, all effective September 28, 2022.  The AOJ also denied the Veteran's request for a separate or higher rating for his service-connected respiratory disability, characterized as obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis.  This rating decision was issued in response to a March 4, 2024, Higher Level Review request of a May 2023 rating decision (which denied the respiratory disability claim), and the above-referenced October 19, 2023, rating decision (which denied entitlement to a TDIU). 

The Veteran and his attorney filed a July 2024 VA Form 10182, disagreeing with several aspects of each of these rating decisions.  The Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on November 13, 2024.

For all issues stemming from rating decisions other than the June 18, 2024, Higher Level Review rating decision, the Board may consider all evidence of record at the time of the respective rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  For the issues decided in the June 18, 2024, Higher Level Review rating decision, the Board may only consider evidence at the time of the May 2023 rating decision for the respiratory disability claim, and the October 19, 2023, rating decision for the TDIU/DEA/SMC claims, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, for the issues the Board is remanding below, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

For clarity, the Board will briefly discuss each of the contentions/issues of disagreement raised by the Veteran's attorney on the July 2024 VA Form 10182.  

1. Failure to address a request for higher ratings outlined in a June 2022 Supplemental Claim for decision date October 2, 2023.  

As noted above, the October 2, 2023, rating decision proposed to reduce 10 percent ratings in effect for the Veteran's service-connected right- and left-hand tremors, and right and left foot unsteadiness.  The Veteran's attorney is correct, that any request for higher ratings was not addressed.  In fact, no decision one way or another was made about the Veteran's ratings, as the decision was merely a notice of proposed action not yet taken.  See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011).  Nevertheless, in a subsequent March 21, 2024, decision, the AOJ confirmed and continuing the respective 10 percent ratings, without implementing any reduction.  The Board has accepted at issue the question of whether ratings higher the currently-assigned 10 percent for each extremity are warranted, as the ratings themselves were specifically discussed in the March 21, 2024, rating decision.  Thus, the Veteran was afforded an initial review of the ratings question by the AOJ, and it is now subject to appeal before the Board.

2. Defective notice as to the date [of] claim that was filed, and failure to recognize the TDIU request as an ancillary benefit to the claim filed in September 2020 for decision dated October 19, 2023.  

As noted above, the AOJ denied the Veteran's TDIU claim in an October 19, 2023, decision.  With the rating decision, the AOJ informed that the Veteran filed a new claim for benefits received on July 18, 2022.  Ultimately, the AOJ granted entitlement to a TDIU in the June 18, 2024, rating decision, but only made the award effective September 28, 2022.  Given the contentions raised in the July 2024 VA Form 10182 and at the November 2024 Board hearing, it is clear the Veteran and his attorney believe the claim should be considered part and parcel to other issues that remained pending an on appeal since the Veteran filed a claim for benefits on September 3, 2020.  For the reasons discussed below, the Board will be granting entitlement to a TDIU as of September 3, 2020.  Therefore, any failure to notify the Veteran of a specific date of claim was not prejudicial in this regard.

3. Failure to provide favorable findings on the notice dated October 19, 2023.

Initially, the Board notes that within the actual October 19, 2023, rating decision, the AOJ did list favorable findings-namely, that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities met the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU award, and that the Veteran was not employed.  While the October 24, 2023, notice letter informing the Veteran of this decision did not list these favorable findings, the actual rating decision was attached to the notice letter.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(f) requires that the claimant and his representative be notified in writing of decisions affecting the payment of benefits or granting of relief.  Written notification must include in the notice letter or enclosures or a combination thereof, several elements including a listing of any findings made by the adjudicator that are favorable to the claimant.  Here, the AOJ satisfied its notice obligation by attaching the October 19, 2023, rating decision as an enclosure with the October 24, 2023, notice letter.  In any event, even if there was a notice deficiency, the Board is granting the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for the TDIU award to the date specifically requested by the Veteran's attorney.  Thus, there is no harm or prejudice in any failure on the part of the AOJ in providing notice of favorable findings regarding the TDIU claim.

4.  Failure to recognize the date of claim as September 2020 for decision dated March 8, 2024.  

5.  Failure to maximize benefits and award highest rating from September 2020 claim for all disability resulting from all lung disease for decision dated March 8, 2024.   

In the March 8, 2024, decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for pulmonary fibrosis and added the disability to the Veteran's list of service-connected respiratory disabilities with a singular 50 percent rating.  Insofar as these contentions are part of a broader contention that the Veteran's respiratory conditions have been improperly characterized and rated since the original award of service connection for breathing problems, effective September 3, 2020, the issue will be discussed in more detail below.  The Board agrees that the Veteran's claim for separate or higher ratings for his respiratory disabilities has been continuously pursued since his September 3, 2020, claim.  

6. Failure to follow 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(2) for decision dated March 21, 2024.

In the March 21, 2024, rating decision, the AOJ continued the Veteran's 10 percent disability ratings for each extremity (tremors of the right and left hands and unsteadiness of the right and left feet), and determined higher ratings were not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(2) pertains to AOJ consideration of new and relevant evidence received prior to the time it issues its decision on a supplemental claim.  The Veteran's attorney did not specify what evidence the AOJ may have overlooked.  In any event, insofar as the Veteran's attorney is stipulating that the AOJ did not consider all the evidence before it at the time of the March 21, 2024, decision, the Board will be reviewing and considering all evidence received prior to March 21, 2024 decision below.  

7.  Failure to list all ancillary benefits associated with the Veteran's September 2020 claim for decision dated March 21, 2024.

8. Failure to adjudicate entitlement to aid and attendance and other SMC ratings that was raised at the February 2024 hearing for decision dated March 21, 2024.

9. Implicit denial (under 3.155(d)(2)) of aid and attendance rating as an ancillary benefit for decision dated March 21, 2024.

10. Entitlement to aid and attendance as a result of essential tremors as an ancillary benefit for decision dated March 21, 2024.

11. General notice errors to be developed in later argument at the Board hearing for decision dated March 21, 2024.

12. Failure to maximize benefits and award highest rating from September 2020 claim for all disability resulting from service in the Gulf for decision dated March 21, 2024.  

It is clear from these contentions, and from argument made at the November 2024 Board hearing, that the Veteran is seeking maximum disability benefits, including entitlement to the highest levels of SMC, as of the date of his September 2020 claim.  As will be discussed below, the Veteran did raise the question of whether he was in need of the aid and attendance of another (see an August 2023 central nervous system examination (noting the Veteran's wife was required to assist with meals, bathing and dressing); see also a February 2024 AOJ hearing transcript, at 7), but such was not addressed by the AOJ in any rating decision on appeal.  In light of the awards granted in this decision, the Board will be remanding the Veteran's reasonably raised question of entitlement to higher levels of SMC to the AOJ as intertwined with the effectuation of the awards.  

Insofar as the Veteran's attorney's is requesting additional compensation for disability related to Gulf War service, he does not specify on his VA Form 10182 what conditions the Veteran believes are related to such service.  Insofar as the Veteran's attorney is referring to loss of mobility, fatigue and vertigo, such will be discussed in more detail immediately below.  

13.  Loss of mobility, fatigue, and vertigo, all resulting from essential tremors; and failure to follow 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(2) for decision dated May 9, 2024.  

The Veteran's loss of mobility, fatigue and vertigo claims were all raised within the context of a claim for compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151.  See the Veteran's July 2023 Supplemental Claim.  The AOJ denied these claims in the above-referenced May 9, 2024, decision, finding that new and relevant evidence had not been received warranting readjudication of the § 1151 claims.  The Board will discuss this matter in its analysis on new and relevant evidence below. 

The Veteran's attorney has also asked the Board to consider whether compensation for loss of mobility, fatigue and vertigo may be granted not only under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151, but also under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 and § 3.310 governing direct and secondary service connection.  At the November 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran's attorney stated, "[w]ith respect to 1151 claim, these were all disabilities that resulted from his undiagnosed illness which the VA has already recognized was incurred during his service."  See the November 2024 Board hearing transcript, at 13.  In a prior statement received on August 4, 2023, the Veteran also attributed vertigo to COPD, and fatigue and loss of mobility to pulmonary fibrosis.  

Claims for service connection are separate and distinct from claims for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151.  Anderson v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 371 (2004).  The Board therefore cannot address entitlement to direct or secondary service connection in the first instance, when the claim was raised and initially adjudicated as one for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151.  The Board observes that the Veteran previously claimed entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome, manifesting specifically in fatigue, dizziness and limited mobility, as due to Gulf War illness, and such was denied by the AOJ in an unappealed February 2023 rating decision.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim if he wishes VA to readjudicate that determination.

Insofar as the Veteran or the Veteran's attorney has suggested the Veteran's service-connected respiratory disabilities, or hand tremors and unsteadiness of the right and left feet have impacted daily life, to include negatively impacting his strength and ability to ambulate, the Board will consider these statements in discussing the issues of whether higher or separate ratings are warranted for these service-connected conditions, which are on appeal before the Board from the March 8, 2024, March 21, 2024, and June 18, 2024 rating decisions. 

Finally, the Board observes that entitlement to compensation for anxiety under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 was referenced at the Board hearing as another issue on appeal from the May 9, 2024, rating decision; however, a close review of the Veteran's VA Form 10182 shows that the Veteran did not disagree with the AOJ's denial of that claim.  Accordingly, the matter is not for appellate review at this time.  The Board adds that neither the Veteran nor his attorney provided testimony specifically about that claim at the November 2024 Board hearing, nor was any evidence specific to that claim submitted during the 90 days following.

14. Entitlement to a TDIU rating from September 2020 for decision dated June 18, 2024.

15. Entitlement to SMC ratings, to include under § 1114(s), 1114(l), 1114(p), and 3.350(f)(3)-(4) for decision dated June 18, 2024.

16. Entitlement to a permanent and total rating from September 2020 for decision dated June 18, 2024.

17. Failure to recognize date of claim as September 2020 for decision dated June 18, 2024.

18. Failure to maximize benefits and award highest rating from September 2020 claim for all disability resulting from lung diseases for decision dated June 18, 2024.

As noted above, the June 18, 2024, rating decision awarded entitlement to a TDIU and eligibility for DEA (based on a finding of permanent and total disability), both effective September 28, 2022.  The Board is granting entitlement to the requested earlier effective date (September 3, 2020) for a TDU and DEA eligibility in this decision.  

Also in its June 18, 2024, rating decision, the AOJ denied higher or separate ratings for the Veteran's service-connected respiratory disabilities, but awarded SMC at the housebound rate, effective September 28, 2022.  In this decision, the Board is awarding a 50 percent initial rating for the respiratory disabilities as of September 3, 2020.  At this time, the Board is also able to award an earlier effective date to August 10, 2022, for the SMC award (based on housebound criteria).  The question of whether higher SMC awards, or higher or separate respiratory disability ratings can be granted as of September 3, 2020, will be remanded, as intertwined with the effectuation and implementation of the Board's awards of benefits herein.  

Finally, the Board observes that entitlement to service connection for osteopenia was referenced at the Board hearing as another issue on appeal from the June 18, 2024, rating decision; however, a close review of the Veteran's VA Form 10182 shows that the Veteran did not disagree with the AOJ's denial of that claim.  Accordingly, the matter is not for appellate review at this time.  The Board adds that neither the Veteran nor his attorney provided testimony specifically about that claim at the November 2024 Board hearing, nor was any evidence specific to that claim submitted during the 90 days following.

19. Failure to award SMC(r-1) based on a need for aid and attendance for upper extremities and aid and attendance in lower extremities, in general for all of these rating decisions.

20. Failure to provide § 5104 compliant notice, generally, for all of these rating decisions to include failure to identify favorable findings, failure to properly identify the claim under review, failure to identify all disability resulting from the claimed diseases nad injuries, failure to maximize benefits, and others to be developed at the hearing and in written argument.  

As discussed above, the Veteran's aid and attendance claim was raised by the record during the pendency of the appeal and will be remanded to the AOJ to addressed in the first instance, upon effectuation of the awards granted herein.

The Veteran's final contention generally repeats the assertions made previously and does not raise any new specific contention that has not already been addressed.  The Veteran's attorney clarified the Veteran's contentions at the Board hearing, and he opted not to supplement the file with a post-hearing brief. 

The Board will now more specifically discuss entitlement to the benefits sought on appeal.

1. Entitlement to an effective date of September 3, 2020, for the award of an initial rating of 50 percent for service-connected obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis, is granted.

By way of background, on September 3, 2020, VA received the Veteran's service-connection claim, in pertinent part, for "shortness of breath" and "sleep apnea."  

In a March 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for "shortness of breath" based on medical examination reports attributing the symptom to an undiagnosed illness related to Gulf War service. The AOJ assigned an initial 0 percent rating effective September 3, 2020.  The AOJ rated the disability by analogy to COPD, under Diagnostic Code 6604.  In the same decision, the AOJ deferred adjudication of the Veteran's sleep apnea claim.  

In September 2021, the Veteran filed a claim for increase for his shortness of breath disability.  See the Veteran's September 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The AOJ confirmed and continued the 0 percent rating in a June 2022 rating decision.  

Notably however, the AOJ changed the characterization of the disability to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease "(previously shortness of breath)."  This presumably was based on medical evidence dating in August 2021, which documented the Veteran's complaints of dyspnea, and noted that a CT scan of the chest showed the presence of fibrosis and underlying COPD.  See the Veteran's August 20, 2021, VA CTA Chest - With Contrast, and an August 21, 2021, VA assessment.  A subsequent May 2022 respiratory conditions examiner acknowledged the COPD diagnosis, recognizing the prior August 2021 test results.  

In the June 2022 rating decision, the AOJ also denied the Veteran's service-connection claim for sleep apnea.  The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, appealing that issue to the Board, and in an August 2022 decision, the Board granted the claim.  The AOJ implemented the grant in an August 2022 rating decision.  The AOJ combined sleep apnea with "shortness of breath."  It confirmed a 0 percent initial rating, with an increase to a single 50 percent disability rating for both conditions, effective January 19, 2022.  Cognizant of the regulatory restriction on assigning more than one disability rating for service-connected respiratory disabilities coded under Diagnostic Code 6604 (COPD) and 6847 (sleep apnea syndromes) (see 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(a) (noting that ratings under diagnostic codes 6600 through 6817 and 6822 through 6847 will not be combined with each other)), the AOJ based the increase for both disabilities on the Veteran's need for a continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine for his sleep apnea under Diagnostic Code 6847, as that warranted the greater benefit.  

In October 2022, the Veteran filed a TDIU claim.  On his VA Form 21-8940, he specifically listed shortness of breath (among other disabilities) as a disability that prevented him from securing or following gainful employment.  In a recent precedential decision, the Court of Appeals for Veteran's Claims (the Court) held that because a request for TDIU is not a standalone claim but an attempt to get a higher rating, a VA Form 21-8940 may serve as a supplemental claim when filed after VA has denied higher ratings for the disabilities at issue.  See Chisholm v. Collins, __ Vet.App. __, __; 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (March 13, 2025).  In this connection, because the AOJ had adjudicated the assigned initial rating for the Veteran's respiratory disability in June 2022 (given the Board's grant of the Veteran's September 3, 2020 service-connection claim for sleep apnea, and the AOJ's decision to fold the rating in with previously-established rating for shortness of breath/COPD), and because the Veteran identified shortness of breath as a service-connected disability that contributed to his unemployability on his October 2022 TDIU application, the Board will accept the application as a Supplemental Claim for a higher initial rating for the Veteran's respiratory disability as well.  Doing so permits a finding of continuous pursuit for the assignment of appropriate ratings for the Veteran's combined respiratory disabilities from the date of his September 3, 2020, claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

The AOJ ultimately did treat the Veteran's TDIU claim as a claim for increase of each of the disabilities identified on the TDIU application, to include sleep apnea with shortness of breath.  In the May 17, 2023, rating decision, the AOJ confirmed and continued the 50 percent rating for what it characterized as "obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."  Within one year, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review (HLR) request in March 2024 asking the AOJ to review its May 2023 decision rating his sleep apnea and COPD together as 50 percent disabling.  

In a March 8, 2024, rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for pulmonary fibrosis.  Just as it did with sleep apnea, the AOJ combined the disability with the Veteran's other service-connected disabilities for rating purposes and continued the 50 percent rating currently assigned.  

In the June 18, 2024, HLR rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied entitlement to separate ratings for the Veteran's respiratory conditions, and once again continued the single 50 percent rating (for sleep apnea, COPD and pulmonary fibrosis).  The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182 and argues for higher and separate ratings for his respiratory disabilities.  

As discussed above, there are several arguments or disagreements raised by the Veteran and his attorney with respect to how the Veteran's respiratory conditions have been characterized and rated on appeal.  Insofar as the Veteran seeks recognition of continuous pursuit of the proper rating for his respiratory disabilities since his September 3, 2020, claim, the Board agrees that continuous pursuit of this issue has existed.  This determination favorably impacts the Veteran's TDIU claim, DEA claim and SMC claim, as will be discussed below.  But for purposes of the respiratory disability claim, the question before the Board is indeed, whether the Veteran's disabilities have been appropriately rated from September 3, 2020, to the present. 

The Veteran's attorney has simultaneously argued that the 50 percent rating currently in effect (for all respiratory disabilities) should be made effective September 3, 2020, and also that the Veteran should be awarded a separate rating apart from the 50 percent for what was originally identified as a shortness of breath due to an undiagnosed illness, and subsequently characterized as COPD.  In fact, the Veteran questions ever having been diagnosed with COPD, even though CT scans in August 2021 appear to confirm the diagnosis.  See the November 2024 hearing transcript, at 6-7, 12.

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection based on an initial or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Here the date of claim for service connection for sleep apnea was September 3, 2020.  Though the AOJ combined the Veteran's disability rating with that of the previously-established rating for shortness of breath (which was effective September 3, 2020), it placed the date of recognition for the award of service connection for sleep apnea as May 12, 2021.  This corresponds with the date of a sleep study that showed the presence of severe sleep apnea.  Notably, however, the AOJ never tested the Veteran for sleep apnea at any time between the Veteran's September 3, 2020, date of claim and the May 12, 2021, sleep study.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that the disability was not present at the time he filed his claim.  Accordingly, the Board finds that, to the extent the AOJ did not formally recognize September 3, 2020, as the effective date for the Veteran's service-connection award, such is established by this decision.  See Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015) (where the Court noted that "an effective date should not be assigned mechanically based on the date of a diagnosis.  Rather, all of the facts should be examined to determine the date that the Veteran's disability first manifested.").  

The AOJ did not increase the Veteran's rating from 0 to 50 percent until January 19, 2022.  This date was selected because it was the date the Veteran inquired with VA about possibly needing a CPAP machine.  See a January 19, 2022, VA Primary Care Telephone Encounter Note.  Ultimately, VA medical providers agreed that a CPAP was required, and based that determination on the results of his May 2021 sleep study report, which showed the presence of severe obstructive sleep apnea.  Because a 50 percent rating is warranted under Diagnostic Code 6847 when sleep apnea requires use of a breathing assistance device such as a CPAP machine, the disability rating was increased under that code.  Given that VA medical staff determined a CPAP was required to treat the Veteran's disability based on the severity level shown at the time of his first evaluation (i.e., the May 2021 sleep study), it is reasonable to conclude that the Veteran actually required a CPAP to treat sleep apnea in May 2021.  Because the Veteran filed his claim in September 2020 and did not have an evaluation until May 2021, and because there is no indication that his sleep apnea worsened in severity between the date of claim and the date of first evaluation, the Board will resolve reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor in this case and find that his sleep apnea required the use of a CPAP throughout the appeal period.  

Accordingly, the Veteran's sleep apnea should be recognized as service-connected from September 3, 2020, and the rating for his respiratory conditions should be 50 percent, at the very least, since that date.  Whether higher or separate ratings may be assigned for the Veteran's respiratory disabilities will be discussed in the Remand section below.  

2. Entitlement to an effective date of September 3, 2020, for the award of a TDIU is granted. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date of September 3, 2020, for the award of eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status is granted.

4. Entitlement to an effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of SMC at the housebound rate is granted.

In the June 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal, the AOJ awarded entitlement to a TDIU, entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate, and recognized basic eligibility for DEA based on permanent and total disability status.  All awards were made effective September 28, 2022, consistent with the date VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-8940, Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  The AOJ based its decisions in large part on a finding that the Veteran's service-connected right- and left-hand tremors, and his service-connected unsteadiness of this right and left feet prevented the Veteran from securing or following gainful employment.   

The Veteran seeks an effective date of September 3, 2020, for the award of each benefit.  See the Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182; see also the November 2024 Board hearing transcript, at 9-10.

As discussed above, the Veteran's has continuously pursued a rating claim for his respiratory disabilities from September 3, 2020.  By dint of his September 28, 2022, application for TDIU, upon which the Veteran asserted his shortness of breath may play a role in his inability to work, the question of entitlement to a TDIU was raised and became part and parcel with the pending respiratory rating claim.  In this decision, the Board has increased the Veteran's initial rating for his respiratory disability from 0 to 50 percent, effective September 3, 2020.  This award makes the Veteran eligible on a schedular basis for a TDIU under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) for all times during the appeal period.  

Nothing in the record suggests that the AOJ's favorable finding that service-connected hand and foot disabilities prevented the Veteran from securing and following gainful employment as of the date of the Veteran's September 28, 2022, application, would not also be true as of September 3, 2020.  Indeed, the Veteran had not worked at all for several years prior, and service-connection was in effect for all four extremities at the time.  Accordingly, the Board will grant the benefit sought in this case and assign the TDIU award effective September 3, 2020.

Similarly, recognition of eligibility for DEA is based, in pertinent part, on a finding that the Veteran had a permanent and total service-connected disability or disabilities.  The AOJ favorably found as much in the June 2018 rating decision, based on its recognition of entitlement to a TDIU award.  As the TDIU award is now made effective September 3, 2020, the Board will also recognize eligibility for DEA benefits as of that date as well, in line with the AOJ's favorable finding.

With respect to SMC at the housebound rate, to warrant the benefit under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), the Veteran must be in receipt of a service-connected disability rated as total, and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) by reason of such veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is permanently housebound.  In this case, the AOJ awarded SMC at the housebound rate, recognizing the Veteran's upper and lower extremity disabilities as productive of unemployability (for the total rating), and his other disabilities (including his respiratory disabilities rated as 50 percent disabling, and his rhinitis disability rated at 10 percent disabling) as independently ratable at 60 percent. 

Although the Board has reassigned the effective date for the 50 percent rating to September 3, 2020, service-connection for rhinitis was not established until August 10, 2022.  At this time, the Veteran does not have another compensable service-connected condition which can combine with the 50 percent respiratory disability rating to warrant the SMC award prior to August 10, 2022.  As such, the Board will grant an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of SMC at the housebound rate in this decision, but no earlier.  Entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate prior to August 10, 2022, is intertwined with the issues being remanded, and will be remanded for readjudication below.  

In sum, entitlement to an effective date of September 3, 2020, for the award of a TDIU, and for eligibility for DEA benefits is granted.  Entitlement to an effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of SMC at the housebound rate is also granted.  

5. New and relevant evidence has not been received warranting readjudication of the claim for entitlement to compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for loss of mobility.   

6. New and relevant evidence has not been received warranting readjudication of the claim for entitlement to compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for fatigue.   

7. New and relevant evidence has not been received warranting readjudication of the claim for entitlement to compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for vertigo.   

On or after February 19, 2019, a Veteran may file a supplemental claim any time after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, as the evidentiary record closes upon issuance of the notice, subject to later readjudicating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501, 19.2.  If new and relevant evidence is presented with respect to the supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501. 

Evidence is new and relevant evidence if it (1) was not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators and, (2) tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).  New and relevant evidence received before VA issues its decision on a supplemental claim will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(2).  

By way of background, in September 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ requesting compensation for, among other things, vertigo, loss of mobility, and fatigue as due to VA treatment earlier in the year.  Specifically, he related these conditions to complications after having a post-colonoscopy GI-bleed in August 2021 that required an additional procedure.  

The AOJ obtained the Veteran's VA medical records after receiving the Veteran's claim.  These records document that the Veteran underwent a colonoscopy on August 16, 2021, and started having shortness of breath in the days thereafter.  He went to the emergency room, and a CT scan of the chest showed no embolism at the time (for which he had a prior history), but some fibrosis and chronic COPD, which are already recognized as service-connected disabilities.  He started experiencing GI bleeding on August 21, 2021, after passing a bloody bowel movement.  He was seen at VA, and a second look colonoscopy was performed, and a biopsy cite was clipped.  He was observed for two more days and discharged in stable condition.  The treatment notes indicated the condition resolved after the re-look colonoscopy with surgical clipping.  It was noted that the bleed likely was secondary to polyp removal in the setting of anticoagulant use (for his prior pulmonary embolism).  He resumed home anticoagulation therapy without any more episodes of lower GI bleeding.  See a September 10, 2021, VA Primary Care E&M Note.   

A November 24, 2021, VA treatment report included correspondence from the Veteran asking for information about his iron levels, noting that the problems that started after his colonoscopy were helped by the corrective surgery, but he still would get tired easily and get light-headed with exertion or when bending down.  

After obtaining these records of VA care, as well as medical examinations and medical opinions addressing potential VA negligence and foreseeability, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claims in a June 2022 rating decision.  The denials were based on lack of evidence of an additional disability related to negligent VA care, or as a result of an event that could not have reasonably been foreseen by a reasonable healthcare provider.   

The Veteran did not seek additional review of the June 2022 rating decision.  On July 31, 2023, VA received the Veteran's Supplemental Claim, requesting readjudication of the previously-denied § 1151 claims for loss of mobility, vertigo and fatigue.   

Although several updated records of VA care were added to the claims file, neither the Veteran nor his attorney submitted any additional evidence since the June 2022 decision in support of these § 1151 claims.  In the May 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that new and relevant evidence had not been received warranting readjudication of the claims.  

The Board has reviewed the evidence that has been added to the claims file from the time of the prior June 2022 rating decision to the release of May 2024 rating decision, as well as at the November 2024 hearing and within 90 days following the hearing.  At no point has evidence been received that is relevant to a matter at issue.  The added records of VA care do not discuss the question of negligent VA care in August 2021, and they otherwise attribute symptoms of fatigue, vertigo or loss of mobility to the Veteran's August 2021 colonoscopy or corrective surgery.  Notably, when discussed at the Veteran's November 2024 hearing, the Veteran and his attorney offered no testimony or argument specific to the § 1151 claims, nor was additional evidence relevant to the matter added after the hearing.  As noted above, the Veteran's attorney simply stated, "[w]ith respect to 1151 claims, these were all disabilities that resulted from his undiagnosed illness."  See the November 2024 Board hearing transcript, at 13.  While on the Veteran's VA Form 10182, the Veteran's attorney asserted that the AOJ failed to follow 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(2), he did not point to any specific evidence that the AOJ overlooked that would be considered new and relevant, and the Board has not otherwise identified such evidence.  

Accordingly, new and relevant evidence has not been received warranting readjudication of the Veteran's claims for compensation for vertigo, fatigue and loss of mobility under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151.  Thus, the Veteran's petitions to readjudicate his claims § 1151 claims as to these conditions are denied.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

8. Entitlement to an initial rating greater than 50 percent for the Veteran's service-connected obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis, to include whether separate ratings are warranted for his service-connected respiratory disabilities is remanded.  

The Veteran requests Board review of a March 8, 2024, decision that awarded service-connection for fibrosis, but did not otherwise increase or award a separate rating for the Veteran's respiratory conditions, which the AOJ has rated together pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(a).  Similarly, the Veteran requests Board review of a June 18, 2024, HLR decision, which similarly denied entitlement to separate and higher ratings for the Veteran's respiratory disability.  The same issue has essentially been appealed twice.  

Currently, the Veteran's service-connected respiratory disabilities include sleep apnea (Diagnostic Code 6847), COPD (previously characterized as shortness of breath due to an undiagnosed illness) (Diagnostic Code 6604), and pulmonary fibrosis (Diagnostic Code 6845).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(a), ratings under diagnostic codes 6600 through 6817 and 6822 through 6847 will not be combined with each other.  A single rating will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.

In this decision, the Board has granted the Veteran's claim, insofar has he and his attorney specifically requested that the single rating of 50 percent, currently assigned (based on the disabling effects of sleep apnea), be made effective September 3, 2020.  However, this award does not fully resolve the Veteran's appeal, as he has asked for higher and separate ratings for his conditions.

The issue must be remanded to correct pre-decisional duty-to-assist errors.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

First, as discussed above, the AOJ originally awarded service connection for an undiagnosed illness, manifesting in shortness of breath, based on a February 2021 medical examination and opinion.  See the AOJ's March 2021 rating decision.  It appears that after the Veteran was diagnosed with COPD on August 20, 2021, at VA's medical facilities following a CT scan, the AOJ started referring to the Veteran's service-connected undiagnosed illness as COPD.  In fact, as pointed out by the Veteran's attorney at the November 2024 hearing, the AOJ initially rated the symptoms associated with shortness of breath under the COPD Diagnostic Criteria by analogy.  The Veteran's Codesheet now specifically lists COPD as a service-connected disability.  

However, the reviewable evidence of record did not make clear whether the Veteran's COPD is separate and distinct from the previously-identified undiagnosed illness similarly manifesting in shortness of breath, or, instead, if the undiagnosed illness was later determined to actually be COPD.  As the Veteran and his attorney have argued that he should be rated separately for what was originally service connected as an "undiagnosed illness" and recharacterized as COPD, the AOJ should have sought clarification as to whether the undiagnosed illness was subsequently medically determined to be COPD, or whether a separate disease entity manifesting in shortness of breath exists.  On remand, an examination should be scheduled, and an opinion obtained to address this pre-decisional duty to assist error.  

Second, the reviewable evidence shows that, in addition to service-connected sleep apnea, COPD and fibrosis, the Veteran also has a diagnosis of nonservice-connected pulmonary embolism.  The February 2021 respiratory examination identified the condition, and indicated that such was "symptomatic, following resolution of acute pulmonary embolism" and such was chronic, requiring anticoagulant therapy.  An April 2022 respiratory examination noted the Veteran's reported history of having shortness of breath in 2008, followed by hospitalization for a pulmonary embolism, with worsening shortness of breath since onset.  The Veteran reported he was diagnosed with COPD and told he had some fibrosis in 2021.  

At a December 2022 respiratory examination, the examiner diagnosed pulmonary embolism and pulmonary fibrosis, characterizing the embolism as symptomatic, chronic and requiring anticoagulant therapy.  The examiner noted the presence of shortness of breath with exertion related to the diagnoses.  The examiner also indicated that the conditions predominately responsible for limitation in pulmonary function was COPD, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary fibrosis. 

Crucially, at a March 2023 respiratory examination, the examiner specifically listed "fibrosis" under Part D, which concerns "Pulmonary Embolism and Related Diseases."    

Prior to adjudicating the May 2023 rating decision (which was subject to the June 2024 HLR on appeal), and prior to the March 8, 2024, rating decision on appeal, the evidence raised the question as to whether the Veteran's pulmonary embolism may be related to his other service-connected respiratory conditions, either by causation or aggravation.  Although the AOJ obtained medical opinions addressing whether the Veteran's embolism was directly related to service, the evidence above raised the question of whether a secondary relationship may exist.  In Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188 (2021), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that "VA is required to develop and adjudicate related claims for secondary service connection for disabilities that are reasonably raised during the adjudication of a formally initiated claim for the proper evaluation level for the primary service-connected disability."  On remand, the AOJ should ensure an adequate medical opinion addressing secondary service connection is obtained.  Should a connection be established, such may have a bearing on the way the Veteran's service-connected respiratory disabilities are rated.  

9. Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for essential tremors of the left hand is remanded.  

10. Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for essential tremors of the right hand is remanded.  

11. Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for an undiagnosed illness, manifesting in unsteadiness of the left foot is remanded.

12. Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for an undiagnosed illness, manifesting in unsteadiness of the right foot is remanded.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that these issues must be remanded to correct pre-decisional duty-to-assist errors under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

By way of background, the AOJ awarded service connection for essential tremors of the right and left hand, and an undiagnosed illness manifesting in unsteadiness of the right and left foot in a June 2021 rating decision.  Based on medical evidence at the time, the Veteran's tremors were considered to be a diagnosable illness of unknown etiology, and the Veteran's instability of the feet was considered to be an undiagnosed illness.  See a June 2021 examiner's medical opinion.  The AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for both disabilities based on a legal presumption that they were related to the Veteran's Persian Gulf service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  Notably, an April 2021 Peripheral Nerve examination only identified the presence of "unsteadiness of the feet" and noted no impairment to any upper or lower extremity peripheral nerve.  The examiner specifically noted that the Veteran did not have a peripheral nerve problem.  Essential tremors were diagnosed at an April 2021 central nervous system and neuromuscular diseases examination, but testing showed normal strength and reflexes of the upper extremities.  

The AOJ assigned initial 10 percent ratings by analogy under the criteria pertaining to Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124(a).  The Veteran's right- and left-hand tremors were rated as analogous to incomplete paralysis of the median nerve under Diagnostic Code 8515, and his right and left foot undiagnosed illnesses were rated as analogous to incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve under Diagnostic Code 8520.  

It appears the AOJ has accepted the Veteran's July 18, 2022, VA 21-526EZ as a request for increased ratings for each disability.  The Veteran appeared at a March 2023 peripheral nerves examination, where the Veteran's service-connected hand and feet disabilities were acknowledged.  Symptoms were described as "progressed/worsened" and the Veteran reported he could not climb stairs without assistance and had a tremor in both hands.  The examiner indicated "no" when asked if the Veteran had any symptoms attributable to any peripheral nerve conditions.  Peripheral nerves, to include the median and sciatic nerves, were considered "normal."  Nevertheless, the examiner reported that the Veteran's unsteadiness on his feet would "preclude him from a job and his tremor in bilateral hands would preclude any employment requiring use of fine motor skills."

The Veteran appeared for an August 2023 central nervous system examination, where the Veteran's service-connected hand and feet disabilities were again acknowledged.  The Veteran reported worsening symptoms, now having problems feeding, dropping items, problems writing, and small detail work like buttoning a button.  He indicated his wife was required to assist with meals, bathing and dressing.   Upon neurologic examination, the Veteran was noted to have an abnormal, unsteady gait.  Strength testing and reflex testing was normal.  No muscle weakness was identified.  The examiner indicated that there is a "worsening of the Veteran's symptoms; however, no change to the service-connected diagnosis and no additional diagnoses have been rendered." 

In a September 2023 opinion, an examiner discussed the impact the Veteran's hand and foot disabilities had on his ability to work, noting limitations in climbing stairs, excessive walking, carrying heavy objects, and limitations in performing a desk job requiring a significant amount of writing.  The Board notes that the AOJ ultimately awarded entitlement to a TDIU based largely on this assessment.  See the AOJ's June 2024 rating decision. 

In an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ proposed to reduce the Veteran's hand and foot ratings from 10 to 0 percent based on observations that the prior examinations showed "asymptomatic incomplete paralysis" of each extremity.  In other words, notwithstanding the functional impairment specifically discussed by each examiner highlighted above, the AOJ appeared to focus exclusively on whether the specific rating criteria under the peripheral nerve codes at issue (8515, 8520) were met.  

The Veteran requested a pre-determination hearing with the AOJ regarding the proposed reductions.  Prior to that hearing, the AOJ requested a clarifying medical opinion in an attempt to better understand impairment caused by the Veteran's disabilities, based on record review.  A January 2024 medical opinion provider indicated that the Veteran's disability required assistance with fine detail work, eating and dressing.  The opinion provider stated, "I am unable to determine the severity of the [V]eteran's upper extremity weakness without resorting to speculation as this is an Independent Medical Opinion.  The Veteran would need to attend a [face-to-face] appointment in order for this to be determined."

In February 2024, the Veteran and his attorney appeared for the AOJ pre-determination hearing.  The Veteran's attorney pointed out the Veteran's hand and feet disabilities were rated by analogy to peripheral nerve codes, that no actual disability of the peripheral nerves had been medically identified, and that the reduction was improperly based on failure to meet the specific criteria outlined for the peripheral nerve codes.  Moreover, the Veteran's attorney argued that, if anything, the prior examination reports support a finding of worsening impairment, and not improvement.  The AOJ hearing officer suggested there appeared to be contradictions within the prior examination reports insofar as functional impairment was described without specific impairment of an actual nerve problem.  The hearing officer suggested a need for another examination, but because the specific issue being discussed at the time pertained to the propriety of the proposed reduction, the Veteran's attorney argued that no such examination should be scheduled; rather, he argued the reduction simply should not be effectuated because there was reasonable doubt as to whether improvement actually occurred.

In the March 21, 2024, rating decision on appeal, the AOJ continued the 10 percent ratings under the peripheral nerve Diagnostic Codes, without reduction.  The AOJ highlighted the fact that the prior examiner stated that discrepancies in the record could not be reconciled without reexamination.  For that reason, the proposal to reduce was withdrawn.  The AOJ then specifically stated, "[a] higher evaluation is not warranted without attending another evaluation," that the 10 percent ratings were based on "mild incomplete paralysis" of the median and sciatic nerves, and that higher 20 percent ratings were not warranted unless evidence showed nerve damage that was moderate.  

Although there is no reduction question at issue, the Veteran has timely disagreed with the AOJ's denial of higher ratings for the hands and feet.  While it may not have been necessary to obtain clarifying examinations to determine a reduction was not warranted, as was argued by the Veteran's attorney at the February 2024 hearing, the AOJ should have done so before denying the Veteran's request for higher ratings.  By its own analysis, additional examinations were necessary to reconcile prior seemingly contradicting findings, and to adequately address the impairment caused by the Veteran's disabilities even if neurologic testing appears to be "normal."  

On remand, appropriate examinations should be scheduled, to include foot and hand examinations (separate from neurological examinations) to better understand the impairment caused by the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, such that an appropriate analogous rating can be assigned under the Rating Schedule.  

The AOJ should keep in mind that the Court of Appeals for Federal Circuit has held that an unlisted condition need not identically match the criteria of the listed condition to which it is rated by analogy.  See Webb v. McDonough, 71 F.4th 1377 (2023).  Upon readjudication of the rating claims, the AOJ should consider utilizing any applicable code or codes that best contemplate the Veteran's symptoms and impaired function. 

13. Entitlement to SMC at the highest level, to include specifically based on the need for the aid and attendance of another, and/or at the housebound rate prior to August 10, 2022, is remanded. 

As discussed above, the evidence of record prior to the March 21, 2024, rating decision on appeal (pertaining to the propriety of the ratings for the Veteran's hand and foot disabilities) reasonably raised the issue of whether the Veteran may be entitlement to SMC based on the need for the aid and attendance of another.  See e.g., an August 23, 2023, central nervous system examination (noting the Veteran's wife was required to assist with meals, bathing and dressing).  

In Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118 (1991), the Court held that the issue of entitlement to SMC is part and parcel of a claim for increased compensation and does not require submission of a separate claim.  Here, the AOJ should have addressed the matter with the Veteran's rating claim.  The Veteran has specifically argued that the AOJ should have expanded the scope of the Veteran's rating claims to include consideration of SMC based on a need for aid and attendance, as well as any higher level of SMC that might be available based on the level of severity of his conditions. 

The Board has granted several benefits in this decision, and the implementation of the awards may impact the Veteran's specific SMC claims.  In addition, additional development is required before informed decisions can be made regarding other pending claims.  As such, entitlement to SMC at any level, to include entitlement based on the need for the aid and attendance of another, and/or at the housebound rate prior to August 10, 2022, is remanded insofar as such was raised prior to March 21, 2024, rating decision on appeal, and because the issue is intertwined with the favorable actions and development ordered herein.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a respiratory examination to assess the nature and severity of each of his service-connected disabilities, which currently include obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis.  The examiner should review the Veteran's medical records and take a history from the Veteran as to the progression of his symptoms.  

Upon review of the record, interview and examination of the Veteran, the examiner should respond to each of the following:

(a)	Does the Veteran have an undiagnosed illness manifesting in shortness of breath (as identified upon examination in February 2021) that is separate and distinct from his COPD?  Was the undiagnosed illness identified upon examination in February 2021 later determined to actually be COPD?  Please explain.

(b)	Ensure that an adequate medical opinion has been obtained and associated with the claims file addressing whether the Veteran's pulmonary embolism is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to any or all of his service-connected respiratory disabilities, either by causation or aggravation.  An adequate opinion should address whether the Veteran's pulmonary embolism disability would have been less severe "but-for" his service-connected respiratory disabilities, to include either because there is an etiological link or because the service-connected disabilities resulted in the inability to treat the embolism.

(c)	Regardless of whether the pulmonary embolism is related to service-connected disabilities, please distinguish, to the extent possible, symptoms and impairments among the identified disabilities.  If some symptoms overlap and cannot be distinguished, please identify those symptoms.  

All opinions should be supported by a medical explanation or rationale.

2. Schedule the Veteran for hand and foot examinations, and any other examinations deemed appropriate or necessary to understand and assess the severity of the Veteran's right- and left-hand tremors, and his right and left foot undiagnosed illness, manifesting in unsteadiness.  Each examiner should review the Veteran's medical records and take a history from the Veteran as to the progression of his symptoms.  Examination should not be limited to neurological assessments alone.  If normal objective test results do not appear to be consistent with actual functional impairment or loss (demonstrated or described), the examiner should provide information to account for such discrepancy, if possible.
