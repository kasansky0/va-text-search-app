ORDER

The appeal as to the matter of whether a debt in the total calculated amount of $3,459.70, resulting from the overpayment of monthly housing allowance benefits and books and supplies stipends under Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (known as the Post-9/11 GI Bill), was properly created is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In January 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) determined that the debts in the total amounts of $3,209.70 and $250.00, resulting from the indicated overpayments of monthly housing allowance benefits and books and supplies stipends, respectively, under the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, was invalid; the debts were removed from the Veteran's record.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to the issue of whether a debt in the total calculated amount of $3,459.70, resulting from the overpayment of monthly housing allowance benefits and books and supplies stipends under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, was properly created, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from April 1982 to September 1985.  He then served in the United States Army National Guard, which service included periods of active duty from October 1, 2003, to May 5, 2005, from February 11, 2009, to November 7, 2010, and from September 1, 2011, to August 31, 2021.

On December 23, 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in which he stated he was disagreeing with a July 2020 decision.  The Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or his representative, with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

A review of the record shows that the Veteran was in receipt of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits for undergraduate degree program at University of Phoenix-San Antonio and that he received monthly housing allowances for the terms running from November 29, 2010, to January 10, 2011, and from January 18 to from February 15, 2011.  The total housing allowance benefits paid for these two terms was $3,209.70; a books and supplies stipend in the total amount of $250.00 for these terms was also paid.  The AOJ initially determined that because the Veteran had received monthly housing allowance benefits and books and supplies stipends while serving on active duty, he was overpaid such benefits in the total calculated amount of $3,459.70.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3313.

Via letter dated January 4, 2021, however, the AOJ informed the Veteran that VA subsequently determined that the debt in the amount of $3,459.70 was not properly created.  Specifically, the letter stated that the Veteran's DD Form 214 showing that he had been released from active duty on November 7, 2010, meant that he was not active duty during the terms in question.  The AOJ went on to state that the "previous debts that were explained in our letter dated July 15, 2020, are no longer valid" and that the Veteran "will have no outstanding debts on [his] record."

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  As the original debt charged to the Veteran was subsequently determined to be invalid and the debts have been cleared from the Veteran's record, there remains no adverse action for the Board to adjudicate.  Accordingly, the Board is without jurisdiction to review the appeal with respect to this issue, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.
