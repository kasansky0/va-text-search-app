ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable (greater than 0 percent) disability rating for right knee limitation of extension is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's right knee limitation of extension did not manifest to 10 degrees or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a compensable (greater than 0 percent) disability rating for right knee limitation of extension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.31, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5261.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2016 through October 2021 in the United States Army.? 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.?? 

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement: VA Form 10182 and selected the Direct Review docket. Based on that docket selection, the Board is limited in its review of the evidence and may only consider the evidence of record at the time the January 2024 rating decision on appeal was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after that decision on appeal was issued the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R.§§ 20.300, 20.801.??? 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim: VA Form 20-0995 and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C.? § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.??? 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. 

Entitlement to a compensable (greater than 0 percent) disability rating for right knee limitation of extension is denied.

Factual Background

An October 2023 VA examination notes that the Veteran reported post-surgery residual pain in his right knee. The Veteran also reported flare-ups intermittently throughout the day. The flare-ups are characterized by a stabbing pain and are typically brought on by prolonged walking and standing as well as squatting down. The Veteran also reported functional loss in the form of requiring sitting down in order to alleviate the pain. There were no reports of instability, subluxation, or effusion of the knee. The Veteran's active range of motion was calculated as being at 75 degrees on flexion, with pain noted; and 0 degrees on extension with no pain noted. The Veteran's passive range of motion was calculated as being at 85 degrees on flexion, with pain noted; and 0 degrees on extension with no pain noted. The Veteran's range of motion after repetitive use testing was calculated as being at 70 degrees on flexion and 0 degrees on extension with pain noted. The examiner estimated the Veteran's range of motion during a flare up to be at 65 degrees on flexion and 0 degrees on extension. The Veteran was noted as having no muscle atrophy or ankylosis of the right knee.

A January 2024 VA examination notes that the Veteran again reported post-surgery residual pain as well as intermittent flare-ups which cause a stabbing pain. There were no reports of instability, subluxation, or effusion of the knee. The Veteran's active range of motion was calculated as being at 60 degrees on flexion, with pain noted; and 0 degrees on extension with no pain noted. The Veteran's passive range of motion was calculated as being at 65 degrees on flexion, with pain noted; and 0 degrees on extension with no pain noted. The Veteran's range of motion after repetitive use testing was calculated as being at 60 degrees on flexion and 0 degrees on extension with pain noted. The examiner estimated the Veteran's range of motion during a flare up to be at 55 degrees on flexion and 0 degrees on extension. The Veteran was noted as having no muscle atrophy or ankylosis of the right knee.

Analysis

The Veteran's right knee limitation of extension is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261, for limitation of extension of the leg. Under DC 5261, a noncompensable rating is warranted for extension limited to 5 degrees. A 10 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 10 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 15 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 20 degrees. A 40 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 30 degrees. A 50 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, may not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the Veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."   

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the Veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for the Veteran's right knee limitation of extension. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, pain during flare-ups, and pain during repetitive use over time. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating extension limited to 10 degrees.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the knee and leg. Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).  

In this case, the VA Regional Office assigned a minimum 10 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 5260 for limitation of flexion based on the Veteran's associated pain under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 and taking into consideration the factors under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45. The Board finds the Veteran's descriptions of the severity, duration, and frequency of pain, weakness, fatigue, and incoordination associated with his right knee disability are properly captured by his assigned 10 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 5260.

The Board points out that the Veteran is not entitled to two individual ratings under Diagnostic Code 5260 and Diagnostic Code 5261 for his right knee pain because the symptom is not separate and distinct as applied to each diagnostic code. That is, the Veteran does not have distinct pain on flexion that is separate from his pain on extension. Rather, his pain is one entity. Thus, the VA Regional Office's choice to rate his pain under only Diagnostic Code 5260 is valid. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 (prohibiting duplicate compensation for the same manifestation (i.e., symptom) of disability under different diagnoses, known as "pyramiding"); see generally Boggs v. Peake, 520 F.3d 1330, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("[A] Veteran cannot be compensated more than once for the same disability."). This finding is consistent with the examination results, which, for the most part, showed no pain upon extension.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for right knee limitation of extension. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).
