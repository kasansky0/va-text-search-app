REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force from September 2011 through November 2016, to include Gulf War Era service.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February 2023 and October 2020 rating decisions. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 and October 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.    

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the February 2023 and October 2020 decisions, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision addressing the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Law and Analysis

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(a)(1)(ii) and 20.202, a Veteran may appeal a rating decision to the Board on the form prescribed by the Secretary, in this case a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) within one year after the date of the mailing of the letter notifying the Veteran of the rating decision. On the Veteran's April 2024 Notice of Disagreement, he indicated that he is appealing the issues of service connection for carpal tunnel syndrome, left elbow condition, right elbow condition, and left shoulder condition, which were last denied in a February 2023 rating decision, as well as service connection for depression, which was last denied in an October 2020 rating decision. 

Review of the Veteran's record reflects that he filed a VA Form 526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) for service connection for depression and paranoid reaction in May 2020, which was denied in an October 20, 2020 rating decision. A notification letter of the October 20, 2020 rating decision was mailed to the Veteran on October 22, 2020, which included instructions regarding next steps should the Veteran disagree with the rating decision. The instructions included an explanation that the Veteran had one year from the date of the notification letter to file any required application forms in conjunction with a desired review option. 

The Veteran also filed a VA Form 526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) for service connection for carpal tunnel syndrome, left elbow condition, right elbow condition, and a left shoulder condition in July 2021. These claims were denied in a February 16, 2023 rating decision. A notification letter of the February 16, 2023 rating decision was mailed to the Veteran on February 27, 2023, which included instructions regarding next steps should the Veteran disagree with the rating decision. The instructions included an explanation that the Veteran had one year from the date of the notification letter to file any required application forms in conjunction with a desired review option.

There is no indication in the Veteran's record that he did not receive the notification letters pertaining to the October 2020 and February 2023 rating decisions. As the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement was submitted one year and two months after the February 2023 rating decision, and over three years after the October 2020 rating decision, his appeal concerning service connection for carpal tunnel syndrome, left elbow condition, right elbow condition, left shoulder condition, and depression is not timely. 

The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may dismiss an appeal for non-compliance with essential claims-processing rules. See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021); Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (while the Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction due to an untimely filing of an appeal, it may dismiss the appeal due to non-jurisdictional reasons, such as procedural defects, where the claimant did not substantially comply with proper claims processing rules).  Here, the Board finds that the Notice of Disagreement is untimely and therefore procedurally deficient.

In cases where a Notice of Disagreement is not timely filed, a claimant may request an extension of the period for filing an appeal for good cause, and the Board my grant an extension of the time to file and accept the VA Form 10182 as timely filed where good cause has been shown. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c). A request for such extension must be in writing and filed with the Board. Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203. 

In this case, the Veteran has not asserted, and the record does not reflect, that either the Veteran or his representative filed a request for an extension at any time during the one-year period to file a Notice of Disagreement. Additionally, the Veteran has not provided any statements indicating why his Notice of Disagreement was untimely, to include any indications of good cause. While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's request, the law is dispositive, and the Board is bound by the laws and regulations governing VA benefits. The Board may only grant entitlement to VA benefits authorized by law and does not have authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c). 

As good cause has not been shown for the untimely filing of the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement, and the Veterans Notice of Disagreement was not timely filed, the appeal must be dismissed.
