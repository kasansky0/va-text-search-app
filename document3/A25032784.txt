ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder is related to his military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from April 1976 to June 1979.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2024 Higher Level Review rating decision issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to conform with the evidence of record. See Clemons v. Shinseki. 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

Furthermore, as an initial matter, the Board acknowledges that the Board is issuing a decision on this appeal before the deadline for requesting an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) (allowing a claimant to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new Notice of Disagreement (NOD) within one year from the date AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives the NOD, whichever is later; unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303). However, in the instant case, as the Board is awarding the full relief sought by the Veteran, there is no prejudice in adjudicating this claim at this time.

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder, is granted.

The Veteran asserts that his psychiatric disorder is due to military sexual trauma (MST) in October 1976 while he was stationed in Misawa, Japan. See May 2023 VA Form 21-0781a.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection generally requires evidence showing (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Regarding the first element of service connection, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder, and this finding is not clearly and unmistakably erroneous. See July 2022 C&P Exam; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Regarding the second element of service connection, the Veteran has provided credible evidence to corroborate his claimed in-service MST. He has consistently described the same 1976 incident of MST, including during treatment, at his VA psychiatric examination, and in his May 2023 VA Form 21-0781a. The Veteran has submitted credible evidence of behavior changes following the claimed personal assault, including service treatment records showing the Veteran's use of drugs and alcohol beginning in 1976, after the incident, of having low performance records in July 1977, and being medically evacuated from Japan due to drug and alcohol difficulties in May 1979. See, e.g., January 1979 Military Personnel Record at 28; May 1979 STR at 12. The Veteran endorsed MST on VA PTSD and depression screenings in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. See July 2022 VA examinations. Moreover, the July 2022 VA examiner's opinion, acknowledging "markers of behavioral change" during service, constitutes supporting evidence of the in-service MST. See Menegassi v. Shinseki, 683 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (observing that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims erred when it determined that a medical opinion based on a post-service examination of a Veteran cannot be used to establish the occurrence of a stressor). Specifically, the July 2022 VA examiner found the Veteran's history of substance abuse was a behavioral marker of the in-service personal assault. Accordingly, resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board concedes in-service MST. 

Regarding the third element of service connection, the July 2022 VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder "is at least as likely as not caused by the MST," citing the Veteran's lay statements regarding the stressor and in-service markers of behavioral change. There is no competent opinion to the contrary.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder is due to his in-service MST, and as such, service connection is warranted. Therefore, the Board resolves all doubt in his favor and finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is granted.  38 U.S.C.           § 5107, 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
