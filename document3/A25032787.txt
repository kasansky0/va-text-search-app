DOCKET NO. 211022-192880
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is dismissed.

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for malignant growths of the skin (claimed as skin cancer (melanoma)) is dismissed.

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for residual scars associated with skin cancer is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The March 2020 letter informing the Veteran that he needed to file his claims of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, skin cancer, and residual scars on the correct form was not an adjudicative determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the claim of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the claim of service connection for malignant growths of the skin (claimed as skin cancer (melanoma)) are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

3. The criteria for dismissal of the claim of service connection for residual scars associated with skin are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from October 1987 to October 1993.  

In an October 2021 NOD, the Veteran elected an appeal to the Board, using the Board hearing docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  On the hearing docket, the Board considers the same record as that considered by the AOJ, as well as evidence submitted at a Board hearing and during the 90-day period following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

The Veteran and his spouse testified at an April 2025 hearing before the undersigned; this decision is being issued prior to association of a transcript with the claim file, but the Veteran is not prejudiced.  Specifically, the procedural defect was discussed in detail, and the Veteran was made aware of, and agreed with, the need for dismissal. The undersigned also endorsed the idea that in light of the procedural error by the Board in docketing the appeal mistakenly, the time to formalize the March 2020 claim discussed below should be tolled.

The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) shall not entertain an application for review on appeal unless it conforms to the law.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7108.  Appellate review shall be initiated by the filing of an NOD in the form prescribed by the Secretary.  An appeal consists of a notice of disagreement timely filed to the Board on any issue for which VA provided notice of a decision under 38 U.S.C. § 5104 affecting the provision of VA benefits.  38 C.F.R. § 20.4.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 511.  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

It is a well-established judicial precedent that when there is no case or controversy, or when a once live case or controversy becomes moot, the Board lacks authority to review the matter.  Bond v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 376, 377 (1992); Mokal v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 12, 15 (1990).

By way of history, in a November 2016 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for skin cancer (melanoma) with scars and service connection for sleeping issues.  The Veteran did not timely appeal or submit new and material evidence within one year of the denial.  The November 2016 rating decision therefore became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).

In a March 2020 Fully Developed Claim (VA 21-526EZ), the Veteran sought to reopen the claims of service connection for sleep apnea (previously claimed as sleep issues) and service connection for skin cancer.  

Shortly thereafter, on March 18, 2020, the AOJ acknowledged receipt of the March 2020 Fully Developed Claim.  The AOJ, however, informed the Veteran that VA regulations required that the request be filed on a proper form.  The notification letter further noted that the claims were previously denied by the AOJ and instructed the Veteran as to which form to file.  The Veteran initially filed a NOD to the letter in April 2020 but was informed in June 2020 that VA had not issued a decision under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) for which a NOD could be filed.  Thereafter, the record in June 2021 and October 2021 reflects that the Veteran contacted VA regarding the status of his appeal but was informed that there was no active appeal concerning the claims listed on his April 2020 NOD.  In October 2021, the Veteran resubmitted the April 2020 NOD.  

38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a) defines a complete claim as "a submission of an application form prescribed by the Secretary."  Here, the Veteran did not submit such a claim for review of his previously denied claims of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea and service connection for skin cancer with residual scars.  As a result, the AOJ did not decide whether the Veteran was entitled to such compensation.  Rather, in March 2020, the AOJ directed the Veteran to file his claims on a proper form.  In that letter, the Veteran was informed that a VA Form 10182 could be properly filed when VA had decided on the claimed issues on or after February 19, 2019.  As referenced above, the claims of service connection were previously denied in a November 2016 rating decision.  As such, a VA Form 10182 was not a proper form for these claims.

The Board acknowledges that in his NOD, the Veteran identified the date of decision he sought to appeal as March 19, 2020.  The claims file shows no determinations or other correspondence regarding obstructive sleep apnea, skin cancer, or residual scars of skin cancer in March 2020.  However, the claims file does show that the Veteran filed claims for sleep apnea and service connection for skin cancer in a March 2020 Fully Developed Claim and was notified by letter on March 18, 2020, that he needed to file his requests regarding sleep apnea and skin cancer with scars on the proper form.  The Board need not determine whether the March 19, 2020, date was a scrivener's error, as there was no adjudicative determination by the AOJ in March 2020 regarding the Veteran's claims of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, service connection for skin cancer, or service connection for residual scars associated with skin cancer, and therefore, no question of law of fact for the Board's consideration.

Therefore, this appeal is not properly before the Board for consideration as there is no question of law or fact, and it is dismissed.

The Board is aware that correspondence was sent to the Veteran indicating the instant appeal was docketed, which may have led him to believe that his claims of service connection would be considered.  The procedural defect of disagreement prior to filing a complete claim, however, does not allow the Board to accept the NOD.  The impact of Board and VA correspondence should be considered should the Veteran attempt to refile a proper claim, however.
