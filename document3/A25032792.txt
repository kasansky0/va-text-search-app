REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from May 1975 to May 1995, to include service in Southwest Asia.  The Board notes that the rating decisions on appeal were issued in March and April 2024.  In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March and April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for IGH, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board must discuss all theories of entitlement raised by the Veteran or by the evidence of record.  Robinson v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 545 (2008).

Accordingly, the Board has recharacterized the claims as indicated above to afford the Veteran the broadest possible scope of review.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5-6 (2009).

Service Connection Claims

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.  Id.; also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) [(table)].

Where a Veteran served for at least 90 days during a period of war or after December 31, 1946, and manifests certain chronic diseases to a degree of 10 percent within one year, from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  In an October 4, 1995, opinion, VA's Under Secretary for Health determined that it was appropriate to consider high frequency sensorineural hearing loss an organic disease of the nervous system and therefore a presumptive disability.

Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).  However, the use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited only to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a) and does not apply to other disabilities which might be considered chronic from a medical standpoint.  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) proximately caused by or (b) proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc).  Furthermore, service connection may not be awarded on the basis of aggravation without establishing a pre-aggravation baseline level of disability and comparing it to the current level of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (b).

Service connection may also be granted for a disability due to a qualifying chronic disability of a Veteran who served in the Southwest Asia Theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War provided that such disability became manifest during either active service in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations during the Persian Gulf War or to a degree of 10 percent or more, under the appropriate diagnostic code of 38 C.F.R. Part 4, not later than December 31, 2021, and by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, the disability cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis.  38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(1).

In the instant case, the record reflects that the Veteran had service in Southwest Asia theater of operations and, therefore, such laws and regulations are applicable to his claims.

A chronic qualifying disability means a chronic disability resulting from an (A) undiagnosed illness; (B) the following medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illnesses that are defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms: (1) chronic fatigue syndrome; (2) fibromyalgia; (3) IBS; or (4) any other illness that the Secretary determines meets the criteria in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for a medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness; or (C) any diagnosed illness that the Secretary determines in regulations prescribed under 38 U.S.C. § 1117 (d) warrants a presumption of service connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(2)(i).

For the purposes of this section the term medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness means a diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology, that is characterized by overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory abnormalities.  Chronic multisymptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology will not be considered medically unexplained.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(2)(ii).

"Objective indications of chronic disability" include both "signs," in the medical sense of objective evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical indicators that are capable of independent verification. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(3).

Disabilities that have existed for 6 months or more and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of improvement and worsening over a 6-month period will be considered chronic.  The 6-month period of chronicity will be measured from the earliest date on which the pertinent evidence establishes that the signs or symptoms of the disability first became manifest.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(4).

Signs or symptoms which may be manifestations of undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness include, but are not limited to: (1) fatigue, (2) unexplained rashes or other dermatological signs or symptoms, (3) headache, (4) muscle pain, (5) joint pain, (6) neurological signs and symptoms, (7) neuropsychological signs or symptoms, (8) signs or symptoms involving the upper or lower respiratory system, (9) sleep disturbances, (10) gastrointestinal signs or symptoms, (11) cardiovascular signs or symptoms, (12) abnormal weight loss, and (13) menstrual disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (b).

Under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), effective from August 10, 2022, Section 303 implemented 38 U.S.C. § 1168, requiring a disability examination and medical opinion be requested for certain non-presumptive conditions involving toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  For such claims, VA is required to provide a disability examination and medical opinion when the Veteran submits a claim for compensation, has evidence of a disability, had evidence of participation in a TERA, and such evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability.  A Veteran can claim participation in a TERA explicitly or implicitly through service in a location presumed associated with toxic exposure, or records showing participation in a TERA; or, if VA has conceded exposure in a prior claim, or the file has a claim attributable to toxic exposure. Other ways to claim or establish participation in a TERA include, when a Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) is associated with toxic exposure; when medical records suggest exposure to a toxic substance, chemical, or airborne hazard such as VHA exposure screening; or, with any other relevant evidence of record to include garrison exposures.

Pertinent to a claim for service connection, such a determination requires a finding of current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).  The requirement of a current disability is satisfied when the Veteran has a disability at the time he files his service connection claim or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  However, when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of the diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  Under applicable regulation, the term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see also Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292 (1991).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is granted. 

The Veteran alleges that he has right ear hearing loss as a result of his active-duty service.  Specifically, he contends that he suffered acoustic trauma in service which has caused his claimed hearing loss.

The Board notes that the threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels, and higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).  For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Court has held that service connection can be granted for a hearing loss where the Veteran can establish a nexus between his current hearing loss and a disability or injury he suffered while he was in military service.  Godfrey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 352, 356 (1992).  The Court has also held that VA regulations do not preclude service connection for a hearing loss which first met VA's definition of disability after service.  Hensley, supra, at 159.

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for complaints, treatment, or a definitive diagnosis related to right ear hearing loss.  However, while the Veteran's hearing was within normal limits at his service entrance, whisper test conducted upon enlistment was 15/15 bilaterally in March 1975, audiograms conducted throughout his service revealed hearing loss in his right ear.  In February 1979, audiological testing, revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels as follows:

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	6000

Right	15	5	0	25	45	25

Left	5	0	0	10	10	25

In August 1985, audiological testing, revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels as follows:

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	6000

Right	5	0	5	15	40	25

Left	10	0	0	15	35	45

In March 1989, audiological testing, revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels as follows:

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	6000

Right	10	10	0	25	40	30

Left	5	0	-5	20	35	45

Finally, during the examination conducted at his separation in January 1995, audiological testing, revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels as follows:

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	6000

Right	5	5	-5	25	35	30

Left	5	0	-5	20	35	35

While the Veteran's testing at separation did not show hearing loss for VA purposes, hearing impairment was evident at 4000 and 6000 Hz.  In addition, post service treatment records reflect the Veteran's reports of impaired hearing.

In December 2023 the Veteran underwent a VA Hearing Loss and Tinnitus examination with an accompanying disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ).  The examiner conducted an audiological examination, which revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

	500 Hz	1000 Hz	2000 Hz	3000 Hz	4000 Hz	6000 Hz	8000 Hz	Avg Hz

Right	15	15	20	75	75	80	80	46.25

Left	20	15	25	70	75	75	75	46.25

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 94 percent in both ears. The examiner found that the Veteran had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, that there was a permanent positive threshold shift greater than normal measurement variability at any frequency between 500 and 6000 Hz for both ears.  In addition, he opined that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss was at least as likely as not caused by or a result of an event in military service.  He provided the rationale that while the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) had low probability for hazardous noise exposure, as the Veteran's hearing had been within normal limits at his service entrance but abnormal at his discharge, it was more likely than not that his hearing loss was caused by or the result of military noise exposure. 

Throughout the appeal, the Veteran has submitted lay statements in support of his claims. The Veteran has continuously alleged that he suffers from bilateral hearing loss as a result of his service.

After a thorough review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection for right ear hearing loss is warranted as directly related to the Veteran's service. 

Initially, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current disability of right ear hearing loss for VA purposes.  In the present case, the Board notes that while the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for official complaints, treatment, and/or diagnosis of hearing loss for VA purposes, there is ample evidence to support that the Veteran not only has a current disability, but that such manifested during his service.  The Board notes that hearing impairment meeting the criteria for hearing loss was recorded throughout the Veteran's service records and abnormal hearing was documented during the Veteran's discharge examination.  In addition, the post-service December 2023 audiogram reflects that the Veteran was officially diagnosed with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and that his hearing loss was to such an extent recognized as a disability for VA purposes.  Therefore, a current disability has been established.

The Board further finds that the Veteran was exposed to noise during service.  In this regard, while the Veteran's Form DD-214 indicates that his MOS was storekeeper and that such had a low probability of hazardous noise exposure, the Veteran has alleged that he was exposed to hazardous noise through other aspects of his active service.  The Board finds the Veteran is competent to assert the occurrence of an in-service injury, to include in-service noise exposure.  See Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91 (1991).  Furthermore, the Board notes that the Veteran is service-connected for not only tinnitus but also left ear hearing loss as directly related to his service.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's in-service exposure to hazardous noise has been conceded. 

The remaining question is whether the Veteran's current right ear hearing loss is related to his in-service noise exposure.  The December 2023 VA examiner found that not only did the Veteran have bilateral hearing loss, but that such was incurred in service as a result of his hazardous noise exposure.  This opinion had clear conclusions and supporting data, as well as a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (a medical opinion that contains only data and conclusions is not entitled to any weight).  Furthermore, the Board notes that there are no contrary opinions of record. 

Given the evidence and the medical opinion of record, the Board concludes that the evidence is, at least, in relative equipoise on the nexus question.  Accordingly, further evidentiary development is not necessary.  Cf. Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003) (noting that, because it is not permissible for VA to undertake additional development to obtain evidence against an appellant's case, VA must provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its decision to pursue such development where such development could be reasonably construed as obtaining additional evidence for that purpose).

Furthermore, as previously noted, the Veteran has alleged that his hearing impairment was not only caused by acoustic trauma he experienced in service, but that it began during his active service.  Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1153 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support presence of disability even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence).

In conclusion, the evidence shows noise exposure in service, a current diagnosis of right ear hearing loss for VA purposes, and medical evidence showing a link between the Veteran's current hearing loss to his in-service noise exposure.  In sum, based on the analysis above, when resolving the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for right ear hearing loss is warranted.  The Board notes that, in reaching this conclusion, the evidence is at least in equipoise and the benefit of the doubt doctrine has been applied where appropriate.  Therefore, the Veteran's claim must be granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53.

Entitlement to service connection for left knee strain, lumbosacral strain (claimed as lumbar spine condition), right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, type II, and right elbow muscle pain associated with medial epicondylitis (claimed as right elbow condition), and urinary frequency associated with urinary urgency, to include as due to toxin exposure, are denied. 

The Veteran contends that he suffers from left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, type II, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency as a result of his service.  Specifically, the Veteran alleges that his disabilities either began during or were caused by his active service, to include his toxin exposure therein.  

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses of left knee, lumbosacral, right shoulder, right elbow, and/or urinary disabilities.  Furthermore, while the Veteran's records reflect a notation of urine sugar > 1000 in January 1995, there are also no complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus during the Veteran's service.  Furthermore, the Veteran's discharge examination in January 1995 was silent as to any complaints or diagnoses related to the Veteran's claimed disabilities. 

The Veteran's personnel records reflect that he served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, and his presumptive in-service exposure to environmental hazards has been conceded.  See December 2022, November 2023, and January 2024 Toxic Exposure Memoranda.  However, the Board notes that the January 2024 Memorandum also indicated that the Veteran had been exposed to contaminates, specifically benzene, at Camp LeJeune and cited the November 2023 Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER).  However, after a thorough review of the Veteran's personnel records as well as the November 2023 ILER, there is no evidence that the Veteran was ever stationed at Camp LeJeune, rather the Veteran's exposure to benzene was during his Persian Gulf service.  See November 2023 ILER.  Therefore, while the Veteran's in-service exposure to toxins has been conceded, such was the result of his service in Southwest 	Asia and does not include contaminated water at Camp LeJeune.  

Post-service treatment records reflect the Veteran's complaints of left knee, back, shoulder, and elbow pain, as well as polydipsia, nocturia, and urinary urgency. Furthermore, the Veteran was diagnosed with left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, type II, right elbow medial epicondylitis, and urinary frequency. 

In July 1995 the Veteran underwent a VA General Medical examination.  The Veteran reported that he had a history of duodenal ulcer and problems with pain between meals and at night.  In addition, the Veteran reported that at his retirement physical he was found to have high blood sugar and placed on a diabetic diet but was not prescribed medication.  The Veteran also reported right elbow pain with lifting, writing, and using a knife.  He also noted a cough, neck pain, eye condition, and headaches.  Upon examination, the Veteran's lymphatic, hemic, respiratory, endocrine, and genitourinary systems, head, face, neck, nose, sinuses, mouth, throat, and ears were normal.  The examiner reported that the Veteran had diagnoses to include status post vagotomy and antrectomy with possible residual post prandial symptoms of sweating and diarrhea, history of diabetes controlled with diet, history of right elbow pain, probably epicondylitis, history of exposure to industrial dust, now asymptomatic, and small asymptomatic left inguinal hernia.  The examiner did not provide any etiological opinions. 

In January 2003 the Veteran underwent an additional VA examination.  The examiner noted that a review of the Veteran's records reflected that a 1993 urinalysis showed a trace of glucose.  However, blood sugar levels in 1989 were normal at 108, but a 1995 fasting blood sugar was 138.  In addition, he noted that the Veteran had been treated for diabetes mellitus and in October 2002, he was prescribed glyburide. The Veteran stated that he did not check his blood sugar levels at home but did notice an increase in polydipsia, frequency, and nocturia. In addition, he reported occasional numbness in his leg and slight shortness of breath.  The examiner reported that the physical examination was normal and determined that the Veteran had diagnoses for: a history of chronic duodenal ulcer associated with subtotal gastrectomy, gastroduodenostomy Billroth I, and vagotomy; dumping syndrome secondary to chronic duodenal ulcer; borderline adult-onset diabetes mellitus, type II, non-insulin dependent type. The examiner did not provide any etiological opinions. 

In August 2018, the Veteran underwent a VA Diabetes Mellitus examination with an accompanying DBQ.  The examiner found that the Veteran had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II.  The examiner further found that the Veteran did not have any complications of diabetes mellitus or any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, symptoms, and/or scars.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II was less likely incurred in service.  The examiner provided the rationale that while the Veteran had laboratory findings of elevated blood sugar (hyperglycemia), he did not have a diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the examiner found that the Veteran's hyperglycemia, "is not, in and of itself, a disease or disability.  Hyperglycemia is just a laboratory finding." 

In January 2024 the Veteran underwent a VA Gulf War examination with an accompanying DBQ.  The examiner found that the Veteran did not have any diagnosed illnesses for which no etiology was established.  In addition, the examiner found no additional signs and/or symptoms that may represent an undiagnosed illness or diagnosed medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness.  The Veteran underwent several additional VA examinations, to include for Urinary Tract Conditions, Shoulder and Arm Conditions, Back Conditions, Knee and Lower Leg Conditions, Diabetes Mellitus, and Elbow and Forearm Conditions with accompanying DBQs.  

During the Urinary Tract Conditions examination, the examiner found that the Veteran had a diagnosis for urinary frequency.  The Veteran reported that his symptoms began in 1995 when he began needing to urinate every hour.  He stated that his symptoms, to include frequency and urgency, progressed over the years.  Upon examination, the examiner found that the Veteran had a voiding dysfunction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  The examiner found that the Veteran's urinary frequency was a diagnosable chronic multi-symptom illness with a partially explained etiology, and provided the rationale that "common symptoms of BPH include: frequent or urgent need to pee, also called urination. Peeing more often at night. Trouble starting to pee." The examiner opined that the Veteran's urinary frequency was less likely than not caused by the Veteran's indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA.  The examiner provided the rationale that as the medical evidence did not support a causal relationship between toxic exposure and urinary frequency, the Veteran's urinary frequency was most likely due to his BPH.

During the Shoulder and Arm Conditions examination, the examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of right shoulder strain and right rotator cuff tendinopathy.  The Veteran reported that he developed pain in the 1990s while "carrying boxes in delivery room, ship rocked, and [he] hit the wall many times."  He stated that his pain had progressed over the years.  Upon examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had limited range of motion in his right shoulder and exhibited pain with weight-bearing, active motion, and passive motion. However, the examiner found no evidence of muscle atrophy, ankylosis, instability, dislocation, labral pathology, clavicle, scapula, acromioclavicular (AC) joint, sternoclavicular joint conditions, conditions/impairments of the humerus, or any other pertinent physical findings, complications, signs, or symptoms. The examiner found that the Veteran's shoulder disability was a diagnosable chronic multi-symptom illness with a partially explained etiology and provided the rationale that there was no evidence that shoulder strain and/or tendinopathy were caused by or due to toxic exposure.  Rather, the examiner noted that the Veteran's records reflected that he developed shoulder pain after yard work, and that shoulder strain was caused by repetitive strain on the joint such as throwing, weightlifting, swimming, and motions required by certain occupations. 

During the Back Conditions examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had diagnoses for lumbosacral strain and left lower extremity radiculopathy.  The Veteran reported that he began to develop back pain in the 1980s-1990s following the "wear and tear" of his service.  He also reported that he occasionally experienced left leg tingling and numbness.  Upon examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had limited range of motion in his lumbar spine and exhibited pain in forward flexion, extension, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right lateral rotation, and left lateral rotation and with weight-bearing and in active motion.  However, the examiner found no evidence of muscle atrophy and reflex testing was normal.  Sensory testing was primarily normal, except for decreased sensation in the left lower leg/ankle and foot/toes.  In addition, left side straight leg raising was positive and the examiner noted left side radiculopathy, to include mild constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and moderate intermittent pain in the left lower extremity.  The examiner found no evidence of ankylosis, neurologic abnormalities/findings, intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS), or any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms.  The examiner found that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability was a diagnosable chronic multi-symptom illness with a partially explained etiology and provided the rationale that there was no medical evidence to suggest that lumbar strain was caused by toxic exposure.  He noted that lumbar strain was an injury to the low back which resulted in damaged tendons and muscles that can spasm and feel sore. 

During the Knee and Lower Leg Conditions examination, the examiner found that the Veteran had a diagnosis for left knee strain.  The Veteran reported that he injured his knee during his service in the 1990s, when he "hit [his] left knee while in the ship."  He stated that he still had left knee pain during exercising, walking, and climbing stairs.  Upon examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had limited range of motion in his left knee and exhibited pain in flexion and extension and with weight-bearing, and in active and passive motion.  However, the examiner found no evidence of muscle atrophy, ankylosis, recurrent subluxation, persistent instability, recurrent patellar instability, tibial or fibular impairment, meniscal conditions, or any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms.  The examiner found that the Veteran's left knee disability was a diagnosable chronic multi-symptom illness with a partially explained etiology and provided the rationale that knee strains were the result of injuries, extended work outs, and other physical activities and not the result of toxin exposure. 

During the Diabetes Mellitus examination, the examiner confirmed the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II diagnosis.  In addition, the examiner conducted a Diabetic Sensory-Motor Peripheral Neuropathy examination and found that the Veteran had bilateral lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which caused severe constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness in the Veteran's right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities, as well as mild constant pain and moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness in the left upper extremity. The examiner noted that the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy resulted in moderate incomplete paralysis of the bilateral radial, median, ulnar, sciatic, and femoral nerves.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's diabetes required prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents but not the regulation of activities. Upon examination, the examiner found no evidence of rashes or lesions, and inspection of the chest, lungs, and abdomen were normal with no evidence of tenderness on palpation.  The examiner found no evidence of edema and peripheral pulses were within normal limits. The neurological examination was abnormal with loss of sensation on the right side of the upper and lower extremities, loss of light touch to both feet, and loss of sensation on the right side of his face.  Finally, the examiner found that the Veteran had diabetic peripheral neuropathy, but no other complications to include erectile dysfunction, cardiac conditions, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, skin conditions, or eye conditions other than diabetic retinopathy, or any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran.  The examiner provided the rationale that the exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown, but that in all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin.  He noted that both types of diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, to include race and ethnicity.   

During the Elbow and Forearm Conditions examination, the examiner found that the Veteran had right side medial epicondylitis.  The Veteran reported that in 1977, he slipped and hit his right shoulder and elbow which resulted in pain and swelling.  Upon examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had limited range of motion in his right elbow and exhibited pain in flexion, extension, forearm supination and pronation, and with weight-bearing, non-weight bearing, in active and passive motion, and on rest/non-movement.  However, the examiner found no evidence of muscle atrophy, ankylosis, flail joint, joint fracture, nonunion of radius and ulna, impairment of ulna, impairment of radius, impairment of supination and pronation, or any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, and/or symptoms.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's right elbow disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner provided the rationale that the Veteran's current diagnosis was medial epicondylitis, and that while the Veteran claimed that he suffered a blunt trauma in service, such was not the usual mechanism of injury/cause of medial epicondylitis.  Rather such was the result of damage to the muscles and tendons that controlled the wrist and fingers, and that such damage was generally caused by excessive or repeated stress, especially forceful wrist and finger motions.  In addition, the examiner found that any sequelae from the Veteran's claimed in-service injury, to include any contusions, would have resolved within weeks.  Furthermore, the examiner noted that the Veteran's service records were silent for any complaints of elbow pain.  

In March 2024, additional Medical Opinions were obtained in regard to the Veteran's right shoulder, lumbar spine, and left knee disabilities.  In regard to the Veteran's right shoulder, the examiner opined that the Veteran's disabilities were less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner provided the rationale that after a thorough review of the Veteran's medical records, there was no documentation indicating that the Veteran complained of or was treated for shoulder pain during his active service, to include as in response to his alleged injury.  

In regard to the Veteran's lumbar spine, the examiner opined that the Veteran's disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner provided the rationale that after considering the duties, activities, and experiences unique to military service, the onset of the symptoms relative to service, pertinent positive and negative history, weighing all of the evidence as well as injuries/activities and risk factors post service that contributed to the Veteran's condition, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability was not a direct result of his service and a nexus to service could not be provided.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's entrance and separation examinations were silent for any back complaints or diagnoses, and his service treatment records were also devoid of any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses of back conditions.  Finally, the examiner found no evidence to suggest that the Veteran's back disability was not the result of causes outside of military service.  

In regard to the Veteran's left knee, the examiner opined that the Veteran's disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner noted that while the Veteran reported that he injured his knees in service, "walking on the ship's ladder up and down, from storeroom to storeroom carrying boxes and parts, and hitting [his] knees on the ladders," the examiner was unable to find any medical records to support the Veteran's allegations.  He found that after a thorough review of the medical evidence of record, there was no support for a direct pathophysiological connection, as the Veteran's service records lacked any complaints/treatment for left knee disabilities, to include strain. The examiner noted that the Veteran's separation examination was silent for any knee related complaints or concerns. 

Throughout the appeal, the Veteran has submitted lay statements in support of his claims.  The Veteran has continuously alleged that he suffers from left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, type II, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency as a result of his service.  Specifically, he contends that in regard to his musculoskeletal disabilities, to include his shoulder, back, elbow, and knee that such were the result of in-service injuries. In addition, in regard to his diabetes and urinary frequency, he alleges that such were caused by his in-service toxin exposures.   

After a thorough review of the record, the Board finds that service connection for left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, type II, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency is not warranted on any basis to include presumptive or direct service connection.

As an initial matter, the Board finds the evidence clearly shows the Veteran has symptoms related to and current diagnoses for left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, type II, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency, but as previously noted there were no reports of any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to such in service.  However, the first element of service connection either presumptive or direct has been met.

In regard to presumptive service connection and service connection based on continuity of symptomatology, the Board notes that left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency are not listed as chronic diseases under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309.  Furthermore, while diabetes mellitus is considered a chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309, there is no evidence that the Veteran's diabetes manifested to a compensable degree within one year of his service discharge.  Rather the first documentation of diabetes mellitus was not until 2002, approximately seven years after his discharge from service.  Therefore, presumptive service connection and service connection based on continuity of symptomatology is not warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

In regard to direct service connection, the Board again notes that the Veteran's left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency were not diagnosed during his military service.  As was noted above, the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses for left knee, lumbosacral, or right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, right elbow pain, and/or urinary frequency or any incident or injury related to such.  As there is no credible evidence that the Veteran was diagnosed with or exhibited symptoms of his claimed disabilities during his military service, no examination or opinion is necessary to decide such aspect of his claims.  See Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36 (2010) (holding that VA is not required to provide a medical examination when there is not credible evidence of an event, injury, or disease in service).  However, as the Veteran was exposed to environmental hazards during his service and as he alleged in-service unreported injuries, he was provided with VA examinations in July 1995, January 2003, August 2018, and January 2024, as well as medical opinions in January and March 2024.  

The VA examiners all found that the Veteran's disabilities to include left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency were less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event or illness or were otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty service.  The examiners found that the Veteran's service treatment records, to include his entrance and separation examinations, were silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to his claimed disabilities.  Furthermore, in regard to his alleged in-service unreported injuries, the January 2024 VA examiners specifically found that any sequelae from the described "blunt trauma" had resolved and were not the usual "mechanism" or cause associated with the Veteran's current disabilities.  Furthermore, in regard to the relationship, if any, between the Veteran's in-service TERA, and his current disabilities, the VA examiners found that while the Veteran participated in TERA, specifically hazardous exposures in Southwest Asia, they had no relationship to his current disabilities. The examiners stated that there was no medical evidence to support causal relationships between the Veteran's presumed exposures and his current disabilities.  As the VA examiners provided sound medical explanations and rationales for their opinions, the Board finds them highly probative.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 295; Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).  In addition, there are no contrary opinions of record. 

Furthermore, in regard to the Veteran's service in the Persian Gulf, the January 2024 VA Gulf War examiner specifically found that the Veteran did not have any diagnosed illnesses for which no etiology was established.  In addition, the examiner found no additional signs and/or symptoms that may represent an undiagnosed illness or diagnosed medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness.  Finally, while the additional January 2024 VA examiners found that the Veteran's various conditions constituted diagnosable chronic multi-symptom illnesses with partially explained etiologies, the Board notes that under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (a)(2)(ii), chronic multisymptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology are not considered medically unexplained and therefore not subject to service connection as such. 

Finally, the contemporary medical evidence does not support a finding that the Veteran's conditions began in service or supports chronicity of such symptoms. The Veteran's post-service medical records are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses of left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, right elbow muscle pain, and/or urinary frequency until 2002.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's allegation that his disabilities began in or are the result of his service.  However, he is not competent to diagnose or speak to the etiology of complex medication conditions.  As fundamental elements of direct service connection are missing, the Board finds that direct service connection is not warranted for the Veteran's claims for left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency.

The Board has also considered the Veteran's statements that his left knee, lumbar spine, right shoulder, diabetes, right elbow, and urinary disabilities are related to his service.  In this regard, a layperson is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994).  A lay person may speak to etiology in some limited circumstances in which nexus is obvious merely through observation, such as a fall leading to a broken leg.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77.

However, the question of causation or aggravation of left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency disabilities involves medical subjects concerning internal physical processes extending beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship.  In this regard, such opinions require specialized knowledge of several internal bodily systems.  There is no indication that the Veteran possesses such specialized knowledge.  As such, the question of etiology in this case may not be competently addressed by lay evidence, and the Veteran's opinions regarding the etiology of his left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency disabilities are non-probative evidence.  See Jandreau, supra; Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007).  Moreover, the Veteran has offered only conclusory statements regarding the relationship between his claimed disabilities and his service.  In contrast, the VA examiners took into consideration all the relevant facts in providing opinions.  Therefore, the Board accords great probative weight to the VA examiners' opinions.

Consequently, the Board finds that the Veteran's left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency disabilities are not shown to be causally or etiologically related to a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during active service, to include his toxin exposure therein.  Therefore, service connection for such claimed disabilities is not warranted.

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, the evidence of record is against the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for left knee strain, lumbosacral strain, right shoulder strain, diabetes mellitus, right elbow muscle pain, and urinary frequency disabilities.  As such, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his claims must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, supra.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral upper extremity and lower extremity neuropathy, to include impairment of the radial nerve, sciatic nerve, anterior crural nerve, external cutaneous nerve, ilio-inguinal nerve, and obturator nerve, to include as due to toxin exposure, or as secondary to lumbosacral strain and/or diabetes mellitus, are denied.   

The Veteran contends that he suffers from bilateral upper and lower extremity neuropathy as a result of his service.  Specifically, the Veteran alleges that his disabilities were caused by his active service, to include his toxin exposure therein or in the alternative that such were caused or aggravated by his lumbar spine disability and/or diabetes mellitus.  

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses of upper and/or lower extremity neuropathy.  However, the Veteran's personnel records reflect that he served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, and his presumptive in-service exposure to environmental hazards has been conceded.  See December 2022, November 2023, and January 2024 Toxic Exposure Memoranda.  Post-service treatment records reflect the Veteran's complaints of upper and lower extremity numbness and pain. 

In July 1995 and January 2003, the Veteran underwent VA examinations.  The examiners noted the Veteran's reports of a history of diabetes controlled with diet. The January 2003 examiner noted that the Veteran had been treated for diabetes mellitus in October 2002 and prescribed glyburide. The Veteran stated that he did not check his blood sugar levels at home but did notice an increase in polydipsia, frequency, and nocturia.  In addition, he reported occasional numbness in his leg.  The examiners noted that the physical examinations were normal. Finally, while the July 1995 examiner found that the Veteran had a "history of diabetes controlled with diet" and the January 2003 found the Veteran had "borderline adult-onset diabetes mellitus, type II, non-insulin dependent type," neither examiner diagnosed any diabetic complications nor noted any neuropathy. 

In August 2018, the Veteran underwent a VA Diabetes Mellitus examination with an accompanying DBQ.  The examiner found that the Veteran had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II, but no complications of diabetes mellitus, to include diabetic neuropathy, or any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, symptoms, and/or scars.  

In January 2024 the Veteran underwent a VA Peripheral Nerves Conditions examination with an accompanying DBQ.  The examiner found that the Veteran did not have a peripheral nerve condition or peripheral neuropathy.  The Veteran reported that he began to experience pain in his right arm and left leg in the 1980s-1990s, and that his symptoms had progressed over the years.  While the examiner found the Veteran did not have diagnoses for peripheral neuropathy or peripheral nerve conditions, he did note related symptoms to include mild constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness as well as moderate intermittent pain in the left lower extremity.  Muscle strength and reflex testing were normal and there was no evidence of muscle atrophy.  Sensory testing was predominantly normal, except for decreased sensation in the left foot/toes.  The examiner found no evidence of trophic changes and the Veteran's gait was normal.  The examiner found the Veteran's upper extremity nerves, to include bilateral radial, median, ulnar, musculocutaneous, circumflex, long thoracic, middle radicular group, and lower radicular group, were all normal with no paralysis. Furthermore, of the Veteran's lower extremity nerves, the examiner found only mild incomplete paralysis of the left side sciatic nerve, with no paralysis of the right side sciatic, or bilateral external popliteal, musculocutaneous, anterior tibial, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, anterior crural, internal saphenous, obturator, external cutaneous of the thigh, and illio-inguinal nerves.    The examiner found that the abnormalities found upon examination were due to the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy related to his back condition.  Finally, the examiner found that the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy was a diagnosable chronic multi-symptom illness with a partially explained etiology.  He noted that radiculopathy was caused by compression or irritation of the nerves as they exit the spine which could be due to strain, bone spur, osteoarthritis, or thickening of the ligaments.  The examiner further opined that the Veteran's claimed bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran. In regard to the Veteran's claimed bilateral upper extremity peripheral neuropathy and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, the examiner provided the rationale that there was no objective evidence of the claimed conditions and therefore no diagnoses. In regard to the Veteran's claimed left lower extremity neuropathy, the examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with left lower extremity radiculopathy related to his lumbar strain, and that there was no medical evidence to suggest that lumbar strains were caused by toxin exposure. 

In January 2024 the Veteran also underwent a VA Back Conditions examination with an accompanying DBQ.  The examiner found that the Veteran had lumbosacral strain and left lower extremity radiculopathy. The Veteran reported that he occasionally experienced left leg tingling and numbness.  Sensory testing was primarily normal, except for decreased sensation in the left lower leg/ankle and foot/toes. In addition, left side straight leg raising was positive and the examiner noted left side radiculopathy, to include mild constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and moderate intermittent pain in the left lower extremity.  

In January 2024 the Veteran underwent VA Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetic Sensory-Motor Peripheral Neuropathy examinations with accompanying DBQs.   The examiner found that the Veteran had diabetes mellitus, type II, which was diagnosed in August 2002, and bilateral lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy caused severe constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness in the Veteran's right upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities, as well as mild constant pain and moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness in the left upper extremity. The examiner noted that the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy resulted in moderate incomplete paralysis of the bilateral radial, median, ulnar, sciatic, and femoral nerves. The neurological examination was abnormal with loss of sensation on the right side of the upper and lower extremities, loss of light touch to both feet, and loss of sensation on the right side of the Veteran's face.  While the examiner did not provide an etiological opinion in regard to the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy, he did find that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus was less likely than not caused by the Veteran's in-service toxin exposure.  The examiner provided the rationale that the exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown, but that a combination of genetic and environmental factors greatly increased an individual's likelihood for developing diabetes.  He noted that the Veteran had certain risk factors, to include race and ethnicity, which put him at higher risk.  

Throughout the appeal, the Veteran has submitted lay statements in support of his claims.  The Veteran has continuously alleged that he suffers from bilateral upper and lower extremity neuropathy as a result of his service or in the alternative that such were caused or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities. 

After a thorough review of the record, the Board finds that service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is not warranted on any basis to include presumptive, direct, or secondary service connection.

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Veteran has diagnoses for bilateral upper and lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  See January 2024 VA Diabetic Sensory-Motor Peripheral Neuropathy examinations.  Therefore, the first element of service connection, either presumptive, direct, or secondary has been met. 

In regard to presumptive service connection and service connection based on continuity of symptomatology, the Board notes that diabetic peripheral neuropathy is not listed as a chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309.  Therefore, presumptive service connection and service connection based on continuity of symptomatology is not warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

In regard to direct service connection, the Board again notes that the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy was not diagnosed during his military service.  As was noted above, the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses for upper and/or lower extremity peripheral neuropathy or any incident or injury related to such.  As there is no credible evidence that the Veteran was diagnosed with or exhibited symptoms of upper and/or lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy during his military service, no examination or opinion is necessary to decide such aspect of his claims.  See Bardwell, 24 Vet. App. at 36.  However, as the Veteran was exposed to environmental hazards during his service, he was provided with VA examinations in January 2024 with TERA medical opinions. 

The January 2024 VA examiners found that the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy were less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran.  The Peripheral Nerves examiner found that the Veteran's claimed conditions were not only not caused by his in-service exposures, but that there was no objective evidence of bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy and therefore no chronic diagnoses.  In addition, while the Diabetic Sensory examiner found that the Veteran did have bilateral upper and lower extremity neuropathy, he found that such was diabetic in nature.  As the VA examiners provided sound medical explanations and rationales for their opinions, the Board finds them highly probative.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 295; Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124.  Furthermore, there are no contrary opinions of record. 

Finally, the Board notes that the contemporary medical evidence does not support a finding that the Veteran's conditions began in service or supports chronicity of such symptoms.  The Veteran's post-service medical record is negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for diabetic peripheral neuropathy until 2024.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's allegation that his disabilities began in or are the result of his service.  However, he is not competent to diagnose or speak to the etiology of complex medication conditions.  As fundamental elements of direct service connection are missing, the Board finds that direct service connection is not warranted for the Veteran's claims for bilateral upper and lower extremity disabilities.

As for secondary service connection, the Board notes that the Veteran is not currently service connected for lumbosacral strain or diabetes mellitus.  As such, the Board finds that under the law, the Veteran lacks legal grounds to establish entitlement to service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy on a secondary basis.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).  In Sabonis, the Court held that in cases in which the law and not the evidence is dispositive, a claim for entitlement to VA benefits should be denied or the appeal to the Board terminated because of the absence of legal merit or the lack of entitlement under the law.  Insofar as service connection is not in effect for the disability/disabilities claimed by the Veteran to have proximally caused his bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, service connection on a secondary basis is not applicable under the law.

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements that his peripheral neuropathy is related to his service and/or his lumbar spine and/or diabetes.  In this regard, a layperson is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge.  See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469.  A lay person may speak to etiology in some limited circumstances in which nexus is obvious merely through observation, such as a fall leading to a broken leg.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77.  However, the question of causation or aggravation of peripheral neuropathy involves a medical subject concerning an internal physical process extending beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship.  In this regard, such an opinion requires specialized knowledge of several internal bodily systems.  There is no indication that the Veteran possesses such specialized knowledge.  As such, the question of etiology in this case may not be competently addressed by lay evidence, and the Veteran's opinion regarding the etiology of his peripheral neuropathy is non-probative evidence.  See Jandreau, supra; Woehlaert, 21 Vet. App. at 456.  Moreover, the Veteran has offered only conclusory statements regarding the relationship between his peripheral neuropathy and his service and/or his lumbar spine disability and diabetes.  In contrast, the VA examiners took into consideration all the relevant facts in providing their opinions.  Therefore, the Board accords greater probative weight to the VA examiners' opinions and medical evidence of record.

The Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy is not shown to be causally or etiologically related to any disease, injury, or incident during service, to include any toxin exposure, did not manifest within one year of service discharge, and is not caused or aggravated by any of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities.  Therefore, service connection for such disabilities is not warranted.

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence of record is against the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his claims must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, supra.

Entitlement to service connection for a vestibular disability, to include vertigo, is denied.

The Veteran contends that he suffers from vertigo as a result of his service. 

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to vertigo or any vestibular disorder.  During the Veteran's January 1995 separation examination, he denied dizziness, fainting spells, and ear trouble.  While post-service treatment records reflect the Veteran's reports of vertigo symptoms, they are silent for any treatment or definitive diagnoses related to a vestibular disorder, to include vertigo. 

Here, while the Veteran has reported symptoms which he believes began in or were caused by his service, the evidence of record does not support the Veteran's claims. There are simply no indications of any symptoms or diagnoses related to a chronic disability, to include vertigo either during or after the Veteran's active service. Consequently, the Board finds that VA is under no obligation to provide the Veteran with an examination in connection with his claim.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  Despite the lack of obligation, as the Veteran was exposed to environmental hazards during his service, he was provided with an examination in March 2024. 

In March 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA Ear Conditions examination with an accompanying DBQ.  The examiner found that the Veteran did not have, nor had he ever been diagnosed with an ear or peripheral vestibular condition, to include vertigo.  The Veteran reported that he believed that he developed vertigo symptoms during his service, and that he continued to have dizziness and room spinning episodes.  The examiner specifically found that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of vertigo, as there were no signs or symptoms of such upon examination.  The examiner also provided the opinion that the Veteran's claimed vertigo was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness as the examiner found there was no pathology to warrant a diagnosis. 

Throughout the appeal, the Veteran has submitted lay statements in support of his claims.  Alleging not only that he suffers from chronic disabilities, to include vertigo, but that such were caused by or began during his active service.

After a thorough review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a confirmed diagnosis of vertigo.  Therefore, service connection is not warranted for the Veteran's claimed vertigo as the probative evidence of record fails to demonstrate a current disability related to the Veteran's military service.

In the instant case, the probative evidence of record fails to demonstrate a current diagnosis of a chronic vestibular disability, to include vertigo.  While the Board has also considered the Court's holding in Romanowsky, supra, there is also no probative evidence of a recent diagnosis of the claimed disability prior to the Veteran's claim.  The Veteran's service treatment records and post-service treatment records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a chronic vestibular disability, to include vertigo. 

In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report his own symptoms or matters within his personal knowledge.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1372; Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1331.  In addition, laypersons may, in some circumstances, opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (the Board's categorical statement that 'a valid medical opinion' was required to establish nexus, and that a layperson was 'not competent' to provide testimony as to nexus because she was a layperson, conflicts with Jandreau).

However, the matter of a medical diagnosis for a disability not capable of lay observation, such as that of issue here, is a matter within the province of trained medical professionals.  See Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137-38 (1994).  Specifically, the diagnosis of a vestibular disability, to include vertigo, involves medical subjects concerning internal physical processes extending beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship and require the administration and interpretation of specialized testing.  In the instant case, there is no suggestion that the Veteran has had any medical training.  Therefore, as the Veteran does not have the appropriate medical training and expertise to competently self-diagnose a vestibular disability, to include vertigo, the lay assertions in this regard have no probative value.  Jandreau, supra at 1377 n.4 ("[s]ometimes the layperson will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer"); see also Woehlaert, 21 Vet. App. at 456 (although the claimant is competent in certain situations to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition such as a broken leg or varicose veins, the claimant is not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions).

The Board emphasizes that Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service connection for disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in disability.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.30, 3.310.  Thus, where, as here, the probative evidence indicates that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a vestibular disability, to include vertigo, for the entire appeal period, there can be no valid claim for service connection.  See Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer, supra.

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a vestibular disability, to include vertigo, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53.

Increased Rating Claim 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where the appeal arises from the original assignment of a disability evaluation following an award of service connection, the severity of the disability at issue is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  While the Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making a disability determination, where service connection has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is a present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  The Court has held that, in determining the present level of a disability for any increased evaluation claim, the Board must consider the application of staged ratings.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  In other words, where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibited diverse symptoms meeting the criteria for different ratings during the course of the appeal, the assignment of staged ratings would be necessary.

Consideration is given to the potential application of the various provisions of 38 C.F.R. Parts 3 and 4, whether or not they are raised by the Veteran, as required by Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  All benefit of the doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In view of the number of atypical instances it is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified.  Findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom, and above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will, however, are expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  Pyramiding, the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when rating a Veteran's service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  It is possible for a Veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury which would permit rating under several diagnostic codes, however, the critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

The basis of disability evaluation is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected left ear hearing loss is denied. 

The Veteran contends that the severity of his left ear hearing loss warrants a higher rating than that currently assigned.  As the Veteran filed his claim for a compensable rating in response to the RO's initial grant of service connection for left ear hearing loss, the entire appeal period is for consideration.

The Veteran's left ear hearing loss has been evaluated as noncompensable effective November 15, 2023.  The Rating Schedule provides a table for ratings purposes (Table VI) to determine a Roman numeral designation (I through XI) for hearing impairment, established by a state-licensed audiologist including a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC), and based upon a combination of the percent of speech discrimination and the pure tone threshold average which is the sum of the pure tone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hertz, divided by four.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

Table VII is used to determine the percentage evaluation by combining the Roman numeral designations for hearing impairment of each ear.  The horizontal row represents the ear having the poorer hearing and the vertical column represents the ear having the better hearing.  Id. 

Table VIA is used when the examiner certifies that the use of speech discrimination test is not appropriate because of language difficulties, inconsistent speech discrimination scores, etc., or when indicated under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.86. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(c).

When the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Each ear will be evaluated separately.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86 (a).

When the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  That numeral will then be elevated to the next higher Roman numeral.  Each ear will be evaluated separately.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86 (b).

To evaluate the degree of disability from defective hearing, the rating schedule establishes eleven auditory acuity levels designated from I for essentially normal acuity, through XI for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI, VII.

Pertinent case law provides that the assignment of disability ratings for hearing impairment are to be derived by the mechanical application of the Ratings Schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometry evaluations are rendered.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

Post-service treatment records reflect the Veteran's reports of impaired hearing.  He was afforded a VA examination in December 2023 and audiometric testing revealed the following:

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	6000	8000	Avg. 

Left	20	15	25	70	75	75	75	46.25

Right	15	15	20	75	75	80	80	46.25

The pure tone threshold average was 46.25 and speech recognition was 94 percent in both ears.  The examiner reviewed the claims file and found that the Veteran had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.

Throughout the appeal, the Veteran has submitted statements in which he has indicated his belief that his hearing loss warrants a rating higher than that which has been assigned.  However, the Veteran has not made any specific allegations or contentions.

At the time of the December 2023 audiological examination, the Veteran was shown to have an average pure tone hearing loss of 46.25 and speech discrimination of 94 percent in both ears, which translates to a Roman numeral designation of I in both ears.  Thus, when applying Table VII, Diagnostic Code 6100, level I in both ears, equates to a noncompensable disability evaluation.

Based on the average pure tone threshold findings from the VA examination, when applying Table VII, Diagnostic Code 6100, the findings equate to a noncompensable disability evaluation.  While documenting hearing loss, VA clinical records during this period do not address the severity of the Veteran's hearing loss for rating purposes.  There is simply no evidence to show that the Veteran met the rating criteria for a compensable rating.

Therefore, as the evidence of record is against the Veteran's allegations that his left ear hearing loss is worse than reflected, the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for service-connected left ear hearing loss is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53.

Other Considerations

In assessing the severity of the disability under consideration, the Board has considered the Veteran's assertions as to the type and frequency and/or severity of his symptoms, which he is certainly competent to provide.  See, e.g., Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 470.  Additionally, the Board notes that the Veteran is credible in his reports of his symptomatology, as he has been consistent in his reports to treatment providers, and his statements were not challenged by his treatment providers.  However, the criteria needed to support a higher rating requires medical findings that are within the province of trained medical professionals.  See Jones, 7 Vet. App. at 137-38.  As such, the lay assertions are not considered more persuasive than the objective medical findings which, as indicated above, do not support assignment of a compensable rating.

The Board has considered whether staged ratings under Hart, supra, are appropriate for the Veteran's left ear hearing loss; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology has been stable for such disability throughout the appeal.  Therefore, assigning staged ratings for the disability is not warranted.

Ultimately, the Board finds that the evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim and a compensable rating is not warranted.  Therefore, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable, and the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Although the Board regrets the delay, a remand is necessary to ensure that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's remaining claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

The Board finds that the issue of entitlement to service connection for IGH must be remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.

VA's duty to assist includes a duty to provide a medical examination or obtain a medical opinion where it is deemed necessary to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4); Duenas v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 512 (2004); Robinette v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 69 (1995); McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 79.  In addition, once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service connection claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide an adequate one or, at a minimum, notify the claimant why one will not or cannot be provided.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).  For below noted reasons, the Board finds that an addendum VA opinion is needed to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed IGH.

Entitlement to service connection for IGH (claimed as skin conditions), to include as due to toxin exposure, is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he suffers from IGH as a result of his active-duty service, to include toxin exposure therein. 

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of IGH or any other related skin conditions.  However, the Veteran was diagnosed post-service with IGH.  Furthermore, the Board notes that TERA Memoranda in December 2022, January 2023, and January 2024 confirmed that the Veteran had active service in Southwest Asia and conceded in-service toxin exposure.  

In January 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA Skin Diseases examination with an accompanying DBQ.  The examiner found that the Veteran was diagnosed with IGH.  The Veteran reported that in 1995, he developed small white spots on his forearms.  Upon examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran's skin condition had not been treated with medication within the prior 12 months.  But he noted that the Veteran's IGH impacted 5 to 20 percent of the Veteran's total body area, but none of his exposed area. The examiner found no evidence of acne, chloracne, vitiligo, scarring alopecia, alopecia areata, hyperhidrosis, chronic urticaria, primary cutaneous vasculitis, erythroderma, toxic epidermal necrolysis erythema multiforme, tumors, neoplasms, scarring, disfigurement, or any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, and/or symptoms.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's skin condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner provided the rationale that the Veteran's medical records were silent for a skin condition during service, to include any treatment or diagnosis, and therefore he could not provide a nexus to service. 

Unfortunately, the Board notes that while TERA opinions were obtained for several of the Veteran's claimed disabilities, there does not appear to be a TERA opinion for the Veteran's claimed IGH.  Therefore, the Board finds that in order to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error, the Veteran must be provided with a TERA opinion in regard to his skin condition.  See Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 311.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Provide the claims file, to include a copy of this remand, to the January 2024 VA examiner, or another appropriate medical professional for an addendum etiological opinion in regard to the Veteran's IGH.  The need for another examination is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the addendum opinion. The claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to, and reviewed by the examiner.  Such review must be noted.

The examiner is asked to furnish opinions with respect to the following:

A)	Whether the Veteran's IGH at least as likely as not began during or as a result of the Veteran's active service?

B)	 Whether the Veteran's IGH manifested within one year of the Veteran's discharge from service?

C)	Whether the Veteran's IGH was noted during his service with continuity of the same symptomatology since service?

D)	Whether the Veteran's IGH is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or illness, to specifically include toxin exposure in service as noted on the December 2022, November 2023, and January 2023 TERA Memoranda.  

A COMPLETE rationale MUST be provided for all opinions offered, and a restatement of the facts of the case is not a sufficient rationale.  If it is not possible to provide a specific opinion regarding the above questions, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
