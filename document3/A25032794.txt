ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for migraine headaches is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran did not experience migraine headaches with very frequent, completely prostrating, and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for migraine headaches have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 3.400, 4.1-4.14, 4.121, 4.122, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2011 to April 2017 and from January 2018 to June 2023.???? 

An April 2024 rating?decision established service connection for migraine headaches, and assigned a 0 percent rating, effective November 28, 2023.? In April 2024, the Veteran requested a direct review of the appeal by the Board.? This case comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the April 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)?Veterans Benefits Administration Regional Office (RO), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

The current appeal stems from the Veteran's selection of direct review, in which the Veteran acknowledged that the review will be based on the evidence submitted to VA at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue on appeal.  Therefore, only evidence of record as of the date of the April 2024 rating?decision will be considered.

A July 2024 rating decision increased the  rating for migraine headaches from 0 percent to 30 percent, effective November 28, 2023.  A claimant will generally be presumed to be seeking the maximum benefits allowed by law and regulations, and it follows that a claim remains in controversy where less than the maximum available benefit is awarded, or until the Veteran withdraws the claim.  AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993).  Thus, the issue of entitlement to a higher rating for a migraine headache disability remains on appeal.

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for migraine headaches.

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during service and the residual conditions in civil occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (a), 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The migraine headache disability has been rated pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8100 which provides ratings for migraine headaches.  Diagnostic Code 8100 provides a 10 percent rating for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring an average of once every two months over the several months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months.  A maximum 50 percent rating is warranted for very frequent completely prostrating attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

There are several terms within Diagnostic Code 8100 that are not defined in the regulation itself but have been previously analyzed and defined by the Court. Prostrating means lacking in vitality or will, powerless to rise, or laid low.  Thus, because Diagnostic Code 8100 specifically governs migraine headaches, the phrase characteristic prostrating attacks plainly describes migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality.  The modifier completely, as used before prostrating in the 50 percent criteria, meant that the Veteran must be made entirely powerless and productive of severe economic inadaptability means either producing or capable of producing severe economic inadaptability.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018); Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440 (2004). 

In rating headaches or migraines under Diagnostic Code 8100, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).

The current claim on appeal stems from an initial grant of service connection for migraine headaches. Therefore, the period currently on appeal is November 28, 2023, the date service connection was established for migraines, to April 15, 2024, the date of the rating decision on appeal.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased rating for a service-connected migraine headaches disability, currently rated 30 percent disabling, effective November 28, 2023, pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8100.

In a November 2023 statement, the Veteran noted experiencing tension headaches about once a year as the Veteran's stress levels became worse, over the last year.  It eventually progressed to twice a week.  In the last 3 months, the Veteran reported having three to four tension headaches a week.  The Veteran noted that his job required him to stare at a computer screen daily, which he found impossible to do when headaches occurred. 

In a separate November 2023 statement, the Veteran reiterated having three to four tension headaches a week.  The Veteran described tension in the shoulders, and headaches that spread to the base of the neck, around the base of the skull and up behind the ears.  The Veteran noted that his job required looking at a computer screen for long periods of time, but that he needed to go to a dark room and close his eyes when the headaches started.  The migraines usually lasted between an hour and a half to four hours, but sometimes carried over into the next day.  The Veteran also reported lightheadedness after an episode, and brain fog. 

At an April 2024 VA headache examination, the Veteran reported experiencing bandlike stabbing pain headaches starting at the back of the head to the base of the skull lasting 45 minutes to 2 hours, occurring 3 to 5 times per week.  The headaches impacted the ability to concentrate and focus and were treated with over-the-counter medications.  On examination, the Veteran was found to have headache pain, described as tightness around the back of the neck and top, resulting in sensitivity to light and sound, typically lasting less than one day, on both sides of the head.  The Veteran was not found to have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine and non-migraine headache.  During the examination, the Veteran's condition was found to impact the Veteran's ability to concentrate and focus during headaches. 

The Board finds that the service-connected headaches did not warrant a rating in excess of 30 percent.  The Board finds that the symptoms the Veteran experienced do not more nearly approximate those described under the criteria for a 50 percent rating.  While the evidence shows that the Veteran had frequent headaches, the weight of the evidence does not show that the frequent headaches were productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Additionally, during the appeal period, no examiner found the Veteran to have very frequent prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.  All indications are that the Veteran experienced migraine headaches, but was able to manage them, as he continued employment.  Any interference with employment was shown to be less than severe economic inadaptability.  The Board recognizes that the ameliorative effects of medication are not to be considered.  However, even in the absence of medication, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding that there was severe economic inadaptability as a result of very frequent prostrating prolonged attacks of migraine pain.  After considering the evidence, the Board finds that the migraine symptoms did not render the Veteran entirely powerless but rather caused some difficulty in concentration and focus.  Therefore, the Board finds that a disability rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted for migraine headaches.

The Board acknowledges that while the Veteran may believe the symptoms are more severe than contemplated by the currently assigned disability rating, he does not possess the medical expertise to make such an assessment.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  While the Board recognizes that the Veteran is competent to describe symptomatology and resulting functional impairment, the Veteran is not competent to provide an opinion regarding the severity of symptoms in accordance with the rating criteria. Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007).  The Veteran's lay assertions are not considered more persuasive than the medical findings which, as indicated above, do not support the assignment of a higher rating for the migraine headaches. The Board finds the medical evidence in which professionals with specialized expertise examined the Veteran, acknowledged the reported symptoms, and described the manifestations of such disabilities in light of the rating criteria to be more persuasive than the Veteran's own reports regarding the severity of his disability.

The Board is appreciative of the Veteran's faithful and honorable service.  However, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates an initial rating of 30 percent for migraine headaches, and not higher, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.  The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the assignment of any higher rating.  As the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the assignment of any higher ratings, the claim for any higher rating must be denied.  The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
