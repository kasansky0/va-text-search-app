DOCKET NO. 230410-341874
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to whether the Veteran partially used educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 of Title 10 of the United States Code (Chapter 1606), also known as the Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR), from August 28, 1995 to November 18, 1995, is DISMISSED. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a March 2023 Certificate of Eligibility (COE), the Veteran was granted educational assistance benefits under the MGIB-SR, effective July 31, 2014.  The decision also notified the Veteran that her entitlement was for less than 36 months since she previously used a portion of her benefits from August 28, 1995 to November 18, 1995.  

2. After the filing of the Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA Form 10182) in April 2023, and following certification to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) by the VA Regional Office (RO), in April 2023, the RO overrode the March 2023 COE by notifying the Veteran that the decision was issued in error and should be disregarded as the Veteran's eligibility to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 was terminated effective October 11, 1997, according to records from the Department of Defense (DoD).  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to whether the Veteran partially used educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 from August 28, 1995 to November 18, 1995, have been met.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 1987 to July 1992, and from March to May 1993.  The Veteran had additional periods of active duty for training with the United States Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. 

The case is on appeal to the Board from a March 2023 RO decision that granted the Veteran educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 but also subtracted the months and days previously used by the Veteran from August 28, 1995 to November 18, 1995,  under the same educational assistance program.   

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.      

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

In January and March 2023, the Veteran applied for VA benefits (VA Form 22-1990) under the MGIB-SR to pursue a program of education at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. 

According to the Veteran's April 2023 VA Form 10182 and a subsequent April 2023 RO decision, in a March 2023 COE, the Veteran was granted educational assistance benefits under the MGIB-SR, effective July 31, 2014.  The decision also notified the Veteran that her entitlement was for less than 36 months since she previously used a portion of her benefits from August 28, 1995 to November 18, 1995. 

On April 10, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 challenging the March 25, 2023, decision.  She indicated that the benefits deducted from her full 36-month entitlement was an error because between August 28, 1995 and November 18, 1995, she never filed for the benefit nor received payment for it.   

While pending appellate review, on April 24, 2023, the RO issued a decision in which the Veteran was notified that per Air Force Reserve and DoD records, her claim for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 must be denied because according to the service branch, her eligibility under that program was terminated effective October 11, 1997.  Upon explanation of the legal basis for the denial, the RO indicated the following: 

On March 24, 2023, we issued you a Certificate of Eligibility under the Chapter 1606 program, based on information received from the Air Force Reserve stating that you established a new period of eligibility under the Chapter 1606 program, effective July 31, 2014. This Certificate of Eligibility was issued in error and should be disregarded. We apologize for any inconvenience. 

See decision dated April 24, 2023.  

In May 2023, the Veteran filed a new VA Form 10182 under the Evidence Submission docket.  This time, the Veteran challenged the determination that she did not meet the basic eligibility requirements for entitlement to Chapter 1606 benefits.  The appeal has been certified to the Board and docketed under a separate Docket No. 230508-522542.  In other words, the appeal is currently pending adjudication under a separate docket number and will the subject of a separate Board decision.     

The circumstances of the case have materially changed since the submission of the April 2023 appeal, by virtue of the April 2023 decision with which the RO overrode the March 2023 COE by notifying the Veteran that the decision was issued in error and should be disregarded as her eligibility to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 was terminated effective October 11, 1997.  

As the underlying entitlement to educational assistance benefits that is the subject of this appeal has been removed, there remains no issue in controversy with respect to the appeal as to whether the Veteran used any portion of her now removed entitlement to Chapter 1606 from August 28, 1995 to November 18, 1995.  The matter is moot.  A case is moot if "an event occurs while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party." Church of Scientology v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 12 (1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  

As noted previously, the Board will address the Veteran's basic eligibility requirements for entitlement to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 in a separate future decision.

However, at this time, there is no further relief that the Board can grant to the Veteran through the April 2024 appeal as educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 have been fully removed by the RO.  Id. at 12.  Accordingly, the instant appeal is dismissed as moot.  Id.
