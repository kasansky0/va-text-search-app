ORDER

An effective date prior to November 7, 2023, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Following the issuance of a final December 2017 rating decision, VA received the Veteran's Supplemental Claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder on November 7, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to November 7, 2023, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder have not been met.  38?U.S.C. §?5110; 38?C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2004 to May 2008.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to November 7, 2023, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

In the November 2023 Supplemental Claim, the Veteran contends that a clear and mistakable error ("CUE") occurred when he was denied service connection in December 2017, and, therefore, he is entitled to service connection for PTSD from August 22, 2016, the date of his Intent to File form which preceded his August 2, 2017, claim for service connection for PTSD. 

As an initial matter, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that a CUE occurred, however, the Board cannot address CUE motions that have not been initially adjudicated by the AOJ. Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 333 (2006). Here, the rating decision on appeal did not address CUE, and therefore the issue of whether a CUE occurred is not before the Board. An appeal for an earlier effective date is distinct from a motion for CUE. Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002). 

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r), the effective date based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 

By way of background, on August 2, 2017, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for PTSD, following the receipt of the August 22, 2016, Intent to File. In November 2017, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to develop his claim. In December 2017, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim finding that the Veteran's diagnosed PTSD had no relationship to service. In the same December 2017 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for anxiety as it determined that the evidence did not show a current diagnosed disability.  

The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement in response to the decision. Additionally, no new and material evidence was physically or constructively received within one year of the issuance of the December 2017 rating decision and no relevant service department records have since been received. Therefore, the December 2017 rating decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 20.302, 20.1103.

Thereafter, on November 7, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application asserting the CUE occurred and that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of August 22, 2016, for service connection for PTSD as all criteria for service connection for PTSD were met at the time of the December 2017 rating decision. In December 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to develop his claim. In March 2024, the AOJ issued the decision on appeal which granted service connection for PTSD, effective November 7, 2023. 

Consequently, an effective date prior to November 7, 2023, the date of receipt of the Veteran's Supplemental Claim, for the award of service connection for PTSD is not warranted. The law is clear in this regard and as the prior denial became final, the Veteran is not entitled to an earlier effective date. 

As discussed above, as the AOJ did not adjudicate his CUE contention, the Board cannot adjudicate such issue. The rating decision on appeal granted service connection but did not address the CUE contention. The Board is sympathetic to the delay in consideration of this assertion, but the Board does not have review of the CUE claim at this time. The Veteran, and his attorney representative, are encouraged to seek update from the AOJ on initial consideration of the pending CUE allegation.
