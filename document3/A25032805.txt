ISSUE

Entitlement to a waiver of overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) dependency benefits in the amount of $2,863.44, to include the issue of validity of the debt.

REMANDED

The issue of entitlement to a waiver of overpayment of VA dependency benefits in the amount of $2,863.44, to include the issue of validity of the debt is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from February 2004 to August 2021.

This matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Entitlement to a waiver of overpayment of VA dependency benefits in the amount of $2,863.44, to include the issue of validity of the debt

The Veteran contends that he is not responsible for the overpayment debt created due to the retroactive termination of dependency benefits for his ex-spouse and his stepchild because he notified DEERS of his divorce while in service and before applying for VA compensation benefits.  See November 2023 Financial Status Report (FSR). Alternatively, he contends that he has a debt for a dependent child who is not his biological child.  See April 2024 VA Form 10182.  Finally, he contends, through his representative, that his service-connected traumatic brain injury (TBI) and psychiatric disabilities preclude him from timely reporting changes in dependency.  See August 2024 Representative's Brief. \

In a March 2020 VA Form 21-686c (Application Request to Add and or Remove Dependents), the Veteran listed B.M. as his current spouse and indicated that they resided together.  He reported his date of marriage as September 2019.  He also listed stepchild, E.H. as a dependent - B.M.'s child. 

In a September 2023 VA Form 21-686c, the Veteran indicated that he divorced B.M. in September 2021.  He also reported that his date of their marriage was September 2018. 

That same month, the Regional Office (RO) made retroactive adjustments to the Veteran's award, which resulted in an overpayment debt in the amount of $3,990.67.

In a November 2023 VA Form 21-686c, the Veteran indicated that he divorced B.M. in February 2021.  

In a January 2024 decision, the COWC granted the Veteran's request for a waiver of the overpayment debt in the amount of $4,267.66.  The COWC indicated that the debt period was from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2023 and from August 17, 2023 through August 31, 2023, due to a change in dependency status.  Specifically, the COWC noted that the debt in the amount of $4,167.43 was due to retroactive removal of the Veteran's former spouse, effective October 1, 2021. The remaining overpayment debt in the amount if $100.23 was due to the adjustment of Chapter 35 education benefits for G. 

In a March 2024 decision, the COWC denied the Veteran's request for a waiver of the overpayment debt in the amount of $2,863.44. The COWC indicated that the debt period was from September 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023 due to a change in dependency status.  The COWC noted that the Veteran's award was amended on December 26, 2023, which corrected previous dependency removal dates. 

The Board construes the Veteran's statements as a challenge to the validity of the debt.

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) has not addressed the issue of the validity of the overpayment debt. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board may remand for correction of either a pre-decisional duty to assist error or "any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim." See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. In Schaper v. Derwinski, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) decided it was an error to fail to first adjudicate validity of debt based on the statutory and regulatory waiver consideration of "equity and good conscious." Id. at 437; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5302 (b). As such, the Board considers it a correctible error by the AOJ in satisfying its regulatory and statutory duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5302 (b) and 38 C.F.R. § 1.965 and that correction raises a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim. 

Therefore, the Board finds that a remand is necessary in order to permit the adjudication of the issue of the validity of the debt.  Further, it is unclear as to the proper date of the Veteran's divorce from B.M. and subsequent termination effective date.  On remand, the AOJ should reconcile the proper effective date of the Veteran's divorce. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Adjudicate the issue of whether the overpayment in the amount of $2,863.44 was properly created and the reasons the RO found its creation to be valid.  See November 2023 FSR; April 2024 VA Form 10182.  

The AOJ should reconcile the proper effective date used for the Veteran's divorce.  See September 2023 VA Form 21-686c (September 2021 divorce date); November 2023 VA Form 21-686c (February 2021 divorce date).
