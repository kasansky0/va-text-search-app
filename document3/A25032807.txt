DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his current diagnosis of GERD had onset in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for GERD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1998 to July 1998, from May 2003 to February 2004, and from October 2005 to August 2007.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issue of entitlement to service connection for GERD most recently addressed in a May 2014 rating decision.  In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  Prior to holding a Board hearing, the Veteran submitted written correspondence received in February 2025 in which the Veteran stated that he was withdrawing the current appeal.  The Veteran indicated that he was withdrawing the current appeal for service connection for GERD because he was recently awarded service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and it was his understanding that a separate evaluation for GERD is prohibited.  See January 2025 rating decision (granting service connection for IBS from September 19, 2024).  The current appeal was advanced for a decision based on the February 2025 withdrawal submitted by the Veteran.  

However, the Board notes that the schedule for ratings of the digestive system under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 was amended effective May 19, 2024, updating the criteria for evaluation of digestive conditions for disability rating purposes.  In addition, the Veteran's service connection claim for GERD preceded the Veteran's September 2024 service connection claim for IBS.  In light of such circumstances, the Board finds that the February 2025 correspondence does not demonstrate a full understanding of the consequences of withdrawing the current appeal for service connection for GERD.  See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011) (withdrawal of a claim is effective where the withdrawal is explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant).

As the decision herein constitutes a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal, the Board finds there is no prejudice to the Veteran in not scheduling a Board hearing to address the service connection claim for GERD.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In this case, the Veteran has generally asserted that symptoms of his current diagnosis of GERD had onset in service.  In an April 2014 VA esophageal conditions examination, the Veteran stated that he began to experience sharp chest pains that had onset in service, which he was told was probably heart burn.  See also December 2023 VA esophageal conditions examination.  The Veteran reported such symptoms had continued and increased in severity since his separation from service.  The examiner stated the Veteran had a current diagnosis of GERD, and his current symptoms included persistently recurrent epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, sleep disturbance, and nausea.  

Here, the Veteran's description of symptoms of GERD, to specifically include chest pain, having onset in service is supported by his service treatment records.  See June 2007 DA Form 7349 (noting a history of chest pain, and electrocardiogram results within normal limits).  Additionally, VA treatment records reflect the Veteran had a history of GERD and was started on medication to treat GERD in March 2008, approximately six months following his separation from active duty in August 2007.   

The Veteran is competent to report facts and circumstances that can be observed and described by a lay person.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  In this particular case, the Board finds the Veteran's description of his medical history pertaining to his current diagnosis of GERD to be credible.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay evidence may be competent to establish etiology if the lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional).  As discussed above, the Veteran's report that he experienced chest pain in service is supported by service treatment records, and VA esophageal conditions examinations found that substernal pain is a current symptom of the Veteran's diagnosis of GERD.  Additionally, as noted above, VA treatment records reflect the Veteran had a history of GERD and was started on medication to treat GERD in March 2008, approximately six months following his separation from active duty in August 2007.        

In light of the above, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran in finding that entitlement to service connection for GERD is warranted, and the appeal is granted.
