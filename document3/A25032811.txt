REMANDED

Entitlement to a clothing allowance(s) for the 2020 calendar year is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from September 1983 to June 2004.  See DD 214.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2020 administrative decision of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In a September 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, as the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes the AOJ issued a Supplemental Claim decision in response to a Supplemental Claim filed by the Veteran, after his VA Form 10182 was received by the Board.  See VHA Clothing Allowance file, received on September 20, 2021.  Therefore, the supplemental decision is not before the Board.  Furthermore, as the supplemental claim was filed more than one year after the decision on appeal, and more than 90 days after his VA Form 10182, the Board does not consider, nor has his representative indicated, this indicates an effort to switch dockets.  Therefore, the Board proceeds to the merits of the appeal.

1. Clothing Allowance for 2020 calendar year.

The Veteran contends that because he has received clothing allowances in the past, his 2020 calendar year allowance should be granted.  See September 2020 VA Form 10182; see also August 2022 Informal Hearing Presentation Brief (IHP). 

According to the VHA Clothing Allowance File, the Veteran applied for clothing allowances for a wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury, a steroid cream for a skin disorder, hinged knee braces for his left and right knee, back brace for his back injury, and a shoulder brace for his right shoulder disorder.  See VHA Clothing Allowance File, labeled as VA Form 21-8678 Application for Annual Clothing Allowance, received on February 26, 2024, pg. 2 (containing the 2020 Clothing Allowance Application).  The claims were denied because no evidence of skin conditions or braces were found in the records.  See id. at pg. 12.  

Notwithstanding that there is evidence of skin medication and braces of record, the Board finds that the decision provides inadequate notice as required under 38 U.S.C. § 5104.  Generally, notice under 38 U.S.C. § 5104 must include the following: (1) identification of the issues adjudicated; (2) a summary of the evidence considered by the Secretary; (3) a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; (4) identification of findings favorable to the claimant; (5) in the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial; (6) an explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision; and (7) if applicable, identification of the criteria that must be satisfied to grant the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).  The Board notes that the June 2020 decision does not indicate the type of braces, and the evidence relied on was indicated as the Veteran's application, and "medical records."  No favorable findings were indicated, although he is service connected for bilateral knee disorders, a cervical spine disorder with herniation, bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy, shoulder strain, and fibromyalgia.  See March 2016 Rating Decision Code Sheet.  He also underwent a right rotator cuff surgery in 2010.  See Medical Treatment Record Non-Governmental Facility, received April 12, 2010, pg. 1. 

After a careful review of the record, the Board finds a significant amount of documentation is missing concerning a clothing allowance for 2020 calendar year.  For example, there are no VA treatment records (CAPRI) in the claim file since 2014.  See e.g., CAPRI, received January 2014, May 2013, April 2-13, November 2012, September 2-12, February 2011, June 2010, and April 2010. It is unclear whether the Veteran has not had any VA treatment since 2014, or whether the documents have not been associated with the record.  Furthermore, the Veteran has argued that his private physician prescribed braces and the creams.  However, no private medical records have been associated with the claims file.  Here too, it appears that there are documents missing, and or development that has not been undertaken.  While the Veteran was granted clothing allowances from 2010 through 2019, the record does not indicate what type of allowance, and how many, and for what conditions.  While the Veteran is correct in that he has been granted clothing allowances in the past, the current record is inadequate to determine how many allowances, for which service-connected conditions, cause wear and tear or staining to his clothing.  

The Board considered whether there is adequate evidence in the file with which to decide the claim, but finds that without medical records since 2014, private or otherwise, it is unable to determine what types of braces and topical medications were used for his current conditions.  The Board finds that it does not have a complete record on which it can fulfill its statutory and regulatory duty to render a decision on the Veteran's claims.   Therefore, remand is warranted for the AOJ, which is VHA, to reconstruct the record and associate it with the claims file all relevant clothing allowance records, VA treatment records, and private treatment records, to include prosthetic department records.

Therefore, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error regarding an adequate notice of decision, and an error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty has occurred.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104 (requiring specific information within the notice of a decision), 5107 (requiring that the AOJ consider all lay and medical evidence of record), 5103 (requiring the AOJ ensure that a complete copy of the record before it is made available for the Board's review).

The Veteran is notified that under the modernized appeal system, remands do not automatically return to the Board for additional adjudication.  Should the AOJ deny the claim in whole or in part, and the Veteran wish to continue his appeal before the Board, the Veteran should file an appropriate VA Form 10182 within the applicable appeal period after the AOJ has readjudicated the claim.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the electronic claims file all evidence related to the Veteran's 2020 clothing allowance claims.  The record should include, but is not limited to, prior clothing allowance decisions, notice of disagreements, private and VA medical records, and medical assessments conducted by VHA evaluators for clothing allowances.  Any unsuccessful attempts to obtain these records must be clearly documented.

2. If any records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the Veteran notice of the unavailability of the records. 

3. The AOJ should provide a notice of decision which complies with 38 U.S.C. 5104(b).
