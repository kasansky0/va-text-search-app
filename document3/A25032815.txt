CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria have been met to establish eligibility for VA loan guaranty benefits.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3701, 3702, 5303A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.315(b).  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1994 to February 1995.  The Veteran died in September 2013.  The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.  

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  84 Fed. Reg. 138,171 (Jan. 18, 2019).  This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA's) decision on their claim to seek review.  The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In November 2023, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. Eligibility for VA home loan guaranty benefits.  

A veteran is basically eligible for housing loan benefits if they served after July 25, 1947, for a period of more than 180 days, and was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable.  38 U.S.C. § 3702(a)(1), (2).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to establish eligibility for certain VA benefits, including home loan guaranty benefits, a veteran who initially enters service after September 7, 1980, must generally complete 24 months of continuous active duty service.  38 U.S.C. § 5303A(b)(1)(A).

In this case, the Veteran's DD Form 214 confirms that he served on active duty from August 1994 to February 1995, his only period of active duty service.  This is not a sufficient duration of service to qualify for the loan guaranty benefit sought.  

?

However, there can be exceptions to the general rule regarding duration of service for loan guaranty eligibility, depending on the era in which a veteran served.  For each veteran who after September 15, 1940, was discharged or released from a period of active duty for a service-connected disability or that the official service department records show that he or she had at the time of separation from service a service-connected disability which in medical judgment would have warranted a discharge for disability, an exception to the 180-day duration requirement applies.  38 U.S.C. § 3702(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.315(b).  

In this case, according to a December 1994 medical evaluation board proceeding report, the Veteran was discharged due to right shoulder instability which pre-existed service and was permanently aggravated therein.  Thereafter, in a September 1995 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for right shoulder instability and subluxation status post reconstruction.  Notably, the AOJ found that the Veteran was given a physical disability discharge.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

The critical inquiry in this case is whether the Veteran satisfied the criteria for an exception to the 180-day total service duration requirement for the Appellant to be eligible for VA loan guaranty benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 3702(a)(1), (a)(2)(A).  After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran has satisfied the criteria for an exception to the 180-day duration requirement. 

As provided above, in order for the Appellant to be satisfy the criteria for an exception to the general rule regarding duration of service for loan guaranty eligibility, the Veteran must have either (1) been discharged or released from a period of active duty for a service-connected disability, or (2) the official service department records show that he or she had at the time of separation from service a service-connected disability which in medical judgment would have warranted a discharge for disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3702(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.315(b).  

The Board finds that the Veteran was, in fact, discharged or released from a period of active duty for a service-connected disability, that is, due to his right shoulder disability.  To the extent the Appellant's right shoulder disability pre-existed his active duty service, the Board notes that the criteria for an exception to the 180-day duration requirement make no mention that the disability must be incurred in service, only that the Appellant must be discharged or released from a period of active duty for a service-connected disability.  "Where a statute's language carries a plain meaning, the duty of an administrative agency is to follow its commands as written, not to supplant those commands with others it may prefer."  See Quinn v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 284, 289 (2019) (quoting SAS Inst., Inc. v. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348, 1355 (2018)).  

As the evidence shows the Veteran was discharged from his active duty service due to his right shoulder disability, for which he established service connection, the Veteran has satisfied the criteria for an exception to the minimum duration of service to be applicable in this case.  

Accordingly, the Appellant satisfies the basic eligibility criteria for VA loan guaranty benefits, and the claim is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 3702; 38 C.F.R. § 3.315(b).
