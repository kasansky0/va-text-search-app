REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2001 to November 2005 and from November 2008 to December 2009.  The matter is on appeal under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) from a rating decision issued in March 2022.  In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

In this case, the Veteran opted into the AMA via a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review in October 2020, following the issuance of the September 2020 Statement of the Case (SOC).  A Higher-Level Review rating decision was issued in February 2021, and the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application in February 2022.  In March 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the rating decision on appeal.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 supplemental claim rating decision on appeal. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the March 2022 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is remanded.  

Entitlement to service connection for a left leg disability, to include anterior compartment syndrome is remanded.

Initially, the Board notes that the March 2022 rating decision on appeal found that the previous denials of service connection for a back disability and a left leg disability were not considered to have been clearly and unmistakably erroneous because the alleged error involved an exercise in judgment which could not be characterized as undebatably erroneous.  However, a review of the record reveals that the Veteran has not filed a motion seeking revision of a VA decision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE), as the March 2022 rating decision would appear to indicate.  

Rather, the procedural history shows that following the Veteran's initial claim for service connection in February 2018, a March 2019 rating decision denied the issues on appeal.  The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement in August 2019, and the SOC was issued in September 2020.  As indicated above, the Veteran then opted into the AMA via a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review.  A Higher-Level Review rating decision was issued in February 2021, and the Veteran then submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application in February 2022.  In March 2022, the AOJ issued the rating decision on appeal.  The evidence shows that the Veteran has prosecuted his claims continuously since he filed his original claim in February 2018.  The filing of Higher-Level Review in October 2020 within one year of the September 2020 SOC and filing of the supplemental claim in February 2022, within one year of the February 2021 Higher-Level Review rating decision was sufficient to maintain the continuous prosecution of the original claims for service connection under 38 U.S.C. § 3.2501.  Thus, the Board will address the claims for service connection.

The AMA provides that a remand is warranted based on a pre-decisional duty to assist error and errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Regarding the issue of service connection for a back disability, the most recent March 2022 VA examiner (who conducted an examination prior to the decision on appeal) found that the back disability was less likely than not related to service because there was no chronicity of care, and symptoms were subjective only.  Arthritis was found in X-ray evidence dated in August 2020, but this was 12 years after service.  However, the March 2022 VA examiner seems to have discounted the lay testimony without providing a medical reason for finding the statements unreliable or inadequate to show chronicity.  

Regarding the issue of service connection for a left leg disability, the March 2022 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran was diagnosed with compartment syndrome, nontraumatic, left leg in 2009.  However, the examiner opined that the condition was less likely than not related to service because no chronic diagnosis was made for left leg compartment syndrome, and symptoms were subjective only.  The examiner's contradictory findings and conclusions render the opinion inadequate.  

As the March 2022 medical opinions are inadequate for the reasons discussed, it constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand for new VA examinations are necessary.     

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination(s) with an appropriate clinician regarding the current nature and etiology of his a) back disability; and b) left leg disability, to include anterior compartment syndrome.  The electronic claims file must be made available to the examiner for review.

Following an examination of the Veteran and a review of the claims file, the examiner must address the following:

a)	The examiner must clearly identify all current diagnoses of a left leg disability.  

If left leg anterior compartment syndrome is not diagnosed, the examiner must discuss the diagnosis of compartment syndrome, nontraumatic, left leg in 2009 in service and explain why there is no current diagnosis.  

b)	Regarding any back disability, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's diagnosed back disabilities (thoracic/lumbosacral) are related to his active service, to include his July 2004 in-service motor vehicle accident and subsequent treatment (in July 2004 and August 2004) for thoracic/lumbosacral strain.

c)	Regarding any left leg disability, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran has a left leg disability, to include anterior compartment syndrome, that is related to his active service.  In rendering this opinion, the examiner must discuss September 2008, April 2009, July 2009, August 2009, and September 2009 service treatment records that show that the Veteran was put on a profile for and was diagnosed with compartment syndrome, nontraumatic, left leg.

A complete rationale for all opinions must be provided.  The examiner must consider and discuss the lay statements from the Veteran (including from February 2022).  

If the clinician cannot provide a requested opinion without resorting to speculation, it must be so stated, and the clinician must provide the reasons why an opinion would require speculation.  The clinician must indicate whether there was any further need for information or testing necessary to make a determination.  Additionally, the clinician must indicate whether any opinion could not be rendered due to limitations of knowledge in the medical community at large and not those of the particular examiner.
