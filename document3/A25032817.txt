REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 2, 2018 for the assignment of a 100 percent disability rating for the service-connected seizure disorder due to traumatic brain injury (TBI), previously rated with TBI, is remanded. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 2, 2018 for the grant of SMC based on housebound criteria being met is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2003 to March 2007. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2020 Statement of the Case (SOC) issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). Because the January 2020 SOC on appeal was issued after February 19, 2019, it is subject to the Appeals Modernization Act ("AMA"). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400(a)(1); 19.2(a). The January 2020 SOC denied entitlement to effective dates earlier than March 2, 2018 for the grant of an increase to 100 percent for the service-connected seizure disorder and entitlement to SMC based on housebound status. 

By way of background, a May 2007 rating decision granted service connection for alteration of consciousness with head and right arm tremors associated with memory loss (also claimed as seizure disorder and right arm twitching), with an initial 20 percent disability rating from March 29, 2007. 

In November 2007, the Veteran filed an initial increased rating claim seeking a higher evaluation for his service-connected TBI with seizure disorder. In a January 2008 rating decision, the Veteran's disability rating for the service-connected TBI with seizure disorder was increased from 20 to 60 percent from November 26, 2007. A February 2008 rating decision confirmed and continued the 60 percent evaluation. The Veteran did not appeal the January 2008 or February 2008 rating decisions. 

Subsequently, the Veteran submitted an intent to file an increased rating claim for his service-connected TBI with seizure disorder, which was received on March 2, 2018. 

In June 2018, a rating decision was issued by the RO under the legacy system of appeals. The rating decision, in part, granted service connection for seizure disorder due to TBI, previously rated with TBI, with an evaluation of 100 percent effective March 2, 2018 and entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria being met from March 2, 2018. 

In July 2018, the Veteran filed a request for reconsideration, requesting earlier effective dates for the grants of the above benefits. In an August 2018 rating decision, the RO denied entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 2, 2018 for the grant of SMC based on housebound status. A December 2018 rating decision continued the 100 percent disability rating for the service-connected seizure disorder. 

In January 2019, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to the June 2018 rating decision, requesting earlier effective dates for the grants of the above benefits. An SOC was issued in January 2020 denying entitlement to effective dates earlier than March 2, 2018 for the grant of an increase to 100 percent for the service-connected seizure disorder and entitlement to SMC based on housebound status. 

The Veteran opted the claims into the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) by submitting a January 2020 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, identifying the January 2020 SOC and electing the Evidence Submission docket. Thus, the January 2020 SOC is the decision on appeal. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2020 SOC on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding these claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

This matter was previously before the Board in September 2023 when the Board denied the claims of entitlement to effective dates earlier than March 2, 2018 for the grant of an increase to 100 percent for the service-connected seizure disorder and entitlement to SMC based on housebound status. The September 2023 decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). 

In December 2024, the Court issued a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) vacating and remanding the Board's September 2023 decision and remanding the claim to the Board for action consistent with the JMR.  

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 2, 2018, for the assignment of a 100 percent disability rating for the service-connected seizure disorder due to TBI, previously rated with TBI, is remanded.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 2, 2018 for the grant of SMC based on housebound criteria being met is remanded.

The parties to the December 2024 JMR found that the Board erred by failing to provide adequate reasons or bases for its decision. Specifically, the parties noted that in denying an effective date prior to March 2018 for a 100 percent rating for seizures with TBI, the Board found that there was no evidence within the one-year lookback period prior to the date of claim that would warrant an earlier effective date for a 100 percent rating. However, the parties found that the Board failed to identify which Diagnostic Code (DC) and corresponding rating criteria upon which it relied to determine whether the severity of the Veteran's condition had worsened within the one-year lookback period. Additionally, the parties found that the Board failed to adequately address an April 2018 VA examination noting that the "number of major seizures in the past year" was greater than just once a month.

After the Court issued the December 2024 JMR, the Veteran's representative submitted an Appellate Brief in March 2025. In the Appellate Brief, the Veteran's representative argued, in part, that finality did not attach to the January 2008 and February 2008 rating decisions because new and material VA treatment records were constructively received within one year of those decisions. Because these VA treatment records were not addressed in any subsequent rating decision, the Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran's November 2007 initial increased rating claim has remained pending since his separation from service in 2007. 

The Board will first address the finality of the January 2008 and February 2008 rating decisions. As noted above, the Veteran's service-connected TBI with seizure disorder was originally granted in a May 2007 rating decision, effective March 29, 2007. In November 2007, the Veteran filed an initial increased rating claim seeking a higher evaluation, and in a January 2008 rating decision a rating of 60 percent was granted, effective November 26, 2007. A February 2008 rating decision confirmed and continued the 60 percent evaluation. The Veteran did not appeal the January 2008 or February 2008 rating decisions. 

Subsequently, the Veteran submitted an intent to file an increased rating claim for his service-connected TBI with seizure disorder, which was received on March 2, 2018. In a June 2018 rating decision, service connection for seizure disorder due to TBI, previously rated with TBI, was granted with an evaluation of 100 percent effective March 2, 2018 and entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria being met from March 2, 2018. 

Generally, a claim that has been denied in an unappealed RO decision or an unappealed Board decision may not thereafter be reopened and allowed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(b), 7105(c). The exception is that if new and material evidence is presented or secured with respect to a claim which has been disallowed, VA shall reopen the claim and review the former disposition of the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5108.

New evidence means evidence not previously submitted to agency decision-makers. Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), "[n]ew and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period, or prior to the appellate decision if a timely appeal has been filed . . . will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal." 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held that section 3.156(b) "requires [] VA to 'assess any evidence submitted during the relevant period and make a determination as to whether it constitutes new and material evidence relating to the old claim.'" Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1405 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2011)); see Voracek v. Nicholson, 421 F.3d 1299, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (explaining that the requirements of section 3.156(b) extend not only to newly submitted evidence, but also "evidence incorporated therein by reference"). If and until VA does so, the claim remains pending and unadjudicated and a subsequent award of benefits may date back to the original date of the claim. Beraud, 766 F.3d at 1407; Young v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 461, 468-69 (2009).

In Lang v. Wilkie, the Federal Circuit explained that the Bell doctrine of constructive receipt applies to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) and held that "[e]vidence is constructively received by the VA adjudicator if it (1) was generated by [] VA or was submitted to [] VA and (2) can reasonably be expected to be connected to the veteran's claim." 971 F.3d 1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2020). In that case, the Federal Circuit found that the appellant's "post-decisional [VA] medical records were constructively received by the VA adjudicator prior to the expiration of the one-year appeal period," explaining that "[m]edical records created by the VAMC as a result of the treatment of a specific veteran are necessarily received by the VA adjudicator of that veteran's claims because all such records can reasonably be expected to be connected to the veteran's claims."  Id. at 1354-55.

Turning to the evidence, the Board observes that the Veteran did not initiate an appeal of the January 2008 rating decision, which granted a rating of 60 percent for the Veteran's seizure disorder, effective November 26, 2007. Nor did the Veteran initiate an appeal of the February 2008 rating decision that confirmed and continued the 60 percent evaluation. 

However, in April 2018, additional VA treatment records were associated with the claims file. These records spanned the period from April 2007 to November 2017. Notably, an October 2008 VA treatment record indicated that the Veteran continued to have "episodes" where he would have loss of consciousness and fall to the floor two to three times per week. Additionally, a November 2008 VA treatment record indicated that the Veteran coughed and vomited in the morning, was seen at Fort Hood for a seizure, and was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. 

After careful review of the record, the Board finds that neither the January 2008 nor the February 2008 rating decisions became final. The Board finds that VA was in constructive receipt of the October 2008 and November 2008 VA treatment records during the one-year period following the January 2008 and February 2008 rating decisions. Accordingly, the VA treatment records were "received" such that VA was obligated to determine whether the evidence constituted new and material evidence relating to the initial increased rating claim. However, no subsequent rating decision directly responded to these VA treatment records. Therefore, the Board must address whether these treatment records constitute new and material evidence such that the Veteran's November 2007 initial increased rating claim remained pending. 

The Board concludes that the October 2008 and November 2008 VA treatment records constitute new and material evidence. The treatment records are new because they were not previously submitted to the AOJ at the time of the January and February 2008 rating decisions. Additionally, the treatment records are material because they contain notations of symptoms that were not previously indicated in the VA treatment records reviewed by the AOJ at the time of the January 2008 and February 2008 rating decisions. Specifically, the October 2008 indication that the Veteran "fell to the floor" two to three times per week with loss of consciousness was not contained in the VA treatment records that were reviewed by the AOJ at the time of the January 2008 and February 2008 rating decisions. Nor did the previously reviewed records mention vomiting with coughing in the morning. These symptoms also relate to unestablished facts necessary to substantiate the Veteran's increased rating claim as they are suggestive of more severe symptoms under § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8045-8914, which was the DC used to rate the Veteran's seizure disorder in the January 2008 and February 2008 rating decisions. Because no AOJ rating decision directly addressed the October 2008 and November 2008 VA treatment records and the Board has determined that they constitute new and material evidence, the Board finds that the January 2008 and February 2008 rating decisions were not final. Thus, the November 2007 initial increased rating claim remained pending. 

Accordingly, the remaining issues for determination are: 1) whether the Veteran is entitled to a higher rating for his seizure disorder due to TBI from March 29, 2007 to March 1, 2018, and 2) whether the Veteran is entitled to an effective date earlier than March 2, 2018 for the grant of SMC based on housebound criteria being met. For the reasons set forth below, these issues are remanded to correct a pre-decisional error to assist the Veteran in the development of his claims. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Specifically, the Board notes that there is conflicting medical evidence during the period of March 29, 2007 to March 1, 2018 concerning the nature and severity of the Veteran's seizure disorder. The Board acknowledges that VA examinations were obtained in May 2007, December 2007, and April 2018. The May 2007 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran was diagnosed with a seizure disorder shortly after returning from Iraq; however, the examiner noted that the Veteran never lost consciousness or had any generalized body convulsions from his seizure episodes. This conflicts with subsequent VA treatment records indicating that the Veteran's seizures consisted of loss of consciousness, including falling to the floor, with hand and head twitching and rigidity. See September 2007 - September 2009 VA treatment records. Additionally, there are conflicting diagnoses of record concerning the Veteran's seizures during this time period, including diagnoses of pseudoseizures, partial complex seizures, and seizure disorder. See October 2007 VA treatment record; November 2007 VA treatment record; December 2007 VA examination; August 2007 VA treatment record. 

The April 2018 VA examiner acknowledged the conflicting diagnoses of record, but ultimately provided a diagnosis of seizure disorder associated with TBI. The examiner further indicated that the Veteran had a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy with a history of seizures and noted that the Veteran has had major seizures (characterized by the generalized tonic-clonic convulsions with unconsciousness) with frequency of at least two in the past year and an average frequency of at least one per month over the past year. The examiner indicated that the Veteran never had minor seizures, minor psychomotor seizures, or major psychomotor seizures. While the Board finds the April 2018 VA examination adequate, it notes that the examiner's findings only speak to the nature and severity of the Veteran's symptoms from the year prior to the examination onward, and do not address the nature and severity of the Veteran's symptoms for the remainder of the review period. The Board further acknowledges that, during this period, the Veteran's VA treatment records document seizure symptoms during that time; however, the records are unclear as to whether the Veteran was experiencing major versus minor seizures during that time and the frequency of said seizures.

Accordingly, the Board finds the medical evidence of record from March 29, 2007 to March 1, 2018 is insufficient for rating purposes, and that there was a pre-decisional duty to assist error in failing to obtain a medical opinion that is sufficient to make an informed decision on the claim. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103A(a), 5103A(d)(2)(C); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Remand is warranted to obtain a medical opinion to address the nature and severity of the Veteran's seizure symptoms from March 29, 2007 to March 1, 2018. Specifically, an opinion is needed to clarify whether the Veteran was experiencing major or minor seizures during this time and the frequency of such seizures. 

Finally, because a decision on whether the Veteran is entitled to a higher rating for his service-connected seizure disorder due to TBI from March 29, 2007 to March 1, 2018 could significantly impact a decision on the issue of an earlier effective date for SMC based on housebound status, the issues are inextricably intertwined. Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991). As such, remand of the claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 2, 2018 for the grant of SMC based on housebound criteria is required.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a retrospective opinion from an appropriate clinician to assist in determining the nature and severity of the Veteran's service-connected seizure disorder due to TBI during the period of March 29, 2007 to March 1, 2018. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability during that period and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's seizure disorder under the rating criteria. The examiner should specifically opine on whether the seizures reported in the Veteran's VA treatment records during this period were considered major versus minor seizures and clarify the frequency of such seizures. In doing so, the examiner must specifically address the October 2008 VA treatment record indicating that the Veteran continued to have "episodes" where he would lose consciousness and fall to the floor two to three times per week.

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and treatment, and that his reports must be taken into account in formulating the requested opinion.
