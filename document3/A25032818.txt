CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for corneal erosions have been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 5103A, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.306. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for dry eye syndrome have been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 5103A, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.159, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had service in the Commissioned Corps of The Public Health Service from August 2017 to March 2021.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in October 2023 and December 2023 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 and December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the Veteran's January 2024 VA Form 10182 appeals both the issue of entitlement to service connection for corneal erosions denied in the December 2023 rating decision and the issue of entitlement to service connection for dry eye denied in the October 2023 rating decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for corneal erosions

The Veteran appealed a denial of service connection for corneal erosions, arguing that although she had the condition prior to service, it worsened during service.

A veteran who served after December 31, 1946, is presumed to be in sound condition when he or she entered into military service, except for conditions noted on the entrance examination, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1111, 1132. Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted. 38?C.F.R. §?3.304(b). History provided by a veteran of the pre-service existence of conditions recorded at the time of the entrance examination does not, in itself, constitute a notation of a preexisting condition. 38?C.F.R. §?3.304(b)(1); Paulson v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?466, 470 (1995); Crowe v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?238, 246 (1995). 

When no preexisting condition is noted upon entry into service, a veteran is presumed to have been sound upon entry, and the presumption of soundness arises. The burden then shifts to VA to rebut the presumption of soundness by clear and unmistakable evidence that a veteran's disability was both preexisting and not aggravated by service. Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Horn v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?231, 234 (2012). If this burden is met, then the veteran is not entitled to service-connected benefits, and, conversely, where the presumption is not rebutted, the veteran's claim is one for service connection, and not aggravation. Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

The determination of whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence that a defect, infirmity, or disorder existed prior to service should be based upon "thorough analysis of the evidentiary showing and careful correlation of all material facts, with due regard to accepted medical principles pertaining to the history, manifestations, clinical course, and character of the particular injury or disease or residuals thereof." 38?C.F.R. §?3.304(b)(1). 

On the other hand, where a disorder is noted on service entrance or a Veteran is otherwise not presumed sound on entrance, 38?U.S.C. §?1153 applies. In such claims, the evidence of record must simply show that there was an increase in disability during service to trigger the presumption of aggravation. See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Jensen v. Brown, 19 F.3d 1413, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 1994). "If the presumption of aggravation under section 1153 arises, the burden then shifts to the government to show a lack of aggravation by establishing 'that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease.'" Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096 (citing 38?U.S.C. §?1153). This requires the government show by clear and unmistakable evidence that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the condition. Cotant v. Principi, 17?Vet. App.?116, 130-32 (2003); Horn v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?at 235 (2012) ("Once the Veteran establishes worsening, the burden shifts to the Secretary to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the worsening of the condition was due to the natural progress of the disease."); see also 38?C.F.R. §?3.306(b). 

Clear and unmistakable evidence means that the evidence "cannot be misinterpreted and misunderstood, i.e., it is undebatable." Quirin v. Shinseki, 22?Vet. App.?390, 396 (2009) (quoting Yanerson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?254, 258-59 (1999)). The clear-and-unmistakable-evidence standard is an "onerous" one. Laposky v. Brown, 4?Vet. App.?331, 334 (1993) (citing Akins v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?228, 232 (1991)); see also Yanerson, 12?Vet. App.?at 263 (Nebeker, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("[O]nly an inference that is iron clad and copper riveted can be 'unmistakable.'").

Here, the Veteran's eyes were noted to be normal at her October 2016 commissioning examination. As the presumption of soundness applies, the relevant question is whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's sleep apnea both pre-existed service and was not aggravated by service.  

The Veteran's report of medical history form completed at the time of her entrance notes, "History of corneal abrasions in the past, treated with muro eye ointment, completely healed, no complications. Use refresh eyedrops for dryness as needed." 

In an October 2023 statement, the Veteran agreed that she had had periodic corneal abrasions prior to her active service but stated that the condition notably worsened during service.

As the Veteran's recurrent corneal abrasions are not listed on her entrance medical examination, the Veteran is presumed sound on entry into service. However, the Board finds that the evidence is clear and unmistakable that she did have corneal abrasions prior to service. The history is noted on her report of medical history form, private treatment records reflect treatment for the condition prior to service, and the Veteran has confirmed it in statements to the VA.

Thus, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's condition was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated by service. 

In an October 2023 statement, the Veteran reported that prior to service she only used eye ointment as needed but during service her condition worsened and since September 2017 she has had to use eye ointment daily and often remoisten during the night. 

The evidence reflects that in September 2017 the Veteran was treated for a right corneal abrasion. 

Private treatment records indicate she was seen in January 2019 for corneal abrasions. An October 2019 VA treatment record reflects that Veteran reported her symptoms had worsened again as the dissolvable punctal plugs placed in her eyes approximately 10 months earlier had dissolved. She reported the plugs had helped with symptom management and prevention of recurring corneal erosions.

A July 2020 yearly report of medical history report indicates that she had no complications from her history of corneal abrasions, which were healed.

Less than a month later, in August 2020, a VA treatment record indicates that the Veteran sought treatment for an acute corneal erosion requiring urgent contact bandage treatment. A September 2020 private treatment record notes a diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis. 

The Veteran's March 2021 separation report of medical history notes that the Veteran had last had a corneal erosion two days earlier. The report notes she had a history of recurrent corneal erosions, treated with contact bandage, punctal plugs, and muro eye ointment.

The Board finds the evidence supports that there was an increase in the Veteran's disability during service. Prior to service, the evidence reflects she treated her condition with ointment only as needed. Pre-service private treatment records reflect treatment for periodic erosions, including once each in 2011, 2012; twice in 2016, and once in 2017 prior to her entry into service. During service, the evidence reflects she was seen in September 2017, January 2019, October 2019, August 2020, and March 2021 for erosions and received additional treatment, including contact bandage, punctal plugs, and regular use of eye drops and eye ointment. The history indicated on the Veteran's August 2023 VA examination is that she has had bilateral recurrent erosions every few weeks since 2017. The Board finds that giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the evidence supports an increase in her corneal abrasions during service.

The Board notes that an August 2023 VA examiner opined that the condition was not aggravated beyond its natural progression. However, the examiner's rationale was that there was no aggravation based on exam findings and best corrected visual acuity of 20/20 bilaterally at the time of the examination. The Board finds this opinion has no probative value. As the VA examiner indicated on the VA examination report, the Veteran's corneal erosions occur and then heal, and at the time of the examination she did not have an active erosion. However, the VA examiner also noted the Veteran's history of bilateral recurrent erosions every few weeks since 2017. The nature of the Veteran's condition is that it flares up, and there is no requirement that it be constant to constitute a disability. In fact, the Board notes that the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye allows for ratings based on incapacitating episodes.

There is not clear and unmistakable evidence that the increase in the Veteran's disability was due to the natural progress of the condition.

As a result, the Board finds that the Government has not met its burden to demonstrate by clear and unmistakable error that the condition pre-existed service and was not aggravated beyond its natural progress by service, sufficient to rebut the presumption of soundness. Therefore, an in-service incurrence is conceded, and the second element of Shedden has been met.

Thus, the remaining question is whether there is evidence of nexus. The Veteran has consistently alleged that her condition preexisted service and got worse during service. As outlined above, she was treated multiple times for the corneal erosion throughout service. At this stage, there is no material dispute that the Veteran's current corneal erosion condition is the same condition that preexisted and was aggravated during service.

Based on the forgoing, and giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that service connection for aggravation of pre-existing recurrent corneal abrasions should be granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for dry eyes 

The Veteran filed separate claims for service connection for dry eyes and corneal erosions. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The AOJ made a favorable finding in the October 2023 rating decision that "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service. Your service treatment records show treatment for dry eyes on October 4, 2019." Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The Veteran's eyes were noted to be normal at her October 2016 commissioning examination, thus she is presumed sound on entry into service. The record reflects that the Veteran was diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis in September 2020 during service. 

A May 2023 private treatment record indicates she continued to be diagnosed with Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca, for which she is prescribed artificial tears, during the period on appeal. 

The August 2023 VA examination did not diagnose Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca or dry eye syndrome but also did not address that the Veteran's private treatment records currently reflect that diagnosis and have since September 2020. The Board finds the opinion has little probative weight.

The Board finds that the private treatment records are persuasive evidence that the Veteran has a current disability.

Thus, as there is a favorable finding that the Veteran's dry eye condition onset in service and the Board finds that the Veteran continues to be diagnosed with the same condition, the elements of service connection are met.

Giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that service connection for dry eye syndrome is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
