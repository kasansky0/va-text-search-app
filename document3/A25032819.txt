CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for ulcerative colitis are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from June 1973 to August 1976.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from two rating decisions, dated November 2023 and January 2024, issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran timely appealed these decisions to the Board by requesting the Direct Review docket; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal regarding the issue of service connection for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease and at the time of the January 2024 rating decision regarding the issue of service connection for ulcerative colitis.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted with respect to those issues after the November 2023 and January 2024 AOJ decisions cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

Service Connection Legal Authority

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.

In this case, the diagnoses are ulcerative colitis and lumbar spine degenerative disc disease, which do not qualify as a "chronic disease" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, the presumptive service connection provisions based on "chronic" in service symptoms and "continuous" post-service symptoms under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) do not apply.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the Board gives the veteran the benefit of the doubt in resolving the issue.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021) (en banc); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1.  Service Connection for Ulcerative Colitis is Granted.

The Veteran appeals for service connection for ulcerative colitis.  See March 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.  He asserts that his stomach symptoms began while he was in service, where he had loose bowels and went to the bathroom 4 or 5 times per day.  The Veteran self medicated for many years and attributed the stomach symptoms to nerves.  Once he noticed blood in the stools, he sought treatment and was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in the 1980s, and has been treated for the condition ever since.  

After a review of all of the lay and medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in relative equipoise on the question of whether there was an onset of symptoms in service that were later diagnosed as ulcerative colitis, that is, whether the later diagnosed ulcerative colitis was directly "incurred in" service.    See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  While there is no diagnosis specifically for a gastrointestinal condition during service, service treatment records reflect that the Veteran complained of and sought treatment for abdominal pain in February 1974 and January 1976.  Moreover, the Veteran's lay statement credibly asserts that stomach symptoms began during service and continued since that time, and the symptoms for which he sought treatment after service were diagnosed as ulcerative colitis.    

In the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable findings that there was a current diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, and that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service.  Specifically, the AOJ noted that service treatment records dated January 22, 1976 showed a complaint of abdominal pain during service.  The Board is bound by favorable findings made by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).    

Thus, the Board is granting the service connection claim based on the favorable finding that the symptoms of the current ulcerative colitis onset in service and, therefore, were directly "incurred in" service.  The finding, based on consistent and credible lay evidence, which establishes the persistence of ulcerative colitis symptoms since service is supportive of the direct service connection theory of the claim overall because it tends to show that the symptoms that began in service were the basis for the later diagnosed ulcerative colitis disability.  See Horowitz v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 217, 221-22 (1993) (lay statements are competent on in-service and post-service symptoms - dizziness, loss of balance, hearing trouble, stumble and fall, and tinnitus - that were later diagnosed as Meniere's disease).   

For these reasons, and after resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the ulcerative colitis disability was directly incurred in active service; thus, the criteria for direct service connection for ulcerative colitis are met.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  As such, a direct medical nexus opinion is not necessary to decide this claim. 

2.  Service Connection for Lumbar Spine Degenerative Disc Disease is Granted.

The Veteran appeals for service connection for a back disability, which has been diagnosed as lumbar spine degenerative disc disease.  See June 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.  The Veteran asserts that his back problems began during service due to repetitive heavy lifting of guns during drills and fire missions.  During a September 2020 VA examination for a back condition, the Veteran asserted that the back pain began in service, and would subside and return later, and reported current symptoms that included pain when walking, bending, or twisting the body, and pain that sometimes radiates down the left leg.  See September 2024 VA Examination.  

In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable findings that there was a current diagnosis of lumbar spine degenerative disc disease and that the evidence shows a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service.  The finding of in-service event was based on service treatment records showing treatment for complaints of low back pain.  The Board is bound by favorable findings made by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).    

After a review of all the lay and medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in relative equipoise on the question of whether there were symptoms of low back pain in service and since service separation that were later diagnosed as lumbar spine degenerative disc disease, i.e., whether the current low back disability was directly "incurred in" service.  The March 1973 enlistment Report of Medical Examination makes no mention of an abnormality of the lumbar spine and shows that the Veteran denied any history of recurrent back pain upon service entrance.  Thereafter, service treatment records show that the Veteran was treated for episodes of low back pain during service.  The Veteran complained of and sought treatment for low back pain six times between 1974 and 1976.  He denied any specific trauma during treatment in service, but stated there was pain when stooping.  The medical examiner in service noted clinical signs of muscle spasm.  The Veteran stated that he was young at the time and did not realize the impact of repetitive heavy lifting would have on his back.  See June 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.  

The Board finds that the Veteran has provided credible lay statements that he developed symptoms of pain in the back due to heavy lifting as a gunner on a 155mm Howitzer towed cannon.  The primary military occupational specialty (MOS) during service is listed as 13B00 FA Crewman.  See DD Form 214.  The Board further finds the Veteran's account of in-service back pain due to heavy lifting to carry out job duties to be credible and consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  He states that he has self-medicated with anything to try to relieve the pain.  

While the diagnosed lumbar spine degenerative disc disease is not a chronic disease listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), as indicated above, the Board has nonetheless found there were symptoms of low back pain that began during service and continued since service separation, which symptoms were later diagnosed as lumbar spine degenerative disc disease.  The onset of symptoms during service that persisted since service and were later diagnosed tends to show direct service incurrence.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d).  The Board is granting the service connection claim based on evidence, including that pertinent to service, which establishes that symptoms of the low back disability began in service, so was "incurred in" service.  For these reasons, and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the criteria for direct service connection for the lumbar spine degenerative disc disease have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
