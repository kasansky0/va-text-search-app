ORDER

For the increased rating period on appeal beginning June 2, 2020, an increased disability rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected left knee instability is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

During the increased rating period on appeal, from June 2, 2020, the service-connected left knee instability manifested as no more than slight instability. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

During the entire increased disability rating period on appeal, from June 2, 2020, the criteria for an increased disability rating in excess of 10 percent for the service-connected left knee instability have not been met or more nearly approximated.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from August 1981 to July 1992.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board by requesting the Direct Review docket; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and confirmed and continued in the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the January 2023 AOJ decision cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

In the September 2024 Appellate Brief, the Veteran's representative requested a copy of the October 2022 VA examiner's curriculum vitae and other information about the qualifications of the examiner.  Such requests generally trigger VA's duty to assist.  See Nohr v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 124 (2014).  However, under the Appeals Modernization Act, the Board may remand a case for correction of an error in satisfying the duty to assist only if that error occurred prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  In this case, the representative's request for information regarding the October 2022 VA examiner's qualifications was made after the AOJ's January 2023 rating decision.  Because there was no error in satisfying VA's duty to assist prior to the January 2023 rating decision on appeal, the Board is without authority to remand the issue for the AOJ to address the September 2024 request.  

Due Process Considerations

First, the Board turns to the Veteran's representative's assertion in the September 2024 Appellate Brief that remand for a new examination with a specialist is warranted because the examiner who conducted the most recent VA examination in October 2022, a nurse practitioner, was not competent to perform the examination. Accordingly, the Board will analyze the examiner's qualifications.  See Francway v. Wilkie, 940 F.3d 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2019).

VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual, M21-1, in Section IV.i.3.A.1 provides for examination report requirements and qualification requirements of examiners.  It imposes certain requirements on professionals conducting initial mental disorder examinations, initial traumatic brain injury examinations, and examinations for hearing loss and tinnitus.  It does not include any requirements for examiners performing evaluations of orthopedic conditions.  Although the M21-1 is not binding on the Board, in this case, reliance on the M21-1 provisions is appropriate as these provisions address the matter at issue.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.105; Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75, 80 (2021).

Here, the examiner was indeed a nurse practitioner, but neither the title nor the contentions suggest a lack of education, training, or experience to conduct a VA joints examination by following VA procedures.  Neither the Veteran nor the representative has raised any actual argument as to why this nurse practitioner is not competent by education, training, and experience to provide a VA examination of the left knee instability disability.  A compensation examination consists of taking a medical history, which was done in this case, then taking measures of knee ranges of motion and in various positions, which were specifically measured and reported in this case, and making basic assessments about functional impairments.  The examination report is not rendered inadequate solely by the asserted lack of expertise of a recognized medical professional, and VA specialists are not required for routine orthopedic examinations for rating purposes.  There is nothing asserted to render this case to be unique such that a specialist's expertise would be required.  The issue is a rating issue, not a complex nexus opinion regarding causal relationships over a long period of time.  This is also a compensation examination to measure and assess limitations; the examiner is not treating the knee disability or recommending specific treatments or procedures.  The representative's allegation is a generalization and offers no specific reason to question the fitness of the examination provider or the adequacy of the examination report.  The Veteran has not produced any evidence to show that the examiner relied on incorrect or inaccurate medical principles or misapplied or misconstrued medico-scientific data or standards in furnishing the October 2022 VA examination report or otherwise did not conduct the examination according to VA guidelines.

Furthermore, there is no indication that the examination is inadequate for rating purposes.  The examination report shows that the file was reviewed and that an in-person history and examination was conducted.  The examination complies with the weight-bearing requirements in Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158, 168 (2016) and flareup considerations of Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 34-36 (2017); thus, the Board does not find remand is warranted and will proceed with the merits of this rating issue.  

Disability Ratings Legal Authority

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

Where there is a question as to which of two disability ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  It is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case.  When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  Pyramiding, the rating of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when rating a veteran's service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  It is possible for a veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury which would permit rating under several diagnostic codes; however, the critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits compensating a veteran twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).

Where an increase in an existing disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). The relevant temporal focus for adjudicating an increased rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

When evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 allows for consideration of functional loss due to pain and weakness causing additional disability beyond that reflected on range of motion measurements.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  Further, 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 provides that consideration also be given to decreased movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement, swelling, and deformity or atrophy of disuse.  Painful motion is considered limited motion at the point that pain actually sets in.  See VAOPGCPREC 9-98.

A veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).

Various portions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended effective February 7, 2021.  85 Fed. Reg. 230 (Nov. 30, 2020).  If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); see also Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; Kuzma, 341 F. 3d 1327. 

Rating Knee Instability from June 2, 2020

The Veteran appeals for an increased rating for the service-connected left knee instability.  For the increased rating review period from June 2, 2020, the service-connected left knee instability is rated at 10 percent under the criteria at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.

Diagnostic Code 5257 contemplates "other impairment" of the knee including recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  Under Diagnostic Code 5257, where impairment is severe, moderate, or slight, disability ratings of 30, 20, and 10 percent are assigned, respectively.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  The terms "slight," "moderate," and "severe" are not defined in the rating schedule.  According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 2007), "slight" means small in amount.  "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect.  "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are equitable and just as contemplated by the requirements of the law.  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  

A VA examination was conducted in June 2020.  In July 2020, the AOJ continued the 10 percent rating after determining that the knee disability had not sufficiently worsened to warrant a higher rating.  See July 2020 Rating Decision.  However, in August 2022, the Board remanded the left knee instability rating issue after finding that the June 2020 examination did not comply with Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. at 170, because it did not provide range of motion measurements for active and passive motion, with weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing.  See August 2022 Board Decision.  The Board thus remanded the matter for a new examination of the knee.  A new examination was provided in October 2022.

After a review of all of the evidence of record, lay and medical, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence shows the left knee disability had not more nearly approximated symptoms of moderate left knee instability for a higher 20 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 5257 for the period from June 2, 2020.  

In October 2022, the Veteran received a VA examination for left knee instability.  During the examination, the Veteran reported that he was service connected for both left knee degenerative joint disease and left knee instability.  He asserted worsening of the left knee conditions.  The current symptoms were reported as constant left knee pain that is dull and achy and was aggravated with movement.  The Veteran indicated he takes ibuprofen as needed and had injections in both knees that offered temporary minimal relief.  No flare-ups were reported, but there was functional loss to include worsening pain with running, squatting, kneeling, jumping, or any strenuous activity.  With respect to instability or recurrent subluxation, the Veteran stated that his left knee "feels unstable, like it's going to give out, especially when going down the stairs."  The examiner determined there was no subluxation or persistent instability.  Joint stability testing was performed and anterior instability, posterior instability, medial instability, and lateral instability were all deemed normal.    

The Veteran's representative asserts in the September 2024 Appellate Brief that the Veteran testified about increased symptoms, and the fact that flare-ups are worse and last longer.  This assertion is inconsistent with the Veteran's reporting of symptoms.  For example, during the October 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported that there were no flare-ups.  The Board did not identify any testimony or lay statements during the appeal period that support the representative's contention of flare-ups.  

The VA examiner found no left knee instability during the October 2022 examination.  The Veteran reported that his knee felt unstable, like it is going to give out, particularly when going down the stairs.  The Veteran's lay statements are credible and competent.  See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347 (2018) (holding that objective evidence is not categorically more probative than lay evidence of instability).  Moreover, VA treatment records from April 2022 note that the Veteran reported left knee instability and felt his knees buckle and shake when going down stairs or down a hill.  He also reported that he previously used a brace when engaged in activity, although at the time of the April 2022 medical report, he was not using it because he was not currently very active.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that, for the rating period on appeal from June 2, 2020, the left knee has shown "slight" instability under Diagnostic Code 5257; thus, a rating in excess of 10 percent for the left knee instability is not warranted under the old Diagnostic Code 5257.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a.  A higher rating of 20 percent under Diagnostic Code 5257 for "moderate" left knee instability is not warranted because the Veteran reported knee instability primarily when going down stairs or going down a hill.  In addition, the Veteran only reported occasional use of a brace.  The VA examiner did not identify left knee instability, although acknowledged that the Veteran was previously diagnosed with left knee instability.  Therefore, the evidence shows that symptoms of left knee instability were not more severe than "small in amount."        

The Board will also consider whether a higher rating is warranted under the revised Diagnostic Code 5257.  

Effective February 7, 2021, VA revised the portion of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities that addresses the musculoskeletal system.  The amendments divided Diagnostic Code 5257 into two subsections recurrent subluxation or instability and patellar instability, each with its own criteria. Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76463 (Nov. 30, 2020) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257).

For recurrent subluxation or instability, three ratings are available:

A 10 percent rating is warranted for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. 

A 20 percent is warranted under one of two scenarios: sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation; or unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. 

A 30 percent rating is warranted for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation.

For patellar instability, three ratings are available:

A 10 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. 

A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: a brace, cane, or walker. 

A 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker.

Two Notes accompany the revised Diagnostic Code 5257.  Note 1 states that for patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon.  Note 2 states that a surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration).

The Board also finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent for the left knee instability is not warranted under the revised Diagnostic Code 5257, effective February 7, 2021.  The evidence does not show moderate lateral instability or recurrent subluxation.  As noted above, tests of stability in the left knee were within normal limits during the rating period from June 2, 2020, and the lay and medical evidence does not show recurrent subluxation or dislocation of the knee.  While the evidence demonstrates that there has been a right knee sprain to include an incomplete ligament tear, it was not shown to cause persistent instability.  Additionally, while the evidence also demonstrates a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability, it was not after undergoing surgical repair of one or more of the patellofemoral compartments (i.e., the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and/or the patellar tendon) in the left knee.  Moreover, the Veteran does not require a prescription of any devices for ambulation for patellar instability.  As such, a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted for the left knee instability under the old or revised Diagnostic Code 5257 from June 2, 2020.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  

For these reasons, the Board finds the persuasive weight of the evidence is against increased disability ratings in excess of 10 percent for the service-connected left knee instability during the increased rating period from June 2, 2020; therefore, an increased disability rating must be denied.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
