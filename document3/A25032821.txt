ORDER

The appeal with respect to the validity of a debt in the amount of $7,030.50 for housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33 of Title 38 of the United States Code (Chapter 33 or Post-9/11 GI Bill), is REMANDED. 

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps (USMC) from June 2012 to August 2020.  According to the record, the Veteran has been serving under a new period of active-duty service in the USMC since January 2023. 

The case is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) decision  that addressed the validity and amount of an overpayment of housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33.      

In the May 2023 Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA Form 10182), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The validity of a debt in the amount of $7,030.50 for housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33

The Veteran challenges the validity of a debt resulting from an overpayment of housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33. 

A review of the record shows that on December 4, 2020, Colorado State University certified that for the school term running from January 19, 2021 through May 16, 2021, the Veteran was enrolled for 3 residence credit hours.  The school also certified an overlapping period from January 19, 2021 to May 14, 2021, with the Veteran enrolled for 3 additional resident credit hours and 10 distance credit hours.  Amended enrollments (VA Forms 22-1999) were received on March 23, 2021, only for purposes of establishing the amount of tuition and fees charged for the enrolled courses.  The record does not contain any additional evidence with respect to any changes or amendments for either reductions or withdrawals for the foregoing enrollments.  

In January 2023, the VA's Debt Management Center (DMC) notified Colorado State University that they must return tuition and fees funds in the amount of $7,170.31 paid on behalf of the Veteran.  The notification indicates that the Veteran was not entitled to the benefit and that the school must contact the DMC to obtain information about the term dates in question.  Thereafter, in February 2023, after the issuance of the decision being appealed, the DMC notified the Veteran that he was overpaid for housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33 in the total amount of $7,030.50.  

On May 12, 2023, the Veteran filed the VA Form 10182 specifically challenging a January 10, 2023, VA decision that according to his argument, he was overpaid Chapter 33 benefits for 12 credits.  However, a thorough review of the record shows that the January 10, 2023 decision is not associated with the education file.  Moreover, the record does not contain any notifications from the RO to the Veteran regarding the overpayment in question.  

Additionally, in the VA Form 10182, the Veteran appears to contend that the overpayment occurred during a semester while he was "at sea."   In this regard, the Board notes that in April 2022 the Veteran filed a separate and unrelated application for Chapter 33 benefits (VA Form 22-1990) and described his current service status as on "active duty."  The record does not contain any military service personnel records to confirm or refute his statement.   

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802, the Board may remand for correction of any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 

Additionally, decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record pursuant to applicable statute and regulation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  

Here, there is no indication in the record that the AOJ explained to the Veteran how the overpayment was created, or whether the Veteran partially reduced or fully withdrew his enrollment.  In either case, the record neither indicates the effective date of discontinuance of benefits.  It is not evident from the record how the AOJ determined the Veteran's overpayment of housing allowance benefits for that term, to include whether the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(n) for reduction or termination due to active-duty status, as suggested by the Veteran's statement in his May 2023 NOD, are applicable to the facts of his case.  The regulation provides that the discontinuance date for housing allowance benefits for an eligible individual who reduces or terminates training as a result of being called or ordered to serve on active duty under specific legal authorities, will occur at the end of the month during which the reduction or withdrawal occurred.  Additionally, the Board cannot discern the effective date of reduction or withdrawal to determine whether the one-time 6-credit hour exclusion as set forth by 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(b) was considered in the decision.   The regulation provides that "in the first instance of a withdrawal from a course or courses for which the eligible individual received educational assistance, VA will consider mitigating circumstances to exist with respect to the withdrawal of a course or courses totaling no more than six semester hours or the equivalent."  The regulation further provides that "[i]f mitigating circumstances are considered to exist in accordance with this paragraph, VA will terminate or reduce educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the withdrawal occurred." 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(b).  

In that regard, the Board points out that first, the Veteran's statement suggests a call to active duty "at sea" for the school term in question, and second, that the Veteran's education file does not contain evidence of prior instances of withdrawal after a drop/add period.  Therefore, the above-mentioned provisions are of potential applicability to the facts of this case.  However, there is no payment history for housing allowance benefits nor letters addressed to the Veteran explaining the details on how the debt and its amount were determined.  The record only contains, as explained above, post-decisional evidence comprised of DMC letters sent directly to Colorado State University indicating that the tuition and fees payment had been sent directly to the school and that the school was requested to return the funds in the amount of $7,170.34, and to the Veteran indicating that he was overpaid housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33 in the total amount of $7,030.50.  

Unfortunately, the record does not contain sufficient information for the Board to determine when any housing allowance payments were made to the Veteran; whether the Veteran partially reduced or fully withdrew his enrollment and, if so, the effective date of such reduction or withdrawal.  The Board can neither determine at this point whether the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(b) or (n) apply to the facts of this case.  In summary, the Board cannot determine whether the debt resulting from the overpayment of housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33 was validly created.  Moreover, without knowing the effective date determined by the AOJ to discontinue the Veteran's award, the Board cannot determine what portion, if any, of the debt could be considered as validly created.  The AOJ's failure to provide the Veteran with notice of his debt and/or to make such notice available for review by the Board, to include providing the Board with the evidence/information relied upon to determine that the Veteran had been overpaid tuition and fees in the amount of $7,030.50, warrants a remand in this case. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.801, 20.802.   

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Send the Veteran a letter explaining, in detail, how the debt resulting from the overpayment of housing allowance benefits was calculated, to include consideration of the fact that the Veteran expressed he was "at sea" during the school period in question.  All amounts paid to the Veteran during the relevant time period, to include the dates on which those payments were made, should be listed. 

(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)

2.  The letter should also include an explanation of the provisions set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(b) and (n) and whether these are of applicability to the facts of the Veteran's case, to include the effective date the AOJ determined to reduce the housing allowance assistance.
