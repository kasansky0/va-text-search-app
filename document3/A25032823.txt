REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1975 to May 1979.  He also had subsequent active duty for training (ADT) and inactive duty for training (IDT) in the Reserve from July 1984 to November 1986.  

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) review system.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in September 2023.  The September 2023 decision was a supplemental review decision that readjudicated the claims of service connection for hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, on the merits, and denied the claims.  The Veteran appealed that decision by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in August 2024.  He elected the Direct Review docket.  

In August 2024, along with his VA Form 10182, the Veteran submitted a statement detailing his various contentions with respect to all claims on appeal.  While primarily comprised of argument, this statement also included new lay evidence.  The Veteran also submitted copies of records that were previously before the AOJ at the time of the decision on appeal.  

In Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that new evidence submitted with a VA Form 10182 on which the Direct Review option is selected creates uncertainty as to which Board review option the claimant intended, triggering the Board's duty to seek clarification under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (f).  The Court reasoned, in-part, that consideration must be given to the "full context within which [Veterans'] submissions are made" including liberally construing the filings of pro se claimants.  Id.  (citing Rivera v. Shinseki, 654 F.3d 1377, 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011)).

On September 9, 2024, the Board provided notice to the Veteran that the evidence in question could not be considered.  He was also advised that if he wanted the Board to consider any additional evidence for the issues listed on his VA Form 10182, he must change his Board appeal request by switching AMA dockets (to Evidence Submission or Hearing), as explained in the correspondence, and that, if his request was approved, he would then have the opportunity to submit any additional evidence he wants the Board to consider.  No response to this letter was received.  The Board will proceed utilizing the Veteran's original Direct Review docket selection.

Consequently, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding all claims on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c) (2) (ii).

Entitlement to Service Connection for Hypertension, Diabetes, and Chronic Kidney Disease

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f) (2) (A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).  The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

In written statements of record, the Veteran asserts that his hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease are due to in-service exposure to hazardous chemical agents, to include herbicide agents and/or nerve gas while assigned to "active duty" on Johnston Atoll in May 1985.  See October 2022 and June 2023 statements.  The Veteran provided detailed allegations about the length of time he was there, his proximity to chemical bunkers during a construction project, and the fact that he was given instructions on how to use a gas mask and how to use a "Mark 1 Kit / Pralidoxime Autoinjector (2-PAM)."  He recalled smelling a chemical odor coming from the bunkers, and being told there were hazardous chemicals stored on the Atoll.

Service personnel records reflect the Veteran served on Johnston Island from May 19, 1985 to June 1, 1985, a period characterized as "Acdutra."  See Abstract of Service and Medical History.  Moreover, the Veteran's service treatment records document that he was seen in May 1985 for complaints of a rash that started after his arrival on Johnston Island; and that he was later examined in May 1985 and found fit for release from "2 weeks acdutra."   

In a June 2023 VA Memorandum, the AOJ determined the Veteran participated in toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) and had non-deployment related TERA exposure consistent with the circumstances of his service, to include Navy Rate CE Construction Electrician; DD214 dated 7/11/1979; exposure to asbestos, industrial solvents, industrial adhesives, benzene, trichloroethylene, and paint fumes.  

VA medical opinions were obtained in September 2023 to address the etiology of the Veteran's hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.  However, such opinions were based on knowledge of only the exposures identified in the June 2023 VA Memorandum.  

There was, however, no attempt by the AOJ to verify the Veteran's reported exposure to hazardous chemical agents, to include herbicide agents and/or nerve gas, during a period of ADT, on Johnston Atoll from May 19, 1985 to June 1, 1985, prior to the AOJ decision on appeal.

The Board acknowledges that 38 U.S.C. § 1116 (d) (5) provides that service on Johnston Atoll during the period beginning on January 1, 1972 and ending on September 30, 1977, is covered service for which entitlement to service connection is presumed for certain listed diseases, including hypertension and diabetes.  There is no evidence that the Veteran served on Johnston Atoll during the presumptive period, or that his service on Johnston Atoll from May 19, 1985 to June 1, 1985, was during a period of active duty.  Regardless, service connection may be established with proof of direct causation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d); Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994).   

As part of VA's duty to assist, VA is required to make efforts to obtain relevant records pertaining to the claimant's service that are held or maintained by a governmental entity.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c) (3).  The evidence before the AOJ at the time of the decision on appeal was sufficient to warrant further inquiry to attempt to verify the Veteran's claimed chemical exposure and thus a remand for this pre-decisional duty to assist error is warranted.

Additionally, in October 2022, the Veteran reported that he had received VA treatment since October 1989 at the Palestine, Texas VA Clinic, which is associated with the Central-Texas VA Medical Center (VAMC).  The evidence includes Central-Texas VAMC records dating to November 2020.  The record does not appear to include all VAMC Central-Texas records prior to November 2020 as identified by the Veteran.  VA treatment records further indicate that the Veteran has received nephropathy care from a non-VA provider through VA's community care program.  See March 2022 Community Care Coordination Plan.  Accordingly, all Central-Texas VAMC records for the Veteran prior to November 2020, as well as all records of nephropathy care the Veteran has received through VA's community care program, must be obtained to comply with a duty to assist error preceding the AOJ decision on appeal.  Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786, 793 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (VA must obtain all sufficiently identified VA treatment records regardless of their relevance).

Consequently, the Board finds that the reliance on inadequate VA medical opinions, which appear to have been based on an incomplete record, was a pre-decisional duty to assist error that warrants a remand for new opinions.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f) (2) (A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain and associate with the record copies of:

"	All Central-Texas VAMC treatment records for the Veteran prior to November 2020

"	All records of non-VA treatment received through VA's Community Care program  

If copies of these records cannot be obtained, the AOJ must detail its attempts to obtain the copies and state why it could not be obtained.  

2. Then, attempt to verify whether the Veteran had in-service exposure to hazardous chemical agents, to include herbicide agents and/or nerve gas during a period of service characterized as ADT, on Johnston Atoll, from May 19, 1985 to June 1, 1985, to include submitting a request to the appropriate records repository.

?

3. Then, obtain VA medical opinions by an appropriate physician to determine the etiology of the Veteran's hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.  The Veteran's claims file must be made available to the examiner, and the examiner must specify in the medical opinion that the file has been reviewed.

The examiner must provide opinions as to whether it is at least as likely as not (ie., the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's hypertension, diabetes, and/or chronic kidney disease, is/are related to his reported exposure to hazardous chemical agents, to include herbicide agent exposure and/or nerve gas, at Johnston Atoll, from May 19, 1985 to June 1, 1985. 

In providing the requested opinions, the examiner must consider and address the Veteran's October 2022 and June 2023 statements wherein he reported:

"	exposure to hazardous chemical agents, to include herbicide agents and/or nerve gas during his service on Johnston Atoll in May 1985; 

"	his proximity to chemical bunkers during a construction project; 

"	that he was given instructions on how to use a gas mask and how to use a "Mark 1 Kit / Pralidoxime Autoinjector (2-PAM);" 

"	that he recalled smelling a chemical odor coming from the bunkers, and being told there were hazardous chemicals stored on the Atoll

NOTE: The examiner shall consider the total potential exposure through all applicable TERAs of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.
