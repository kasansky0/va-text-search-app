ORDER

The appeal of the identification of a duty to assist error during the higher-level review for major depression is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The June 2024 rating decision, which identified a duty to assist error during the higher-level review of the Veteran's claim for service connection for major depression, did not constitute a final, appealable decision as to that claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the identification of a duty to assist error during the higher-level review for major depression are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500; Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from September 1984 to September 1994, and from October 1998 to October 2008.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In September 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) and requested direct review by the Board.  Ordinarily, pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), the Board would not be able to adjudicate this appeal before the deadline elapsed for requesting a docket switch, which is the later of one year from the date the RO mailed notice of the appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives the VA Form 10182.  Here, the later date would be June 2025 - one year from issuance of the June 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, as discussed below, given that this is a purely procedural dismissal, and a docket switch would not cure the procedural defect in this matter, the Board finds that delaying the dismissal until that time is not necessary.  Therefore, the Board will continue to review this matter under the direct review docket.

Preliminary Matter

The Board notes that the Veteran attempted to appeal a March 2015 legacy rating decision in her September 2024 VA Form 10182.  In the March 2015 rating decision, the RO denied the Veteran's original claim for service connection for major depression.  Notably, the Board did not docket the appeal stemming from the March 2015 rating decision when processing the Veteran's September 2024 VA Form 10182 on intake.  The Board acknowledges that a VA Form 10182 may be accepted in lieu of a legacy Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).  However, in this case, the Board does not accept the Veteran's September 2024 VA Form 10182 in lieu of a legacy NOD of the March 2015 rating decision.  Under the legacy system, the claimant has one year from notification of a RO decision to initiate an appeal by filing a NOD with the decision, and the decision becomes final if an appeal is not perfected within the allowed time.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d)(1), 19.52, 20.1103.  Time limits for filing a NOD may be extended for good cause shown.  38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).  

Here, the September 2024 VA Form 10182 was filed more than 9 years after notification of the March 2015 rating decision, and neither the Veteran nor her representative requested a filing extension for good cause.  Thus, to the extent the Veteran argues that the September 2024 VA Form 10182 should be accepted in lieu of a legacy NOD regarding the March 2015 rating decision, the Board rejects this argument because the September 2024 VA Form 10182 is untimely, and no good cause for extending the time for filing has been shown.  Accordingly, the attempted appeal of the issue of service connection for major depression, stemming from the March 2015 legacy rating decision, will remain undocketed.

1. The appeal of the identification of a duty to assist error during the higher-level review for major depression

An appeal may be initiated only once a decision is made by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Actions by the AOJ to defer a decision are not appealable decisions.  See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011) ("Because there is no 'final decision' when the RO issues a deferred rating decision, there has been no 'adjudicative determination' from which [a] [Notice of Disagreement] can be filed.").  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).  

In the June 2024 rating decision, the RO identified a duty to assist error during the higher-level review of the major depression claim and noted that further development would be undertaken.  This rating decision, which only advised the Veteran of future action to be taken by the RO, is not a final, appealable decision as to the claim for service connection for major depression.  Therefore, it was an administrative error for the Board to accept the September 2024 VA Form 10182 as to the June 2024 rating decision.  Accordingly, the attempted appeal of the identification of a duty to assist error during the higher-level review for major depression must be dismissed as a matter of law.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500; Shipley, 24 Vet. App. at 462.

(Continued on the next page)

As an aside, the Board observes that the RO subsequently adjudicated the Veteran's claim for service connection for "adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, chronic" in rating decisions dated October 2024 and February 2025.  The timeframe for appeal of these decisions has not yet elapsed.  Thus, the Board notes that the Veteran may still properly appeal either decision, should she desire to do so.
