ORDER

Entitlement to revision of the January 1996 rating decision, in which an initial noncompensable (0 percent) rating was assigned for bilateral temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome, status/post (s/p) surgery, on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), is denied.

Entitlement to revision of the January 1996 rating decision, based on the allegation that the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) failed to assign a rating for residual scar on left side of face, on the basis of CUE, is denied.

Entitlement to revision of the January 1996 rating decision, based on the allegation that the AOJ failed to assign a rating for painful scar on left side of face, on the basis of CUE, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Pertaining to the assignment of a noncompensable rating for bilateral TMJ syndrome, the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were before the adjudicators, and statutory and regulation provisions extant at the time were correctly applied; to the extent that there was any error in the January 1996 rating decision, it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued if the error had not been made.

2. Pertaining to the allegation that the AOJ failed to assign a rating for facial scar, the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were before the adjudicators, and statutory and regulation provisions extant at the time were correctly applied; to the extent that there was any error in the January 1996 rating decision, it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued if the error had not been made.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to revision of the January 1996 rating decision, in which an initial noncompensable rating was assigned for bilateral TMJ syndrome, s/p surgery, on the basis of CUE, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A, 7105 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (2024).

2. The criteria for entitlement to revision of the January 1996 rating decision, based on the allegation that the AOJ failed to assign a rating for residual scar on left side of face, on the basis of CUE, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A, 7105 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (2024).

3. The criteria for entitlement to revision of the January 1996 rating decision, based on the allegation that the AOJ failed to assign a rating for painful scar on left side of face, on the basis of CUE, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A, 7105 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1990 to December 1994. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sincerely thanks the Veteran for her service.

This appeal to the Board arose from a November 2022 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claim file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board reminds that new evidence cannot be considered in deciding the claims seeking revision or reversal of prior final decisions based on CUE, as such CUE claims must be based upon the facts and law that existed at the time of the prior decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(iii).

1. Entitlement to revision of the January 1996 rating decision, in which an initial noncompensable rating was assigned for bilateral TMJ syndrome, s/p surgery, on the basis of CUE.

2. Entitlement to revision of the January 1996 rating decision, based on the allegation that the AOJ failed to assign a rating for residual scar on left side of face, on the basis of CUE.

3. Entitlement to revision of the January 1996 rating decision, based on the allegation that the AOJ failed to assign a rating for painful scar on left side of face, on the basis of CUE.

CUE is a very specific and rare kind of error. It is the kind of error of fact or law that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion to which reasonable minds could not differ that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Even where the premise of error is accepted, if it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensured, the error complained of cannot be CUE. Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993).

There is a three-part test to determine whether a prior decision was based on CUE: (1) either the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before the adjudicator (i.e., more than a simple disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated) or the statutory or regulatory provisions extant at that time were incorrectly applied; (2) the error must be undebatable and of the sort which, had it not been made, would have manifestly changed the outcome at the time it was made; and (3) a determination that there was CUE must be made on the record and law that existed at the time of the prior adjudication in question. See Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992) (en banc).

A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset. King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014). The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different. Id. at 442.

In this matter, the Veteran asserts that the AOJ committed CUE when it did not assign a compensable rating for bilateral TMJ syndrome. The Veteran asserts that the evidence at the time of the January 1996 rating decision showed that she experienced painful motion. Additionally, the Veteran contends that the AOJ committed CUE when it failed to assign a rating for scar on the left side of the face. 

The Board notes that in the April 2021 and May 2021 rating decision, the AOJ awarded a 30 percent rating for bilateral TMJ syndrome, a 10 percent rating for painful scar on left side of face under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7804, and a noncompensable rating under DC 7800. These awards are effective from March 12, 2021. Essentially, the Veteran is seeking earlier effective dates of these awards based on CUE in the January 1996 rating decision.

Turning now to the evidence extant at the time of the January 1996 rating decision, in December 1994, the Veteran filed a claim seeking entitlement to service connection for multiple disabilities, including TMJ. See December 1994 VA Form 21-526 (Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension).

The service treatment records document the treatment of bilateral TMJ syndrome. In April 1994, it was noted that the Veteran was referred for TMJ examination and consultation. She reported dull, intermittent, and constant pain over the right TMJ. Pain radiated to right temporal region. In May 1993, the Veteran underwent an arthroscopy. Prior to the surgery, it was reported that the Veteran was only able to open her mouth about 20mm with popping on one side. She was instructed about TMJ range of motion (ROM) exercises. She demonstrated the exercises without difficulty. The Veteran underwent physical therapy after surgery. After surgery, it was reported that the Veteran was doing well. The ROM was reported to be 15 to 20 mm. She reported some soreness when opening her mouth and had tried two of the exercises. In a subsequent visit, she was doing well, eating without any problems. ROM was noted to be 30 mm. She was encouraged to continue the exercises. It was assessed that the goals were achieved.

In August 1993, the Veteran endorsed jaw popping and pain. In November 1993, pain was reported pertaining to TMJ. She complained of the inability to open her mouth without pain. In February 1994, the Veteran underwent a left TMJ arthrotomy under general anesthesia. Postoperative condition was noted to be good.  The Veteran underwent physical therapy pertaining to her TMJ.  In a February 1994 physical therapy record, it was reported that the Veteran experienced soreness with chewing and opening. Mouth opening was two finger widths, 2.5 cm. There was crepitation, present on the left more than right, with opening and closing. Some left frontal paralysis was reported as residual of the surgery. In a later note, it was reported that goals were met and she demonstrated functional forehead and facial movements. It was also noted that the post operative examination was within normal limits. In October 1994, the sutures from the surgery were removed. A surgical wound was noted and closed. 

In the January 1996 rating decision, the AOJ awarded entitlement to service connection for bilateral temporomandibular syndrome, s/p surgery. The AOJ stated that the service medical records showed that the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral TMJ syndrome in service and noted the surgical treatments. The AOJ stated that there was no evidence of significant problems subsequent to the second surgery. The AOJ noted that the evidence did not support a compensable rating at that time. It assigned a 0 percent rating from December 11, 1994, explaining that a noncompensable rating was granted unless the record showed limited inter-incisal movement between 31 and 40 mm, or lateral excursion between 0 and 4 mm. See January 1996 Rating Decision.

Now, the Board turns to the pertinent laws and regulations extant at the time of the January 1996 rating. In this matter, those laws and regulations concern the evaluation of dental and oral conditions, and scars.

The Veteran's TMJ condition is evaluated under DC 9905, which rates limited motion of TMJ articulation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.150. In 1996, the rating criteria read that a 10 percent rating was warranted for range of lateral excursion 0 to 4mm or inter-incisal range 31 to 40 mm. A 20 percent rating was warranted for inter-incisal range 20 to 30 mm. A 30 percent rating is warranted for inter-incisal range 11 to 20 mm. The maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for inter-incisal range 0 to 10 mm. Note to DC 9905 directed that ratings for limited inter-incisal movement shall not be combined with ratings for limited lateral excursion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.150. 

38 C.F.R. § 4.118 concerns the evaluation of skin conditions, such as scars. In 1996, under DC 7800 (scars disfiguring face, head, face, or neck), a 10 percent rating was warranted for moderate disfiguring. Slight disfiguring was assigned a noncompensable rating. DC 7804 evaluated superficial, tender and painful scars on objective demonstration. The maximum rating of 10 percent would be assigned. Note to DC 7804 stated that a 10 percent rating will be assigned, when the requirements are met, even though the location may be on the tip of finger or toe, and the rating may exceed the amputation value for limited movement. 

After a thorough consideration of the evidence extant at the time of the January 1996 rating decision, the Board finds that the AOJ did not commit CUE when it assigned a noncompensable rating under DC 9905 for bilateral TMJ syndrome, and when it did not assign ratings for scars.

First, the Board will address the rating for bilateral TMJ syndrome.  The Veteran asserts that the evidence at the time showed that she was experiencing painful motion of the jaw. The only medical evidence present at the time were the service treatment records, detailing the complaints, surgical treatment, and recovery for the TMJ condition. After the second surgery and the physical therapy, there does not seem to be any notations pertaining to constantly experiencing either limited motion or painful motion of the jaw. The Board notes that prior to the surgical treatments, it was recorded that the Veteran experienced limited motion of her jaw that could warrant a compensable rating based on the regulations. However, after the surgery, specifically the February 1994 surgery, the record indicated improvement in the ROM. It was noted that goals were met pertaining to movement and function. There is evidence indicating normal ROM without any pain. The record at the time is not definitive towards showing entitlement to a compensable rating for TMJ based on limited or painful motion.

The Board is cognizant of the regulations and case law, such as § 4.59 and DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995), concerning the consideration of painful motion when contemplating the assignment of a compensable rating for disabilities evaluated based on limited range of motion. However, again, the evidence indicates that after surgical treatment in February 1994, the Veteran experienced normal ROM without pain. A review of the record does not show complaints of jaw pain while opening mouth after goals were met in physical therapy. So, while there was evidence in the service treatment records indicating painful and limited motion at one point, there was evidence indicating improved or normal ROM without pain at another point. The evidence did not only and exclusively support a compensable rating for painful motion.

The argument is essentially a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated by the adjudicator. However, "[i]t is the prerogative of the factfinder . . . to interpret the evidence and draw reasonable inferences from it." Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 187 (citing Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 52 (1990)). A disagreement as to how the facts were weighed does not support a finding of CUE. Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 43-44.

Pertaining to the AOJ not assigning ratings for scars, the Board does not dispute the presence of a surgical scar at the time of the January 1996 rating decision. The evidence shows that the Veteran underwent two surgeries and that she had sutures removed in October 1994. However, the evidence at the time does not specify the characteristics of the scar. The scar was not reported or described to be painful, tender, or superficial, which would warrant a 10 percent rating under DC 7804. There was not anything indicating that the scar caused disfigurement warranting a compensable, or noncompensable, rating under DC 7800. There were no descriptions indicating a slight disfigurement of the face. Therefore, the AOJ's lack of acknowledgment of the presence of the scar was not outcome determinative, as the evidence at the time does not unilaterally support an assignment of a rating for a scar under the governing regulations at the time. 

Again, to be CUE, the evidence has to clearly show that it is undebatable that the outcome would have been different but for the error. See King, supra. Since there is evidence to support the AOJ's determination, the rating decision, by law, cannot be considered a clear and undebatable error.

The Board is truly sympathetic to the Veteran's claim. However, as CUE was not committed in the January 1996 rating decision pertaining to the assignment of noncompensable rating for bilateral TMJ syndrome, and not assigning ratings for scar on the left side of the face, entitlement to revision of the decision must be denied.
