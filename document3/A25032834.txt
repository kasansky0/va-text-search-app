REMANDED

Service connection for prostate cancer residuals is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from July 1997 to July 2001 in the United States Marine Corps (USMC), and from November 2001 to August 2002 in the Air Force Air National Guard of the United States (Air Force - ANGUS).

In the September 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in an August 2023 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  As the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The issue of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the July 2023 rating decision on appeal.  

The Veteran seeks service connection for prostate cancer.  He claims his prostate cancer is the result of in-service exposure to diesel and/or jet fuels.  The Veteran's DD Form 214 reflects that his military occupational specialty (MOS) in the USMC was aviation ordinance system technician, and in the Air Force - ANGUS was aircraft armament systems apprentice.  

In January 2023, the Veteran filed an initial claim of service connection for prostate cancer.  He asserted that he was exposed to various toxic chemicals working around aviation ordinance such as torpedoes, missiles, bombs, rockets, ammo, and other chemicals associated with aircraft and aircraft ordinance.  

A February 2023 VA Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum reflects that the Veteran was exposed to TERA and referenced a June 2021 Motor Vehicles Operators physical exam.  See 02/16/2023 VA Memo; see also 06/03/2021 Military Personnel Record.  

The Board notes that the Motor Vehicles Operators physical exam was conducted in August 1998; June 2021 is the date of the entry.  The TERA memo does not reference any in-service exposure associated with aircrafts and aviation.  

In March 2023, the Veteran underwent a C&P examination.  The examiner proffered a negative etiological opinion.  The examiner acknowledged that the Veteran was diagnosed in 2020 with prostate cancer.  Regarding toxic exposure, he notes exposure to various jet fuels and ammunitions.  However, his February 2023 TERA memo notes no known exposure to any substance known to cause prostate cancer.  Therefore, his prostate cancer was not caused by any toxic exposure.  

In formulating the negative etiological opinion, the examiner relied on the TERA memo which only references a Motor Vehicles Operators exam.  The TERA memo does not reference or acknowledge the Veteran's MOS during his periods of service, and the examiner did not consider his claimed in-service exposures in formulating an opinion.  Thus, remand is therefore necessary to obtain an etiological opinion regarding the Veteran's claimed in-service exposures.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request that a clinician with appropriate expertise review the claims folder and provide an opinion regarding the following:

Is prostate cancer at least as likely as not (likelihood at least approximately balanced or equal) due to the Veteran's active service or is it otherwise causally related to any event or circumstance of his service, including in-service exposures to various toxic chemicals working around aviation ordinance such as torpedoes, missiles, bombs, rockets, ammo, and other chemicals associated with aircraft and aircraft ordinance?

Provide a comprehensive rationale for the opinion.  All pertinent evidence, including both lay and medical, should be considered.  The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such reports must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating the opinion.
