FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On May 17, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, seeking service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability (the "May 2022 Claim").

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the November 2023 Rating Decision have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 fee decision (the "February 2024 Fee Decision") issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which constitutes an initial decision on the issue of attorney fees; therefore, the modernized review system, governed by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In March 2024, the Appellant timely filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (the "March 2024 NOD") in response to the February 2024 Fee Decision on appeal and elected the Direct Review docket.  In April 2024, the Veteran was provided with a redacted copy of the Appellant's March 2024 NOD pursuant to contested claims procedures (the "April 2024 Notice"); however, the Veteran has not filed a response to the March 2024 NOD or elected to change the docket.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403, 20.404.  Therefore, this contested claim remains on the Direct Review docket, and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 Fee Decision on appeal and a brief or argument filed by the Veteran within thirty (30) days of the April 2024 Notice.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405.  

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.

ATTORNEY FEES 

Eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran pursuant to the November 2023 Rating Decision is denied. 

The Appellant asserts, without elaborating, that the direct payment of fees is warranted based upon the November 2023 Rating Decision granting a TDIU based in part on a service-connected acquired psychiatric disability, effective May 17, 2022.

However, after careful review, and for the reasons set forth below, the Board disagrees and finds that the Appellant is not eligible for the direct payment of fees based on past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran pursuant to the November 2023 Rating Decision, as the Appellant did not submit a qualifying request for review on behalf of the Veteran.  Therefore, the claim is denied.

VA claimants are permitted to appoint an attorney or agent as representatives in connection with the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904.  In order to appoint an attorney or agent as his or her representative, the claimant must submit a validly executed VA Form 21-22a, Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative, which must meet the following requirements: (1) the form must be signed by (a) the claimant; (b) the claimant's guardian; or (c) in the case of an incompetent, minor, or otherwise incapacitated person without a guardian, the claimant's spouse, parent, other relative or friend (if interests are not adverse), or the director of the hospital in which the claimant is maintained; (2) the form must be signed by the attorney or agent providing representation; and (3) the form must be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the claims file.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a). 

The claimant may revoke a power of attorney and discharge an agent or attorney at any time, and, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the receipt of a new VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a executed by the claimant and the representative shall constitute revocation of an existing power of attorney.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1).

In order to be valid, all fee agreements between a claimant and an attorney or agent must be in writing, signed by both the claimant and the representative, and must include the following: (1) the name of the veteran; (2) if other than the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant; (3) the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the veteran, claimant, or appellant; (4) the applicable VA file number; and (5) the specific criteria for determining the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).

Fee agreements must also clearly specify whether VA shall pay the attorney or agent directly out of past-due benefits ("direct-pay fee agreement").   See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g)(2).  A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to directly pay the attorney or agent out of past-due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the attorney or agent is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA.  See id.   A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within thirty (30) days of its execution.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g)(3).  

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of attorneys or agents with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1); see also Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28, 32-34 (2023).

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the attorney or agent (i) is to be paid to the attorney or agent by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(1), (2).  Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be reasonable if the representation continued through the date of the decision awarding benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f)(1).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by the AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  Attorney or agent fees may be calculated based on the total amount of past-due benefits awarded to the veteran regardless of the amount actually paid to the veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020).

Where the benefit granted on appeal or as the result of the readjudicated claim involves service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  See id.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the attorney or agent represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the attorney or agent will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Appellant began serving as the Veteran's duly appointed representative in April 2023, when the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22a appointing the Appellant as representative, and the parties executed the April 2023 Fee Agreement providing that the Appellant would be entitled to the direct payment of fees in the amount of 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded by VA.  As the record reflects that the April 2023 VA Form 21-22a and Fee Agreement comply with the applicable VA regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that both are valid for purposes of the award of fees.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.627, 14.631, 14.636. 

In addition, the Board finds that the required contested claims procedures have been completed, as, in April 2024, the Veteran was provided a copy of the Appellant's redacted March 2024 NOD, and in June 2024, both the Veteran and the Appellant were provided additional notice that the March 2024 NOD was placed on the Board's direct review docket.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403, 20.404.

Regarding the initial decision with respect to the case, the Board finds that the June 2023 Rating Decision constitutes the initial decision on the issue of an increased rating claim for the service-connected acquired psychiatric disability and a TDIU, and further finds the Appellant did not submit a request for review of that initial decision, for the following reasons: (1) on May 17, 2022, the Veteran submitted the May 2022 Claim seeking service connection for the acquired psychiatric disability; (2) the July 2022 Rating Decision denied the May 2022 Claim; (3) in May 2023, the Appellant submitted the May 2023 Supplemental Claim on behalf of the Veteran seeking review of the July 2022 Rating Decision, including service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability; (4) the June 2023 Rating Decision granted service connection for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability and assigned a 70 percent disability rating, effective May 17, 2022; (5) in July 2023, the Veteran submitted the July 2023 Claim seeking an increased rating for his service-connected psychiatric disability; (6) in August 2023, the Veteran submitted the August 2023 TDIU Claim seeking a TDIU on the grounds that his service-connected acquired psychiatric disability, among other disabilities, renders him unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment; (7) the Appellant did not submit a qualifying request for review of the June 2023 Rating Decision on behalf of the Veteran; and (8) thereafter, in the November 2023 Rating Decision, the Veteran was awarded a TDIU based in part on the service-connected acquired psychiatric disability, effective May 17, 2022, the date of the Veteran's original service connection claim for an acquired psychiatric disability.

Regarding the nature of the services provided by the Appellant, as noted above, the Appellant did not submit a request for review of the June 2023 Rating Decision, such as a supplemental claim or request for higher level review.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.  Instead, the Veteran submitted the subsequent claims that led to the November 2023 Rating Decision granting a TDIU. 

Therefore, the Board finds that the February 2024 Fee Decision properly denied the Appellant attorney fees based on the November 2023 Rating Decision, as the issuance of the November 2023 Rating Decision granting a TDIU was prompted by the Veteran's own request for review of the June 2023 Rating Decision and not the Appellant's representation of the Veteran.

Accordingly, in light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria have not been met for the Appellant's eligibility for direct payment of attorney fees of 20 percent of the past-due benefits paid to the Veteran pursuant to the November 2023 Rating Decision, and the appeal is denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904.
