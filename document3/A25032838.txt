ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2020, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2020, for the grant of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On October 23, 2020, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) received the Veteran's formal claim for increased ratings for migraines and a right hip disability in which the Veteran reported that he was totally disabled.

2. On  November 9, 2020, a VA RO received the Veteran's formal claim for entitlement to TDIU.

3. In a November 2020 rating decision, the VA RO granted TDIU effective May 16, 2020, and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance effective May 16, 2020.

4. In a February 2022 rating decision, the VA RO found clear and unmistakable errors in the November 2020 rating decision.  The RO assigned a new effective date of August 1, 2020, for the grant of TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance.

5. The evidence persuasively shows that the claim received on October 23, 2020, is a claim for TDIU.

6. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that prior to October 23, 2020, there was formal claim for TDIU or intent to file a claim for compensation presented that later was associated with a formal claim for TDIU.

7. From October 23, 2019, to May 14, 2020, the Veteran was service connected for obstructive sleep apnea, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with traumatic brain injury, bilateral pes planus, multiple subcutaneous nodules, a left hip disability, a right hip disability, a right knee disability, a right knee surgical scar, a deviated septum, and migraines.  

8. From October 23, 2019, to January 31, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 100 percent disabling.

9. From February 1, 2020, to May 14, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 90 percent disabling with both the obstructive sleep apnea and PTSD being rated 50 percent disabling.

10. From May 15, 2020, to May 17, 2020, the Veteran was service connected for obstructive sleep apnea, PTSD with traumatic brain injury, bilateral pes planus, multiple subcutaneous nodules, a left hip disability, a right hip disability, a right knee disability, a right knee surgical scar, a deviated septum, migraines, and a right hip scar.

11. From May 15, 2020, to May 17, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 100 percent disabling and special monthly compensation based on housebound status was granted for that time period.

12. From May 18, 2020, to July 31, 2020, the Veteran was service connected for obstructive sleep apnea, PTSD with traumatic brain injury, bilateral pes planus, multiple subcutaneous nodules, a left hip disability, a right hip disability, a right knee disability, a right knee surgical scar, a deviated septum, migraines, a right hip scar, and temporomandibular joint disorder with bruxism.

13. From May 18, 2020, to July 31, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 100 percent disabling and special monthly compensation based on housebound status was granted for that time period.

14.  The evidence persuasively shows that during the one-year period prior to the October 23, 2020, TDIU claim, it is factual ascertainable that the service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable from performing all forms of substantially gainful employment that are consistent with his education and occupational experience.

15. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that prior to May 16, 2020, the service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable from performing all forms of substantially gainful employment that are consistent with his education and occupational experience.

16. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that prior to August 1, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were permanent and total. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to August 1, 2020, for the grant of TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 5101, 5107, 5110 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.151, 3.155, 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.16, 4.19 (2025).

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to August 1, 2020, for the grant of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 3500, 3501(a)(1), 5101, 5107, 5110 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.151, 3.155, 3.400, 3.807, 21.3021 (2025).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from November 1995 to December 2003.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2020 rating decision of a VA RO.  

In the November 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301 (2025).  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801 (2025). 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (2025).  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

In the November 2020 rating decision, the RO granted TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance.  The RO assigned an effective date of May 16, 2020, for both benefits.  In a February 2022 rating decision, the VA RO found clear and unmistakable errors in the November 2020 rating decision.  The RO assigned a new effective date of August 1, 2020, for the grant of TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance.  The Veteran did not appeal the February 2022 rating decision.  As such, the Board will consider whether an effective date earlier than August 1, 2020, is warranted for TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance.  

An October 2021 report of general information reflects that the Veteran called and indicated that he would like to remove TDIU from his award because he was going back to work.  A November 2021 VA email shows that the Veteran wanted to withdraw his TDIU.  In a December 2022 rating decision, the RO discontinued TDIU effective December 1, 2022, and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance effective December 1, 2022.  There is no indication that the Veteran wants to withdraw the claims of an effective date earlier than August 1, 2020, for TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance.  Thus, the Board will proceed with the appeal.

In November 2021, the RO certified the Veteran's appeal to the Board.  In March 2022, the Veteran's counsel filed a notice of withdrawing representation.  In February 2025, the Board denied the Veteran's counsel's motion to withdraw as the Veteran's representative.  Accordingly, the counsel remains the Veteran's representative.

VA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits are found at 38 U.S.C. §§ 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 and 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a). 

The Veteran and his counsel have not raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.  Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to duty to assist argument).

Earlier Effective Date

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2020, for the grant of TDIU

Governing law and regulations

TDUI may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation without regard to advancing age as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

For a veteran to prevail on a claim for a total compensation rating based on individual unemployability, the record must reflect some factor, which takes this case outside the norm.  The simple fact that a claimant is currently unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough.  A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment, but the ultimate question is whether a veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993) (A high rating is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment.).

Age cannot be considered as a factor in evaluating a service-connected disability.  Unemployability associated with advancing age or intercurrent disability cannot be used as a basis for a total disability rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.19.

In Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) held that, although no additional disability compensation may be paid when a total schedular disability rating is already in effect, a separate award of TDIU predicated on a single disability may form the basis for an award of special monthly compensation based on housebound status. 

A TDIU claim is a claim for increased compensation, and the effective date rules for increased compensation apply to a TDIU claim.  See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim shall be fixed in accordance with facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The implementing VA regulation provides that the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim filed over a year after active service will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For an increased rating claim, the effective date is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within one year of such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim.  When medical records indicate an increase in disability, receipt of such medical records may be used to establish an effective date for retroactive benefits based on facts found of an increase in disability only if a completed claim or intent to file a claim for an increase is received within one year of the date of the report of examination, hospitalization, or medical treatment.  The provisions of this paragraph only when such reports relate to examination or treatment for a disability for which service connection has been previously established.   38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). 

Pursuant to Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007), the Board must consider the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim.

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  

A claimant may indicate an intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives the application form within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the completed claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Analysis

On October 23, 2020, a VA RO received the Veteran's formal claim for increased ratings for migraines and a right hip disability in which the Veteran reported that he was totally disabled.  On November 9, 2020, a VA RO received the Veteran's formal claim for entitlement to TDIU.  In the November 2020 rating decision, the VA RO granted TDIU effective May 16, 2020.  In the February 2022 rating decision, the VA RO found a clear and unmistakable error in the November 2020 rating decision.  The RO assigned a new effective date of August 1, 2020, for the grant of TDIU.

The evidence persuasively shows that the claim received on October 23, 2020, is a claim for TDIU.  In the October 23, 2020, claim, the Veteran indicated that he was totally disabled.  Though the formal TDIU claim was not received until November 9, 2020, the Board construes the October 23, 2020, claim as a claim for TDIU.

A review of the claims file reveals that there was no formal claim for an increased rating for TDIU or intent to file a claim for compensation presented that later was associated with a formal claim for TDIU prior to October 23, 2020.  In May 2020, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his right hip disability.  In the May 2020 claim, the Veteran did not indicate that he was unemployable due to the right hip disability.  Neither the Veteran nor his counsel has identified any document dated prior to October 23, 2020, indicating an intent to claim TDIU in particular or any intent to file a claim for compensation presented that later was associated with a formal claim for TDIU.  The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that prior to October 23, 2020, there was formal claim for TDIU or intent to file a claim for compensation presented that later was associated with a formal claim for TDIU.

As for the one-year period prior to October 23, 2020, the Veteran was service connected for obstructive sleep apnea, PTSD with traumatic brain injury, bilateral pes planus, multiple subcutaneous nodules, a left hip disability, a right hip disability, a right knee disability, a right knee surgical scar, a deviated septum, and migraines from October 23, 2019, to May 14, 2020.  From October 23, 2019, to January 31, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 100 percent disabling.  The Veteran was not receiving special monthly compensation based on housebound status during the period from October 23, 2019, to January 31, 2020.  Therefore, the Veteran is potentially eligible for TDIU based on a single disability for purposes of special monthly compensation based on housebound status.

From February 1, 2020, to May 14, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 90 percent disabling with both the obstructive sleep apnea and PTSD being rated 50 percent disabling.  This makes him eligible for consideration under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) from February 1, 2020, to May 14, 2020.

From May 15, 2020, to May 17, 2020, the Veteran was service connected for obstructive sleep apnea, PTSD with traumatic brain injury, bilateral pes planus, multiple subcutaneous nodules, a left hip disability, a right hip disability, a right knee disability, a right knee surgical scar, a deviated septum, migraines, and a right hip scar.  From May 15, 2020, to May 17, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 100 percent disabling and special monthly compensation based on housebound status was granted for that time period.  The Veteran is not eligible for TDIU from May 15, 2020, to May 17, 2020, because he was receiving a 100 percent schedular rating and special monthly compensation based on housebound status during that time period. 

From May 18, 2020, to July 31, 2020, the Veteran was service connected for obstructive sleep apnea, PTSD with traumatic brain injury, bilateral pes planus, multiple subcutaneous nodules, a left hip disability, a right hip disability, a right knee disability, a right knee surgical scar, a deviated septum, migraines, a right hip scar, and temporomandibular joint disorder with bruxism.  From May 18, 2020, to July 31, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 100 percent disabling and special monthly compensation based on housebound status was granted for that time period.  The Veteran is not eligible for TDIU from May 18, 2020, to July 31, 2020, because he was receiving a 100 percent schedular rating and special monthly compensation based on housebound status during that time period. 

The evidence unequivocally shows that Veteran was unemployed as of August 1, 2020.  In a November 2020 VA Form 21-4192, request for employment information in connection with claim for disability benefits, the Veteran's former employer reported that his last date of employment was July 31, 2020.  The employer stated that the Veteran started receiving disability retirement on August 1, 2020.  In an August 2020 statement, a private doctor indicated that the Veteran was totally disabled at this time.  The physician noted that the Veteran was unable to drive, walk without assistance, or complete activities of daily living without some level of help.  The orthopedist stated that the Veteran unable to work until a pending second surgery on the right hip is approved and completed.  The evidence persuasively shows that during the one-year period prior to the October 23, 2020, TDIU claim, it is factual ascertainable that the service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable from performing all forms of substantially gainful employment that are consistent with his education and occupational experience.

As noted above, the Veteran is not eligible for TDIU from May 15, 2020, to July 31, 2020.  As for the period from October 23, 2019, to May 14, 2020, the Veteran reported in his November 2020 formal TDIU claim that he last worked full time on May 15, 2020.  The Veteran added that on May 15, 2020, his disability affected his employment and that on that date, he became too disabled to work.  In the November 2020 statement, the Veteran's former employer reported that the Veteran worked as an equipment operator from January 2007 to July 2020.  The employer noted that the Veteran worked 11.5 hours a day and approximately 35 hours a week.  The employer added that the Veteran earned approximately $125,000 in his last 12 months of employment.  The Board places great weight on the employer statement.  The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that prior to May 16, 2020, the service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable from performing all forms of substantially gainful employment that are consistent with his education and occupational experience.

The claim for an effective date prior to August 1, 2020, for the grant of TDIU is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 1, 2020, for the basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance

Analysis

In pertinent part Chapter 35, Title 38, United States Code extends the VA educational program to a child of a veteran who had a service-connected total disability that was permanent in nature.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501(a)(1) (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021 (2025).  

In the November 2020 rating decision, the VA RO granted basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance effective May 16, 2020.  In the February 2022 rating decision, the VA RO found a clear and unmistakable error in the November 2020 rating decision.  The RO assigned a new effective date of August 1, 2020, for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance.

From October 23, 2019, to January 31, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 100 percent disabling.  From February 1, 2020, to May 14, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 90 percent disabling.  From May 15, 2020, to July 31, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were rated 100 percent disabling.

In an October 2020 rating decision, the RO granted a temporary 100 percent disability rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (2025) for the right hip disability effective from May 15, 2020, to November 30, 2020, and assigned a 10 percent disability rating for right hip disability effective December 1, 2020.  In the December 2022 rating decision, the RO discontinued TDIU and basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance effective December 1, 2022.  The Veteran's service-connected disabilities are rated 90 percent disabling effective.

Given that the 100 percent disability rating from May 15, 2020, to July 31, 2020, was based on a temporary 100 percent disability rating for the right hip disability and given that the service-connected disabilities are now rated 90 percent disabling, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that prior to August 1, 2020, the service-connected disabilities were permanent and total. 

The claim for an effective date prior to August 1, 2020, for the grant of basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
