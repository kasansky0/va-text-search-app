INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from September 1978 to September 1998.

In November 2023, the Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision which addressed the above-noted issues.  Thereafter, in March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), wherein he sought to appeal the claims in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) System.  He selected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the RO issued the November 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's left hip and shoulder claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the readjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(ii).

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim on May 25, 2018, and thereafter submitted a timely formal claim for entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability, which he continuously pursued.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of May 25, 2018, for the grant of service connection for right knee osteoarthritis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Duties to Notify and Assist

As a preliminary matter the Board notes that, with respect to the Veteran's claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date, the pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute, and the law is dispositive.

Thus, there is no additional evidence that could be obtained to substantiate the claim, and no further action is required to comply with VA's duties to notify and assist under 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A, or 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  See Manning v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 534, 542 (2002); VAOPGCPREC 5-2004 (June 23, 2004).

Burden of Proof

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.  VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.  

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  

Earlier Effective Date for Right Knee Service Connection

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim for service connection or a claim reopened after final adjudication, "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore."  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a).  The implementing regulation clarifies this to mean that the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim will be the "day following separation from active service or date entitlement arose if claim is received within 1 year after separation from service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

However, according to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 if VA receives a complete application form appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.

Further, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h), the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options within one year of the issuance of the decision.

The Board finds a brief history of the Veteran's right knee claim is warranted at the outset.  The Veteran initiated an original claim for a right knee injury in August 1998.  His claim was denied by way of an October 1998 rating decision, which the Veteran did not appeal.  The Board has carefully reviewed the records and finds the Veteran also did not submit any new or relevant evidence within the one year period following his October 1998 rating decision.  As such, his October 1998 rating decision is considered a final adjudication.  

The Veteran then submitted an intent to file a claim on May 25, 2018.  Thereafter, on April 24, 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ which included a claim for a right knee disability.  In June 2019, the RO asked the Veteran to submit his claim on a proper Supplemental Claim form, which the Veteran did on June 28, 2019.  In December 2019, the RO denied the Veteran's claim.  However, the Veteran diligently prosecuted this matter by seeking Higher-Level review in May 2020.  

In October 2020, the Higher-Level Reviewer found grave inadequacies in the medical opinions provided following August 2019 examinations.  As such, the RO issued an October 2020 rating decision citing duty to assist errors, and determining additional development and readjudication of the matter was warranted.  Following additional development, the RO again denied the Veteran's right knee claim in a December 2020 decision; however, the Veteran remained vigilant in the pursuit of this matter by submitting another supplemental claim and evidence from his private clinician in April 2021.  His claim was again denied in a July 2021 rating decision, but the Veteran again sought reconsideration of this matter in December 2021, with additional medical evidence in support of his claim.  In June and August 2022, the RO confirmed and continued the prior denials of the Veteran's claim.  The Veteran then asked for Higher-Level review of those decisions in March 2023.  In a March 2023 decision, the Higher-Level Reviewer found further duty to assist errors had been committed, which necessitated readjudication of the claim.  Finally, in September 2023, more than four years after he submitted his June 2019 supplemental claim, the Veteran was awarded service connection for his claimed right knee disability.  At that time, the Board notes, two private clinicians and two VA examiners had each provided positive opinions linking the Veteran's knee disability to his many parachute jumps in service.  

As noted above, the date of receipt of an intent to file (ITF) will be accepted as the date of claim, if VA receives a complete application form appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the ITF.  Here, the Veteran submitted his ITF in May 2018, followed by his completed VA Form 21-526 in April 2019.  Unfortunately, the Veteran did not submit his claim on the correct form, as his right knee disability was previously denied.  Therefore, the RO requested the Veteran complete a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim, in order to address that matter.  The Veteran did so on June 28, 2019.  Since the Veteran's complete supplemental claim more than one year after his ITF was submitted, and after he had submitted other claims on his completed VA Form 21-526 received in April 2019, his ITF cannot be considered the date of receipt of his supplemental claim in this case.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2).  However, as noted above, the Veteran did submit his complete supplemental claim in June 2019, and it is clear he has continuously pursued his claim in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 since that time.  As such, he is entitled to service connection for his right knee disability from the date his supplemental claim was received on June 28, 2019.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802, unless an issue on appeal can be granted in full, the Board shall remand the appeal to the agency of original jurisdiction for correction of an error on the part of the agency of original jurisdiction to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction decision on appeal.  The Board may remand for correction of any error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.

Initially, the Board observes that under certain circumstances, 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4) require VA to obtain a VA examination or obtain a medical opinion.  When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  The failure to provide the above-noted assistance constitutes a due process violation.

Here, the Board notes that to be considered adequate, a musculoskeletal examination must include an assessment of the veteran's flare-ups, as well as range of motion measurements in weight bearing, non-weight bearing, and in passive motion.  See Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017); see also Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).

The Board also acknowledges a recent decision in which the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held applicable diagnostic codes and special regulations pertaining to musculoskeletal disabilities do not explicitly contemplate medication use, and as such, VA must discount the beneficial effects of medication when assigning an evaluation of a musculoskeletal disability.  See Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, slip op. at 10 (Vet. App. March 12, 2025).  In sum, this requires examiners expressly consider and discount the beneficial effects of medication when evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities, to specifically include a discussion of whether a veteran may experience additional functional impairment, to include range of motion loss, without the use of medications.  

The Veteran initiated and has continuously pursued his claims for left hip and left shoulder disabilities since May 2018.  In that time, he has undergone examinations in August 2019, May 2021, May 2022, and August 2023.  A review of those examinations reveals the examiners failed to provide weight bearing and non-weight bearing range of motion assessments.  Additionally, the examiners did not state whether the Veteran would experience additional functional impairment, to include range of motion loss, without the use of his medications.  As such, a remand is necessary to correct these pre-decisional duty to assist errors.

Accordingly, these matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

Obtain a VA examination by an examiner with sufficient expertise to fully assess the severity of the Veteran's service-connected left hip and left shoulder disabilities.  All pertinent evidence of record should be made available to and reviewed by the examiner.  Any indicated studies should be performed.

Ensure the examiner provides all information required for rating purposes, to specifically include both active and passive range of motion testing, as well as weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing range of motion assessments.

In addition, the examiner must consider and discuss all procurable and assembled data such as the frequency, duration, characteristics, precipitating and alleviating factors, and the severity of the flare-ups, and then provide a retrospective assessment of the functional impairments the Veteran has experienced during flares, throughout the pendency of this appeal.

Further, the examiner is asked to consider and expressly state whether the Veteran would experience additional functional impairment-to include range of motion loss-without his use of medications which include NSAIDS, topical creams, and steroid packs.  If so, the examiner should provide an estimate of the additional impairment, if possible, in degrees of additional motion loss.
