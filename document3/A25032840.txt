REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2000 to February 2006.

These claims have a procedural history which includes a Board Decision on March 6, 2024, and a November 2024 Order of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) which enacted a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) vacating the Board's Decision regarding service connection for a left knee condition and right hip condition.  

Shortly thereafter, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a December 4, 2024, rating decision awarding service connection for the left knee strain, right hip strain, limitation of flexion, right hip strain, limitation of abduction, and right hip strain, limitation of extension, all effective February 11, 2019.

The Board notes this decision does not affect the Veteran's ongoing appeal regarding an earlier effective date for these conditions as well as other service-connected disabilities.

The Board's jurisdiction is predicated upon an appeal having been filed on an issue or issues in controversy.

1. As the AOJ already has adjudicated service connection for the Veteran's claim for left knee condition and right hip condition, the issues have been rendered moot. As there remains no case or controversy concerning whether the Veteran is entitled to this benefit sought, the appeal for this claim must be dismissed since there is no remaining case or controversy within the Board's jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105 (d).
