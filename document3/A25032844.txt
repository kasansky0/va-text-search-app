DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of January 6, 2023, but no earlier, for the addition of the Veteran's child, Z.S-N. as a dependent to her award of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

An intent to file a claim for VA benefits was received on January 6, 2023, and a formal claim for VA disability compensation benefits based on recognition of her child Z.S-N., as her dependent was received within one year.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of January 6, 2023, but no earlier, for the addition of the Veteran's child, Z.S-N., as a dependent to her award of VA disability compensation have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1115, 5102, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.204, 3.401.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2010 to September 2018.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 decision letter by a VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), wherein the AOJ informed the Veteran that Z.S-N. had been added as a dependent as of July 1, 2023.

The Veteran appealed this decision to the Board. In the June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. In a Direct Review docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran disagreed with the effective date of July 1, 2023, for the addition of her child, Z.S-N. See June 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. However, the Veteran has not offered any argument as to what date she contends should be the correct effective date. 

The threshold criteria of a minimum 30 percent disability rating for basic entitlement to additional payment for dependents has been met effective for the entire period on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 1115.

When determining the effective date for an award of additional compensation for dependents, the effective date will be the last of the following dates: (1) the date of claim; (2) the date the dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the service member's award. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).

The "date of claim" for additional compensation for a dependent child is the date of the child's birth, if evidence of the event is received within a year of the event; otherwise, the date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within a year of notification of such rating action. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.401.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a), a specific claim must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The Secretary has authority to prescribe the nature and extent of the proof required to establish a right to VA benefits. See 38 U.S.C. § 501.

VA will accept, for purposes of determining entitlement to benefits under laws administered by VA, the statement of a claimant as proof of marriage, dissolution of a marriage, birth of a child, or death of a dependent, provided that the statement contains: the date (month and year) and place of the event; the full name and relationship of the other person to the claimant; and the social security number of the other person. 38 U.S.C. § 5124; 38 C.F.R. § 3.204.

To preserve an effective date, an intent to file a claim may be submitted to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought within one-year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

In a January 6, 2023, letter, the RO informed the Veteran that it received the Veteran's Intent to File a Claim form. Notably, this letter was returned as undeliverable. On July 7, 2023, the RO received VA Form 21-686c Application Request To Add And/Or Remove Dependents for additional disability compensation benefits based on recognition of her dependent child. 

In June 2023, the RO notified the Veteran that the claim for additional dependency was granted for her child, effective date from July 1, 2023. 

As the formal claim was received within one year of receipt of the intent to file, the date the intent to file a claim was received is considered the date of the completed claim, and an earlier effective date of January 6, 2023, is granted.

However, the Veteran did not notify VA within one year of the birth of her son in March 2020, therefore, the Board is unable to assign an earlier effective date from the date of his birth. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b)(1)(i). In addition, the record fails to show that the Veteran had filed an intent to file a claim or a formal claim for dependency benefits for Z.S-N. prior to the January 6, 2023. 

For these reasons, an effective date of January 6, 2023, but no earlier, for the addition of the Veteran's child, Z.S-N., to her award of VA disability compensation is granted. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).
