ORDER

For the entire period on appeal, entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus, stemming from the appeals of the November 2022 and February 2023 rating decisions, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus is assigned a 10 percent disability rating for the entire period on appeal, which is the maximum schedular rating authorized under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6260.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus, stemming from the appeals of the November 2022 and February 2023 rating decisions, are not met for the entire period on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.87, DC 6260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from May 1985 to September 1995.

In August 2022, the Veteran filed VA Forms 21-526EZ requesting an increased rating for his service-connected tinnitus.

In a November 2022 rating decision, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denied entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus.

In January 2023, the Veteran filed another VA Form 21-526EZ requesting an increased rating for his tinnitus.

In a February 2023 rating decision, the RO again denied entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus.

In May 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) and requested direct review of the November 2022 and February 2023 rating decisions by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  For the sake of clarity, the Board has combined the matter into one issue - entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus, stemming from the appeals of the November 2022 and February 2023 rating decisions.  Therefore, regarding the increased rating appeal stemming from the November 2022 rating decision, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of the date of issuance of the November 2022 rating decision (November 25, 2022).  Regarding the increased rating appeal stemming from the February 2023 rating decision, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of the date of issuance of the February 2023 rating decision (February 21, 2023).  Any evidence submitted after these rating decisions cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

As an aside, the Board notes that in his May 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran attempted to appeal the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) which was also denied in the November 2022 and February 2023 rating decisions.  However, in a February 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran previously requested review of the denials of an increased rating for GAD, stemming from the November 2022 and February 2023 rating decisions, which was docketed by the Board in Docket No. 230222-325580 and is still pending review.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a), a claimant may elect one of the following review options for a decision on an issue by the RO: (1) a request for higher-level review; (2) an appeal to the Board; or (3) a supplemental claim.  Concurrent election of the review options is prohibited, meaning that while review under one option is pending final adjudication, the claimant may not file for review under a different available option.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  For these reasons, the Board cannot accept the Veteran's impermissible attempt at concurrent election of another Board review of the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for GAD in the May 2023 VA Form 10182.  Accordingly, that issue will remain undocketed and is not part of the instant appeal stream.

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015).

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus, stemming from the appeals of the November 2022 and February 2023 rating decisions

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a veteran's present symptoms with the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based upon average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular DC, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

A veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).  Where the veteran is appealing the rating for an already established service-connected condition, his or her present level of disability is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Staged ratings are appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  If the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, the claim is denied.

In this matter, the Veteran asserts he is entitled to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for his service-connected tinnitus.  See May 2023 VA Form 10182.

Throughout the entire rating period on appeal, the Veteran has been in receipt of an initial disability rating of 10 percent for tinnitus.  Under DC 6260, a single 10 percent rating is assigned for recurrent tinnitus, whether the sound is perceived as being in one ear, both ears, or in the head.  The maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus is 10 percent.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.87; Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

As the maximum schedular rating for tinnitus under DC 6260 has already been assigned, a higher schedular rating is not available, and the Veteran's claim for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus must be denied.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).  There is no lay or medical evidence of any other symptoms associated with the Veteran's tinnitus, to warrant any separate ratings.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
