REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the Air Force from November 1970 until his honorable discharge in May 1979. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

As an initial matter, on August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). This law, which went into effect in February 2019, creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. 

Following a December 2023 rating decision denying a claim for entitlement to service connection for hypertension, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request. Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the January 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. The AOJ issued the September 2024 rating decision thereafter, denying the Veteran's claim once more. In a September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on January 7, 2025.

Important for this decision, the Board's review of the record under the AMA is limited by statute and regulation. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. §?20.302. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for entitlement to service connection for hypertension, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. 

§ 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

At the time that the Veteran filed his initial claim for entitlement to service connection for hypertension in July 2023, he cited to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) in support of his claim. During an August 2023 VA examination, the Veteran theorized that his hypertension was due to herbicide agent exposure while stationed in Thailand during service. During his January 2025 hearing, he presented evidence of logbooks purportedly showing he participated in TDYs on Thai Air Force bases. 

However, the record is unclear regarding the Veteran's service in Thailand, as the evidence presented during the hearing was never associated with the record. The Board has completed a thorough review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) and military personnel records, which reveals he participated in TDY at sea from January 1972 until October 1972 and from December 1972 to January 1973 under the "foreign service summary" section, but it does not specify where he served. The Board finds that the AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error by failing to verify the Veteran's service in Thailand, if any. On remand, the AOJ shall exhaust all efforts to verify the Veteran's service in Thailand. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ shall request that the Veteran submit the evidence upon which he relied during his January 2025 hearing, to include logbooks purportedly showing he was stationed in Thailand during service.

2. Conduct appropriate development and verify the Veteran's military service to include all periods of active service in Thailand; the periods of service should be identified. Specifically, attempt to confirm whether the Veteran had service in Thailand by contacting the Military Records Research Center (MRRC).  

If there is still insufficient information to verify service in Thailand, issue a Formal Finding outlining the steps taken to assist the Veteran and notify the Veteran of VA's inability to verify his service.  Document all requests for information as well as all responses in the claims file.
