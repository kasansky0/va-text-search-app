ORDER

The appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's March 2025 VA Form 10182 was an improper concurrent election which sought to appeal a rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for hypertension when a higher-level review (HLR) of the service connection claim for hypertension was pending and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made.

2. The Veteran's March 2025 VA Form 10182 appealing the January 17, 2024, Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision was untimely and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for hypertension have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.202, 20.203, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1979 to September 1982 and September 1982 to February 1986.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in an attempt to appeal a January 17, 2024, rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 17, 2024, AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

The appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

By way of background, the Veteran filed an August 2023 claim seeking service connection for hypertension.  In a January 3, 2024, AOJ decision, a decision on the issue of entitlement to service connection for hypertension was deferred.  The AOJ then issued a January 17, 2024, decision denying entitlement to service connection for hypertension.  Thereafter, the Veteran filed a January 2024 Request for HLR of the January 17, 2024, AOJ decision as it pertained to hypertension.

In response, the AOJ issued a January 23, 2024, decision finding a duty to assist error during the HLR pertaining to entitlement to service connection for hypertension.  On January 24, 2024, the AOJ sent the Veteran a Notification Letter explaining that his request for HLR had been completed and that an error had been discovered in assisting the Veteran in his claim pertaining to hypertension.  The AOJ explained the Veteran's claim will be forwarded for further processing to correct the error.  The AOJ subsequently issued a December 2024 decision pursuant to the mandated special review of the Veteran's claim wherein entitlement to service connection for hypertension was denied.  

While this development was pending, the Veteran concurrently filed March 2025 VA Form 10182 seeking to appeal the January 17, 2024, decision as it pertains to service connection for hypertension. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, claimants may elect to review a decision by the AOJ by filing a supplemental claim, HLR request, or Board appeal.  (emphasis added).  The Veteran, however, is prohibited from concurrently requesting multiple types of review.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). 

The Board acknowledges that the Court has held that a claimant may seek a second administrative review option with respect to the same decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run.  Terry v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?1 (2023).  Even so, the Veteran may not seek both review options concurrently.  Id. at 2.  In other words, a second administrative review is permissible if it is timely, and it does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option.  Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A). 

Here, a January 17, 2024, AOJ decision denied the Veteran's service connection claim for hypertension.  In January 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 HLR request regarding the January 17, 2024, AOJ decision.  The AOJ then issued a January 23, 2024, HLR decision identifying a duty to assist error regarding the Veteran's hypertension claim and requested additional development.  After said development was completed, the AOJ issued a December 2024 decision denying entitlement to service connection for hypertension.  Thus, the Veteran's March 2025 VA Form 10182 citing to the January 17, 2024, AOJ decision as it pertained to hypertension was premature.  As such, the Board finds the January 2024 VA Form 10182 was an impermissible concurrent election, and the docketing of the appeal was in error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry, 37?Vet. App.?1 (2023). 

The Board has also considered the applicability of any waiver of the prohibition on concurrent election.? See generally Ferko v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?262 (2024) (en banc) (holding the one-year deadline to file a legacy NOD is not a jurisdictional bar to Board review, but a mandatory claims processing rule); Hall v. McDonough,?34?Vet. App.?329, 332?(2022) (regulatory claims-processing rules may be?waived?without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki,?23?Vet. App.?37, 45?(2009) (VA may implicitly or explicitly?waive?any issue of timeliness in the filing of a Substantive Appeal).  The Board still retains subject-matter jurisdiction over claims on appeal when claims-processing rules are not followed; it is the Board's duty to engage in factfinding and explain the basis for any waiver or forfeiture of the relevant claims-processing rules.? Hall,?34 Vet. App. at 333.

In particular, the Board considered whether it waived its right to enforce the prohibition on concurrent election by virtue of docketing the appeal.? See, e.g., Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46-47 (holding VA waived any objection to the timeliness of the legacy substantive appeal because "VA consistently treated th[e] matter as if it was part of the timely filed Substantive Appeal[]" for over five years....").  To this point, the Board finds that assigning the appeal a docket in and of itself does not constitute a waiver of the prohibition of concurrent election.? Indeed, whether the Board has waived any objection to a concurrent election should be based on all facts and circumstances of that case.  Accord Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46 (discussing VA's actions in that case in finding VA had treated the substantive appeal as timely filed). 

Here, although the Board completed the ministerial action of docketing the appeal, unlike the circumstances of Percy, the Board did not continuously "engage in substantive and procedural development" of the appeal.  There were no further communications, no hearing held, no action in which the Veteran would be under the impression that the merits of the case were examined and being developed in any substantive way.  Accordingly, the Board finds that there has been no waiver of the prohibition on concurrent election under the facts and circumstances of this case. 

Moreover, the March 2025 VA Form 10182 attempting to appeal the January 17, 2024, AOJ decision was untimely.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.203, a Notice of Disagreement must be filed within one year from the date that the agency mails notice of the decision.  Here, notification of the January 17, 2024, AOJ decision was sent on January 18, 2024.  The Veteran, however, did not file a VA Form 10182 until March 2025, more than one year after notification of the January 2024 AOJ decision.  While an extension of the period for filing a Notice of Disagreement may be granted for good cause, the record lacks any contentions of good cause for failing to file a timely appeal.  Even ignoring the timeliness issue, however, the March 2025 VA Form 10182 citing to the January 17, 2024, is an improper concurrent election for the reasons discussed above.  

While it is possible the Veteran desires to appeal the December 2024 AOJ decision which denied entitlement to service connection for hypertension following correction of the duty to assist error previously identified, the Veteran has yet to file a VA Form 10182 to the December 2024 AOJ decision in accordance with 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.  The Board encourages the Veteran to review the notification letter sent with the December 2024 AOJ decision which discusses the Veteran's options should he disagree with the AOJ's decision as the time to appeal the December 2024 AOJ decision has yet to expire.

Based on the above, the Board finds dismissal of the attempted appeal appropriate as the March 2025 VA Form 10182 pertaining to hypertension was an impermissible concurrent election and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made.  Moreover, the March 2025 VA Form 10182 was untimely as to the January 17, 2024, AOJ decision and good cause for an extension has not been shown.  As such, the issue is dismissed.
