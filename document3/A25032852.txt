ORDER

The appeal seeking service connection for acute sinusitis is dismissed.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In October 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision denying service connection for sinusitis. 

2. In December 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and in relevant part sought review of the October 2021 decision that denied service connection for sinusitis. 

3. The AOJ issued a Higher-Level Review rating decision in January 2022 denying service connection for sinusitis.

4. In April 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal that appealed the January 2022 rating decision seeking service connection for sinusitis. The appeal was certified to the Board. 

5. In April 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim seeking service connection for sinusitis, and he did not withdraw the April 2022 appeal before submitting the Supplemental Claim.

6. The AOJ issued a rating decision in July 2024 denying service connection for sinusitis, resulting in this appeal.

7. The April 2024 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim was an impermissible concurrent election for service connection for sinusitis and was adjudicated in error. 

8. In December 2024, the Board issued a decision in the appeal initiated by the April 2022 VA Form 10182 and granted service connection for sinusitis. 

9. The evidence weighs persuasively against a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis .

10. The Veteran's allergic rhinitis does not manifest greater than 50 percent blockage of the nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. Objective evidence of polyps has not been shown during the appeals period.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105, 7108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 20.201, 20.202.

2. The criteria for a compensable disability rating for allergic rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1988 to September 1992, and from November 2001 to April 2002.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision that denied service connection for acute sinusitis and granted service connection for allergic rhinitis and assigned a noncompensable rating. In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in January 2024 and elected the Direct Review docket. The Board may only consider the evidence of record when the rating decision on appeal was issued on July 10, 2024, and cannot consider any evidence received thereafter. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Although the Veteran retained the ability to change his elections as of the time of this decision, the Board finds, given the procedural history of these appeals and the actions taken by the pro se Veteran, prompt adjudication of the appeals in accordance with his original intent does not prejudice the Veteran.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider with respect to the appealed claims, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Dismissal

As a general matter, within one year of the date the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issues a rating decision, a claimant may elect one of three review options, or lanes: (i) Higher-Level Review by the AOJ; (ii) Supplemental Claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(1). If a request for review under one of these three lanes is pending final adjudication, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b), 20.205.

After a claimant elects one of the three available review options, the claimant may not take another action with respect to the same claim until the Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is adjudicated; or the elected request for Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is withdrawn. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c).

1. The appeal seeking service connection for acute sinusitis.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran sought to appeal the July 2024 rating decision that denied service connection for acute sinusitis. After reviewing the record, the Board finds the appeal for service connection for sinusitis must be dismissed because it results from a prohibited concurrent election under the modernized review system. In addition, the Board has already granted service connection for sinusitis as part of an earlier appeal, and the benefit sought in this appeal has already been granted in full.

In October 2021, the AOJ issued a rating decision that in relevant part denied service connection for sinusitis. The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review in December 2021, and in January 2022 the AOJ issued a higher-level review rating decision that also denied service connection for sinusitis. In April 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) appealing the January 2022 higher-level review rating decision, including the claim for service connection for sinusitis. 

Thereafter, the Veteran attempted to file multiple new claims seeking service connection for sinusitis that the AOJ rejected for procedural defects. However, on April 2, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim seeking service connection for sinusitis. The AOJ developed this claim in full and, in July 2024, issued another rating decision denying service connection for sinusitis. The Veteran submitted a second VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement in August 2024, resulting in this appeal.

As explained above, when a claim is denied under the modernized AMA system, a claimant may either elect to submit a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or submit a Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board. A claimant cannot elect multiple review options at the same time for the same claim. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501. Such concurrent elections are specifically prohibited by 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b), which states, "[A] claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option."

Here, the AOJ erroneously adjudicated the April 2024 Supplemental Claim seeking service connection for sinusitis. As explained above, the Veteran already had a Board appeal pending for the same claim for service connection for sinusitis that he had initiated by filing the first April 2022 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. While that appeal was pending, the Veteran filed for review under the Supplemental Claim option in April 2024, which constituted an impermissible concurrent election that should have been rejected as the Veteran did not withdraw the initial appeal initiated by the April 2022 VA Form 10182. Thereafter, the Veteran filed the second VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement for service connection for sinusitis in August 2024, which also constituted an impermissible concurrent election as to that claim which should not have been docketed.

In addition, the Board has already granted service connection for sinusitis. After the Veteran filed the earlier April 2022 VA Form 10182 seeking service connection for sinusitis, that appeal was certified to the Board and assigned docket number 220426-238297. On December 4, 2024, the Board issued a decision that granted service connection for sinusitis. The AOJ implemented the Board's grant in a rating decision issued on December 19, 2024. The issue of service connection for sinusitis has been rendered moot because the benefit has been granted in full. This current appeal was an impermissible concurrent election that should have been rejected. However, there also remains no question of law or fact for the Board to resolve regarding service connection for sinusitis. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. 

Should the Veteran wish to disagree with any issue that resulted from the December 19, 2024 implementing rating decision, he may do so by filing the appropriate form under the modernized system. The Board observes that the Veteran did file a new VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim in January 2025 and appears to be seeking a higher rating for his service-connected sinusitis. However, those downstream issues are not part of this appeal. 

In sum, the record reflects that accepting the April 2024 Supplemental Claim and the August 2024 VA Form 10182 for service connection for sinusitis was in error. As the present appeal is a concurrent election prohibited under controlling law and regulation, the appeal must be dismissed. In addition, the Board has already granted service connection for sinusitis in a separate decision issued in December 2024, which stemmed from the earlier and procedurally correct April 2022 VA Form 10182. The issue of service connection for sinusitis is moot, as the benefit has already been granted in full. The appeal is dismissed. 

2. Entitlement to a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis.

The Veteran seeks a compensable evaluation for his service-connected allergic rhinitis. Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The ratings are intended to compensate impairment in earning capacity due to a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

The determination of whether an increased evaluation is warranted is based on review of the entire evidence of record and the application of all pertinent regulations. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Where there is question as to which of the two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. If the evidence for and against a claim is an equipoise, the claim will be granted. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran's rhinitis is currently assigned a 0 percent noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 6522, which pertains to allergic or vasomotor rhinitis. Under Diagnostic Code 6522, a 10 percent disability rating is awarded for rhinitis without nasal polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. The maximum 30 percent disability rating is awarded for rhinitis with polyps. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

Diagnostic Code 6522 does not provide for a noncompensable rating. However, in every instance where the Rating Schedule does not provide a noncompensable rating for a particular diagnostic code, such a rating shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

The Veteran was provided a VA examination for sinusitis and rhinitis in May 2021. He reported sinus drainage and pressure, and that he had to use sinus rinses. However, the only diagnosis noted in this examination was sinusitis, and no portions of the examination report for rhinitis were completed.

The Veteran was provided a new VA examination for sinusitis and rhinitis in February 2024. He reported current symptoms consisting of runny nose, nasal drip, throat itching and nasal congestion. The examiner diagnosed rhinitis. There was not greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, and there was not complete obstruction on the left or right nasal passages. The examiner found no hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, and no nasal polyps were identified during the examination. X-rays of the Veteran's paranasal sinuses showed the sinuses were clear with intact mucosal and bony margins. 

The February 2024 VA examination is adequate and constitutes highly probative evidence weighing against the claim for an increased rating for allergic rhinitis. Under Diagnostic Code 6522, a 10 percent rating requires a greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. The probative evidence does not support finding such obstruction of the nasal passage on one or both sides. Although, the Veteran reported congestion during the VA examinations, and VA treatment records show he has complained of congestion while being treated for his rhinitis, the probative evidence weighs persuasively against finding greater than 50 percent obstruction, including complete congestion, of the nasal passages.

The Board acknowledges that a recurring nasal polyp was identified in August 2016 following the Veteran's complaints of a bump inside his right nostril that would grow back every other day. A physical examination during an October 2016 VA ENT consultation was negative for any nasal polyps or masses, and a January 2017 followup shows the Veteran reported his nose had gotten much better since he started using Flonase and a nasal wash. VA treatment records continue to show a past medical history of a nasal polyp. Nevertheless, service connection for the Veteran's allergic rhinitis is effective March 18, 2024, several years after the Veteran's nasal polyp was identified. More recent VA treatment records, including those contemporaneous to the effective date for service connection for allergic rhinitis, are negative for current nasal polyps. The physical examination and x-rays during the February 2024 VA examination were negative for nasal polyps. Accordingly, the evidence weighs substantially against finding the Veteran's allergic rhinitis manifests in compensable symptoms under Diagnostic Code 6522 during the period on appeal.

For the above reasons, the evidence for and against the claim is neither evenly balanced, nor approximately so. Rather the probative evidence weighs persuasively against the claim. The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is therefore not for application and a compensable rating for the Veteran's allergic rhinitis is not warranted.
