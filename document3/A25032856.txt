FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment of expenses for non-VA home healthcare services provided to the Veteran from January 6, 2020, to January 23, 2020, and from February 4, 2020, to February 26, 2020, by Elite Care Management, Inc.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The matters of entitlement to the payment of expenses for non-VA home healthcare services provided to the Veteran by Elite Care Management, Inc., from January 6, 2020, to January 23, 2020, and from February 4, 2020, to February 26, 2020, have been resolved in full by administrative action; thus, the appeal as to these matters is moot.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant in this appeal is a non-VA healthcare provider that provided home healthcare services to the Veteran from January 6, 2020, to January 23, 2020, and from February 4, 2020, to February 26, 2020.  In April 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the appellant electing the Evidence Submission docket, to review AOJ decisions, as reflected in October 2020 Explanations of Payment (EOP), that denied payments for the home healthcare services in question provided by the appellant.  

The record reflects that the claims for entitlement to payment of expenses for non-VA home healthcare services provided to the Veteran from January 6, 2020, to January 23, 2020, and from February 4, 2020, to February 26, 2020, have been administratively approved.  An April 2021 letter from the AOJ informed the appellant that upon secondary administrative review of the claims for payment, the appealed claims had been approved to be processed according to VA policy.  Thus, the payments were approved and were pending processing.

While entitlement to payments based on the appealed claims was approved, the Board acknowledges that the actual reimbursed amounts for the claims may be less than the claimed amounts charged by the provider.  If any amount paid is disagreeable to the appellant, the appellant will have been provided with the option to file a separate appeal as to any such action pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

As the administrative action approving entitlement to payments of expenses for non-VA home healthcare service provided to the Veteran by Elite Care Management, Inc., from January 6, 2020, to January 23, 2020, and from February 4, 2020, to February 26, 2020, constitutes a reversal of the prior decisions by the AOJ to deny the payments, with which the appellant had expressed disagreement in this appeal, the favorable administrative action constitutes a full grant of the benefits sought by the appellant within this appeal.  

Accordingly, there remain no current allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration with the respect to the underlying denials of payment of expenses for the non-VA home healthcare services provided to the Veteran by the appellant from January 6, 2020, to January 23, 2020, and from February 4, 2020, to February 26, 2020.  Therefore, this appeal is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
