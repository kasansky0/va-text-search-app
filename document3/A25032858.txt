DOCKET NO. 241003-479069
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to entitlement to service connection for generalized anxiety disorder with unspecified depressive disorder is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In September 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) deferred a decision regarding entitlement to service connection for generalized anxiety disorder with unspecified depressive disorder.  This deferral was not an appealable decision to the Board.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to entitlement to service connection for generalized anxiety disorder with unspecified depressive disorder are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4, 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2004 to January 2008.  He appeals a September 2024 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) deferring a decision regarding entitlement to service connection for generalized anxiety disorder with unspecified depressive disorder.

The Veteran disagreed with the AOJ's deferral.  See October 3, 2024, VA Form 10182.

The Board has authority to make decisions in appeals on all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary of the VA under a law that affects the provision of VA benefits.  38 C.F.R. § 20.104.  An appeal consists of a Notice of Disagreement timely filed to the Board on any issue for which VA provided notice of a decision affecting provision of benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.4.

Here, the AOJ's deferral is not an appealable decision subject to Board review.  In this regard, the AOJ did not decide any question of law or fact, but instead it stated it would adjudicate the service connection claim after further development at a future date.  Accordingly, there is no issue of law or fact for Board review, and the appeal as to this issue is dismissed.
