ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for arthritis and joint swelling is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence does not indicate that the Veteran has a current arthritis or joint swelling disability that is not already contemplated by his currently service-connected degenerative arthritis of the spine.

2. During the pendency of this appeal, service connection for GERD was severed, effective January 1, 2025.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for arthritis and joint swelling have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. Entitlement to an increased rating for GERD is legally prohibited, as retroactive increases and additional benefits may not be awarded after service connection has been severed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 2002 to February 2007.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for arthritis and joint swelling is denied.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d). 

In determining whether?service connection?is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the claimant prevailing in either event. See?38?U.S.C. §?5107(b);?38?C.F.R. §?3.102.

Regarding a current disability, the Board first notes that the claimed disability is characterized "arthritis and joint swelling." The Board also notes that the Veteran has already been granted service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine since February 2007. See March 2025 Rating Decision - Codesheet. 

The Board further notes that the Veteran has provided private treatment records relating to a spine/cervical problem, but such records do not appear to relate to the current claim seeking service connection for arthritis and joint pain. See e.g., October 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. Moreover, the claims file lacks any medical evidence, either VA or private, indicating that the Veteran has an arthritis or joint swelling disability of any part of the body other than his spine. Further, he has not provided any evidence or contention indicating that he has such a condition apart from his spine disability. 

Unfortunately, due to the lack of evidence of any additional arthritis or joint swelling disability, the Board must find that the Veteran does not have a current disability for the purpose of this claim and that the first element of service connection therefore has not been met. Accordingly, the Board must deny the Veteran's claim for service connection at this time. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (holding that a current diagnosis is the cornerstone of a claim for service connection).

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for GERD is dismissed.

While this appeal was pending, the AOJ severed service connection for GERD in an October 2024 rating decision, effective January 1, 2025. The issue of the propriety of the severance is not currently before the Board in this matter.

Under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1), a retroactive increase or other additional benefit cannot be awarded after service connection has been severed. Therefore, the claim for an increased rating for GERD is precluded as a matter of law and the claim is accordingly dismissed.
