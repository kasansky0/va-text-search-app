ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of August 29, 2017, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. VA received the Veteran's intent to file on August 29, 2017; thereafter, the Veteran submitted his initial claim for service connection for a gastrointestinal condition within one year. 

2. The Veteran manifested symptoms of a gastrointestinal condition, which was later diagnosed as IBS, throughout the duration of his claim.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of August 29, 2017, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for IBS have been met.  38 C.F.R. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from May 2007 to May 2013.  

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2023 decision.  In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2023 decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim or a supplemental claim for compensation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall be no earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The statutory provision is implemented by regulation which provides that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The pertinent regulation allows a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim form, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives a complete claim form within one year.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  If submitted in writing, the intent to file must be on a standardized form.  Id.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 19, 2021 for the grant of service connection for IBS

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 19, 2021 for the grant of service connection for IBS.  For the following reasons, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of August 29, 2017 is warranted.

Review of the record shows that on August 29, 2017, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim for Compensation.  Thereafter, on October 16, 2017, within one year of the intent to file, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim, requesting to file a new claim for compensation benefits for "functional gastrointestinal problems."  The Veteran continuously pursued his claim until he was granted service connection for IBS in an August 2021 rating decision.  The AOJ assigned an effective date of April 19, 2021 for the grant of service connection, which it determined was the date of formal diagnosis for IBS.  The Veteran appeals this effective date. 

Review of the medical evidence shows that the Veteran reported a history of symptoms of IBS at an October 2017 VA Gulf War examination, but his symptoms were not evaluated on examination.  Thereafter, a March 2018 VA treatment record documents the Veteran's report of having gastrointestinal issues "for a couple of years," including regular bouts of diarrhea and intermittent abdominal pain and constipation.  The examining physician noted that a diagnosis of IBS should be considered.  At July 2018 and June 2020 VA examinations, the Veteran reported similar symptoms, including having up to four or five loose bowel movements per day, which sometimes cause him to leave work.  Despite the presence of these symptoms, the examiners did not diagnose the Veteran with a gastrointestinal condition.  In August 2021, the Veteran submitted a private gastroenterology treatment record, dated April 19, 2021, documenting a diagnosis of IBS based on the same symptoms he previously reported to his VA physicians and examiners. 

After careful review of the facts of this case in light of the legal criteria pertaining to effective dates, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of August 29, 2017, the date of receipt of the Veteran's intent to file, is warranted for the grant of service connection for IBS.  This is the proper effective date because VA received the Veteran's formal claim for service connection for a gastrointestinal condition within one year of receipt of the intent to file.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). 

In reaching this conclusion, the Board notes that the Court of Appeal for Veterans Claims has held that an effective date should not be assigned mechanically based on the date of a diagnosis, but, rather, all of the facts should be examined to determine the date that the veteran's disability first manifested.  See Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015); DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 58 (2011).  Here, the AOJ assigned an effective date mechanically, based strictly on the first date of official medical diagnosis.  However, the Board finds that the medical evidence is clear that the Veteran actually manifested symptoms of a gastrointestinal condition, which was later confirmed to be a diagnosis of IBS, much earlier - at least throughout the duration of the claim.  As such, the Veteran's disability appears to have manifested at least from the date of his initial claim for service connection.      

According to the applicable law, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an initial claim can be no earlier than the date of receipt of the claim, which, in this case, is August 29, 2017.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The Board need not ascertain the exact date on which entitlement arose in order to conclude that August 29, 2017 is the earliest possible effective date here.  In this regard, to the extent that entitlement arose prior to this date, the date of claim would be the later of the two and, hence, the correct effective date as provided by 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Finally, the Board has further considered whether an even earlier effective date can be assigned.  However, prior to August 29, 2017, the Board does not find that the record contains any other pending or unadjudicated formal or informal claims for service connection for a gastrointestinal condition at any time.    

The pertinent legal authority governing effective dates is clear and specific, and the Board is bound by that authority.  Accordingly, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of August 29, 2017, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for IBS.  To this extent, the Veteran's appeal is granted.
