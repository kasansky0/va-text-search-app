REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 31, 2020, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1998 to October 1998 and January 2000 to March 2002.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in February 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), which, after performing a higher level review of a September 2023 rating decision, awarded a TDIU as of April 21, 2020.  Later the same month, the Veteran timely appealed such rating decision by submitting a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, as the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of such claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that, after the Veteran filed his appeal in the instant matter, the Board issued a decision adjudicating a separate appeal involving a claim for an increased rating for his service-connected right knee disability in September 2024. Therein, the Board assumed jurisdiction over a claim of entitlement to a TDIU pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009), and awarded a TDIU as of January 31, 2020.  Based on such procedural history, the Board has recharacterized the issue on appeal to reflect such newly assigned effective date.  

Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 31, 2020, for the award of a TDIU.

In the September 2024 decision, the Board found that the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for his right knee disability stemmed from April 18, 2011, the date of receipt of such claim and, while such was pending, he filed a claim for a TDIU based, in part, on such disability in September 2021. Thus, the Board assumed jurisdiction over the claim for a TDIU pursuant to Rice, supra, and awarded such as of January 31, 2020, the date of a VA examination demonstrating that the Veteran was unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities.  

However, as noted by the Board in the September 2024 decision, the Veteran's complete employment history is unclear from the record.  In this regard, in March 2013, he applied for VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program benefits and indicated that he was unemployed. Additionally in an April 2013 correspondence, it was determined that he had impaired employability due, in substantial part, to his service-connected disabilities.  Also in April 2013, the Veteran completed a VA form in which he reported an educational history or completing high school/a general education degree (GED).  He further reported a history of unpaid labor in 2006 as tool room specialist and temporary full-time employment from 2003 to 2005 working in convoy/personnel movement control.  However, as the Veteran failed to complete other enrollment requirements for the program, VA informed him that his participation therein had been terminated in April 2013.  

During a January 2020 VA psychiatric examination, the Veteran reported a post-service history of contract work in Iraq, as well as subsequent work as a roof cleaner, in pest control, and in security. He further reported that he had recently lost a job due to his service-connected right knee disability, but was currently working in "events," to include burlesque shows.  

When completing formal TDIU applications in September 2021, the Veteran reported that he had last worked full-time in 2017, with his highest earnings of $60,000 per year in 2004 as a contractor.  He reported that he had worked as a contractor in Iraq for LSI in 2007; a contractor in Kuwait for ITT from 2006 to 2007; and in security at Soap Nightclub from 2016 to 2017.  The Veteran further reported that he had unsuccessful attempts working in security, as a pizza maker, and as a dish washer from 2018 to 2019.  Notably, this work history fails to reference the current employment reported by the Veteran at the time of his January 2020 VA psychiatric examination.  Moreover, VA's inquiries to LSI and ITT requesting his employment history resulted in negative responses as both organizations reported that they had no employment information as he had never been their employee.  

Given the inconsistencies of the employment history provided by the Veteran, to include his report in his TDIU application that he had last worked in 2017 at a nightclub with his seemingly contradictory report of working in events during his January 2020 VA psychiatric examination, and the lack of third party verification of any of his employment history, to include the nature of said employment and the reasons for termination, the Board finds that the record at the time of the February 2024 rating decision on appeal was not adequate to determine whether he is entitled to a TDIU at any point during the appeal period prior to January 31, 2020. Accordingly, a remand is necessary in order to cure such pre-decisional duty to assist error by requesting that the Veteran complete and submit another VA Form 21-8940 with his complete employment history prior to January 31, 2020, to include part-time and seasonal employment with hours worked and income received.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Request that the Veteran complete and return a VA Form 21-8940 with his complete employment history, to include any part-time and seasonal employment with hours worked and income received, prior to January 31, 2020.
