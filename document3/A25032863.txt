ORDER

Entitlement to an initial evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for asthma is granted.

Entitlement to an initial evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for chronic sinusitis with headaches is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's asthma is manifested by a pre-bronchodilator FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent of predicted. 

2. Resolving reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's chronic sinusitis with headaches is manifested by more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for asthma have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.96, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an initial evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for chronic sinusitis with headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.96, 4.97, DC 6513.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the Navy from December 1996 to December 2000.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Board notes that, in May 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), seeking review of the March 2024 AOJ decision. In August 2024, prior to the filing of the Notice of Disagreement, the AOJ issued a decision on the HLR. However, the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement identifies the March 2024 AOJ decision, not the August 2024 AOJ decision, as the decision being appealed. 

A veteran may file more than one administrative review request as to the same AOJ decision on a claim within one year of that decision, so long as another administrative review request is not pending concurrently. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 4 (2023). In this case, the HLR request was no longer pending when the Veteran filed his August 2024 Notice of Disagreement as to the March 2024 AOJ decision. Thus, the Board will construe the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement as an appeal from the March 2024 AOJ decision, consistent with the Veteran's expressed intent.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Evaluations

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Pt. 4. Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history, and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Examination reports are to be interpreted in light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the veteran working or seeking work. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. All reasonable doubt will be resolved in the claimant's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is to be avoided. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261 (1994); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

1. Entitlement to an initial evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for asthma

The Veteran is in receipt of a noncompensable initial evaluation for asthma from August 10, 2022, under DC 6602. On appeal, the Veteran contends that a higher evaluation is warranted. For the reasons that follow, the Board agrees.

The rating period on appeal is August 10, 2022, the effective date of service connection, through the date of this decision.

To warrant a 10 percent rating for asthma, testing must show FEV-1 of 71- to 80-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy. A 30 percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 of 56- to 70-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or DLCO (SB) 56- to 65-percent predicted. A 60 percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, when there are at least monthly visits to a physician for required exacerbations, or, when intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids are prescribed. A 100 percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 less than 40 percent of predicted value, FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or when daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immuno-suppressive medications is required. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602.

The Board notes that it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review. This includes the Veteran's lay statements, VA treatment records, and a March 2024 VA examination. Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record. Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims. See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

As relevant here, in March 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA medical examination. At that time, the Veteran's pre-bronchodilator FEV-1 was 82% of predicted, and his pre-bronchodilator FEV-1/FVC was 67% of predicted. Meanwhile, his post-bronchodilator FEV-1 was 88% of predicted, and his post-bronchodilator FEV-1/FVC was 71% of predicted. The examiner stated that the FEV-1 was the most accurate reflection of the Veteran's functioning.

These test results could potentially support the present noncompensable evaluation (the pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV-1 scores), a 10 percent evaluation (the post-bronchodilator FEV-1/FVC result), or a 30 percent evaluation (the pre-bronchodilator FEV-1/FVC result). The question, then, is which test result to apply for rating purposes. 

38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(5) provides generally that post-bronchodilator results should be used, unless post-bronchodilator results are poorer than pre-bronchodilator results. And 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(6) provides that, where there is a disparity between different pulmonary function tests, the disability should be rated based on the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflect the level of disability. However, by its terms, 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d) applies only to DCs 6600, 6603, 6604, 6825, 6833, and 6840-45, without mention of DC 6602. And no other regulation directs which test results to use when rating a disability under DC 6602. 

Thus, the Board will use the test result most favorable to the Veteran: his pre-bronchodilator FEV-1/FVC, 67% of predicted. This test result warrants a 30 percent evaluation.

The evidence is persuasively against a higher evaluation. The record does not contain FEV-1 or FEV-1/FVC results that would warrant a higher evaluation. Nor does the record reflect at least monthly visits to a physician for required care for exacerbations, more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or daily or intermittent courses of systemic corticosteroids. 

The Board has also considered whether a higher rating would be warranted under a different DC. However, the evidence does not support an evaluation in excess of 30 percent under any DC applicable to the Veteran's asthma. Moreover, because asthma has a specific DC, the Veteran's asthma may not be rated by analogy under a different DC. See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 338 (2015) ("[W]hen a condition is specifically listed in the Schedule, it may not be rated by analogy.") 

In sum, considering the rest results most favorable to the Veteran, a 30 percent evaluation for asthma is warranted. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor an initial evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 777-79 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to an initial evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for chronic sinusitis with headaches

The Veteran is in receipt of a 10 percent initial evaluation for chronic sinusitis with headaches from August 10, 2022, under DC 6513. On appeal, the Veteran contends that he experiences more than six episodes per year of sinusitis and that a higher evaluation is warranted. For the reasons that follow, the Board agrees.

The rating period on appeal is August 10, 2022, the effective date of service connection, through the date of this decision.

The Veteran's chronic sinusitis with headaches has been rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6513 for chronic maxillary sinusitis. Ratings for several forms of chronic sinusitis are provided in the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis, to include DC 6513. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DCs 6510 through 6514.

DC Code 6513, for chronic maxillary sinusitis, allows for a 10 percent rating when there are one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or three to six non- incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted when there are three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.  A 50 percent disability rating, the maximum schedular rating, is warranted following radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis, or near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain and tenderness of affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries. The note to that provision defines an "incapacitating episode" of sinusitis as one that requires bed rest and treatment by a physician. Id.

The Board notes that it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review. This includes the Veteran's lay statements, VA treatment records, and March 2024 VA examinations. Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record. Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims. See Gonzalez, 218 F.3d at 1380-81.

Based on the medical and lay evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence more nearly approximates the criteria for a 30 percent rating for the entire appeal period based on more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.  

At a March 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported having sinus infections "several times" each year, which were treated by antibiotics, usually at home. During such episodes, he experienced headaches, pain and tenderness in the affected sinus, and purulent discharge. The examiner opined that the Veteran had three non-incapacitating episodes in the last twelve months and no incapacitating episodes in the last twelve months.

The same month, at an examination for headaches, the Veteran reported getting chronic headaches when having sinus infection flare-ups or nasal congestion. The examiner stated that the Veteran experienced such attacks of headache pain - which, again, were associated with sinus infection flare-ups or nasal congestion - more than once per month.

Considering the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran experienced three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting (as reflected in the March 2024 sinusitis examination) or more than six such episodes per year (as reflected by the March 2024 headache examination). Resolving reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran experienced more than six such episodes per year and, thus, that the Veteran's disability more nearly approximates the criteria for a 30 percent evaluation. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 777-79.

The record is persuasively against a higher evaluation. Medical evidence does not show radical surgery or near constant sinusitis, as required for a 50 percent evaluation under DC 6513. The Board has also considered whether a higher rating would be warranted under a different DC. However, the evidence does not support an evaluation in excess of 30 percent under any DC applicable to the Veteran's sinusitis. Moreover, because sinusitis is listed in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, the Veteran's sinusitis may not be rated by analogy under a different DC. See Copeland, 27 Vet. App. at 338 ("[W]hen a condition is specifically listed in the Schedule, it may not be rated by analogy.") 

In addition, the Board has considered whether a separate evaluation for the Veteran's headaches might be warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100, for migraines. However, the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis expressly contemplates headaches as a symptom to be compensated, and the record does not reflect that the Veteran experiences a headache disability that is separate and distinct from his chronic sinusitis. Awarding a separate evaluation for headaches would therefore constitute impermissible pyramiding under 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

In sum, resolving reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor, a 30 percent evaluation for chronic sinusitis with headaches is warranted. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a higher evaluation, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 777-79.
