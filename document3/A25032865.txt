ORDER

From June 1, 2023, entitlement to a disability rating of 40 percent, but no higher, for hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, from June 1, 2023, her hypertension symptoms more closely approximated diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. They did not more nearly approximate diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more at any point during the appeal period.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

From June 1, 2023, the criteria for entitlement to a 40 percent disability rating for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7; Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2004 to January 2006.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

VA has adopted a Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule) to evaluate service-connected disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part IV. Disability evaluations assess the ability of the body as a whole, the psyche, or a body system or organ to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, to include employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. The percentage ratings in the Schedule represent the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from service-connected diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The percentage ratings are generally adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the disability. Id. 

In a claim for increase in a previously established rating, the present level of disability is the primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods when the service-connected disability exhibited diverse symptoms meeting the criteria for different ratings during the course of the appeal, staged ratings are to be considered. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Hypertension is rated under DC 7101. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104. A 10 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressures predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressures predominantly 160 or more, or where the individual has a history of diastolic pressures predominantly 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressures predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressures predominantly 200 or more. A 40 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressures predominantly 120 or more. A 60 percent rating, the maximum rating, is assigned for diastolic pressures predominantly 130 or more.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the regulations but is generally defined to mean "being most frequent or common." See Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant. 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C.            § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Further, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the evidence is not in approximate balance and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

From June 1, 2023, entitlement to a disability rating of 40 percent, but no higher, for hypertension is granted.

The Veteran has asserted that an increased evaluation is warranted for her service-connected hypertension. See December 2023 VA 21-526EZ. To be more specific, the Veteran had her service-connection rating for hypertension reduced from 40 percent to 0 percent effective June 1, 2023. See March 2023 Rating Decision. The Veteran has submitted multiple notices to the VA that she is not in agreement with this reduction. See March 2023 NOD, see also April 2023 Correspondence. While the Board notes that the issue of the reduction is not technically raised in this case, this is a continuously pursued increased rating claim, dating to September 2022. See September 2022 VA 21-526EZ. As such, the disability rating throughout the history of the claim is within the purview of the Board in this decision. 

The Board acknowledges, in establishing continuous pursuit, that VA Form 21-526EZ's are not a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, or a VA Form 20-0996, Higher Level Review, or a VA Form 10182, Board Appeal: Notice of Disagreement, claim form. The specific form for filing a claim, however, is a claims processing rule and not a jurisdictional rule. Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 332 (2021) (distinguishing claims processing rules as subject to adjudicatory discretion and jurisdictional rules as unalterable and not subject to adjudicatory discretion). The record otherwise satisfies the supplemental claim requirements. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. With this background, the Board does not find the claim processing defect of filing the claim on a fully developed claims form (VA Form 21-526EZ) instead of a supplemental claims form (VA Form 20-0995) to preclude application of continuous pursuit regulations. Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 332 (while the Board may enforce claims processing rules it is not required to do so); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(h)(1), 3.2501. 

The Board concludes that the Veteran's symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 40 percent, from June 1, 2023. Her symptoms more closely approximated the symptoms associated with a 40 percent rating, and resulted in a level of impairment that most closely approximated the level of impairment associated with a 40 percent rating.

An October 2022 VA examination returned three blood pressure readings: 130/84, 132/86, and 132/88. The examiner noted that the Veteran was prescribed Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams daily, Telmisartan, 80 milligrams a day, and Propranolol 60 milligrams a day. The examiner noted that the Veteran had a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more, and that she had stated that Telmisartan and Propranolol had been added to her prescriptions because of this. The Veteran also reported that her blood pressure had been poorly controlled, and that she had experienced a spell of dizziness within the last month.

A February 2024 VA examination returned three blood pressure readings: 165/116, 174/122, and 175/122. The first reading here is within the standard 10 percent rating according to DC 7101, and the latter two readings are within the standard 40 percent rating according to DC 7101. The examiner noted that the Veteran was prescribed Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams daily and Telmisartan, 40 milligrams a day. She also reported that her blood pressure had been intermittently controlled throughout the years, that she had required medication changes in order to control it, and that she was just currently on one combination medication. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's blood pressure readings as well as unlisted symptoms more closely approximate the criteria contemplated by a 40 percent rating. Two of the three readings in the February 2024 VA examination have diastolic pressure over 120. In addition, the Veteran has stated that her blood pressure is only controlled when on medication. Presumably, when off medication, her symptoms are not controlled. Looking at the history of the Veteran's VA examination blood pressure readings, the most predominant number of readings have diastolic pressure above 120. This is true throughout the life of the case as well as in the time period listed above. 

The Board also finds that this increased rating should extend back to June 1, 2023. The period starting June 1, 2023, currently has a 0 percent rating. There is nothing in the record that would require a 0 percent rating from June 1, 2023, until the February 2024 examination. Therefore, the rating increase will extend back to that date.

Based on the above analysis, from June 1, 2023, a 40 percent rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's hypertension is warranted. Her blood pressure readings were diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. This is consistent with the criteria for a 40 percent evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7101. However, at no point during the appeal period did the Veteran's hypertension warrant a rating to 60 percent. During the period on appeal, and as recorded in the October 2022 and February 2024 VA examinations, the Veteran had no blood pressure readings with diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. Because of this, a rating higher than 40 percent is not warranted.

The Board finds that the October 2022 and February 2024 VA examination reports, describing the Veteran's hypertension symptoms, to be the most probative evidence of record because the examiners reviewed the claims file and provided detailed rationales.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). While the Veteran is competent (qualified) to observe her hypertension symptoms, she does not have the training or credentials to determine the current nature, extent, and severity of those symptoms, as reflected by the applicable diagnostic criteria. Additionally, she does not have the training or credentials to determine the proper disability evaluations concerning her hypertension. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Because of this, from June 1, 2023, a disability rating of 40 percent for hypertension is granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Neither the Veteran nor her representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017). Additionally, the Board is cognizant of the ruling of the Court in Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). In the present case, the Veteran has not specifically argued, and the record does not otherwise reflect, that her service-connected disabilities render her unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation. Accordingly, the Board concludes that a claim for a total disability rating has not been raised. The Veteran certainly may raise this claim in the future, should she choose to do so

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's reports and understands that her hypertension has significant effects on her daily life. However, this disability more nearly approximates the now-assigned 40 percent rating from June 1, 2023, and does not warrant an additional rating increase at this time.

The Board also notes that this decision does not leave the Veteran without recourse.  If her service-connected hypertension should worsen in the future, she is free to file a claim for an increased disability rating at that time.
