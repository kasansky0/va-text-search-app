ORDER

The appeal seeking service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In February 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received written notification from the Veteran through his attorney that it was his intent to withdraw his appeal seeking service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Regarding the claim seeking service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, the criteria for withdrawal of a June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a Veteran who served in the Army National Guard with periods of active duty or active duty for training, to include October 1976 to February 1977; January 1991 to October 1991; August 1, 1992 to August 15, 1992; May 22, 1993 to June 5, 1993; and June 17, 1995 to June 30, 1995.  This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  On his June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

In the present case, after the Board received the Veteran's appeal but prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran through his attorney submitted a written statement ("Motion to Withdraw 10182") in February 2025 (it was re-submitted in March 2025), requesting that his appeal seeking service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, be withdrawn.  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration on the claim.  Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.
