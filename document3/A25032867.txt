REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for the right ankle disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1993 to September 1997 and in the United States Navy from January 1998 to June 2007. 

In May 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2022 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rating decision, which assigned an initial 10 percent rating for the right ankle disability, effective September 30, 2020. 

In June 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal. The Veteran timely appealed this rating decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) and requested the direct review option. Therefore, the Board's review is limited to evidence on record at the time of the April 30, 2022 rating decision.

In the November 2020, January 2022, and April 2022 VA ankle examinations, the Veteran reported he treated his right ankle disability with pain medication, including Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Voltaren gel, and diclofenac gel. 

The VA examiners have not stated whether their functional impact assessments were made with or without considering the ameliorative effects of the Veteran's medication. Notably, the rating criteria for the ankle under Diagnostic Codes 5270 through 5274 fail to consider the ameliorative effects of medication. Therefore, the Board is obligated to contemplate the severity of his right ankle disability absent the use of his various medication to control the condition. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 62 (2012); McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) ("[I]f [a diagnostic code] does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication, the Board is required pursuant to Jones to discount the ameliorative effects of medication."); Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (Vet. App. Mar. 12, 2025).

The failure to obtain a VA examination that addresses the severity of the Veteran's right ankle disability without the ameliorative effects of medication is a pre-decisional duty to assist omission that requires correction on remand.

The matter is REMANDED for the following:

Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate clinician as to the severity of the Veteran's service-connected right ankle disability. [If further examination of the Veteran is deemed necessary, such should be arranged.] The clinician must opine as to what the Veteran's symptoms would be, in terms of the relevant rating criteria, for his right ankle disability without consideration of any ameliorative effects of pain medication (i.e., as if the Veteran were not taking medication) throughout the period on appeal. 

A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed. If it is not possible to provide an opinion without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (i.e., no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (i.e., additional facts are required), or if the examiner does not have the requisite knowledge or training.

(By law, the Board is not permitted to rely on any conclusion that is not supported by a thorough explanation. Providing an opinion or conclusion without a thorough explanation will delay processing of the claim and may also result in a clarification being requested).
