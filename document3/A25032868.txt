ORDER

The appeal for service connection for nephrolithiasis is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In an April 2025 written statement, the Veteran's representative withdrew the Veteran's appeal for service connection for nephrolithiasis.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for service connection for nephrolithiasis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 1975 to June 1978. 

In November 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for nephrolithiasis.  In December 2021, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Hearing docket.

Withdrawal

In an April 2025 written statement, the Veteran's representative stated that the Veteran "cancels/withdraws his Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) appeal for nephrolithiasis as submitted via VA Form Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, on 12/17/2021."  

A representative may withdraw a substantive appeal in writing at any time prior to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) promulgation of a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  The Board finds that the Veteran has effectively withdrawn the appeal for service connection for nephrolithiasis.  Therefore, the Board concludes that no allegation of fact or law remains as to that issue, and the appeal must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.
