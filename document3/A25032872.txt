ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 24, 2008, for the assigment of a 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 24, 2008, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 24, 2008, for the grant of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA), is denied.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the statutory housebound rate specified at 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s), from August 22, 2014, granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits. 

The appeal for a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Service connection for PTSD was granted from January 24, 2008, the date of the Veteran's VA Form 21-526 was received. 

2. Prior to January 24, 2008, the Veteran did not file any claims for service connection or for individual unemployability; service connection is not in effect for any disabilities prior to that date. 

3. The Veteran's TDIU, based solely on the service-connected PTSD, is effective January 24, 2008, and the DEA benefits may be allowed on that same date.

4. The Veteran's TDIU, based solely on the service-connected PTSD, has been shown to render him unable to sustain substantially gainful employment, and he has additional disabilities rated at 60 percent or more beginning August 22, 2014.

5. A February 2020 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision, in pertinent part, granted a 70 percent rating for PTSD prior to March 8, 2018, and denied a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD beginning that date. 

6. In a February 2020 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the Board's decision with respect to a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD. 

7. In a November 2020 VA Form 10182, the Veteran requested review of the February 2020 rating decision, and noted disagreement with the 70 percent rating assigned for PTSD.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than January 24, 2008, for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for PTSD, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.400.

2. The criteria for a TDIU, prior to January 24, 2008, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.18, 4.19.

3. The criteria for the award of DEA benefits, from January 24, 2008, have been met. U.S.C. §§ 3501, 5110, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.350, 3.400.

4. The criteria for SMC at the housebound rate, from August 22, 2014, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1114, 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 3.351 (d), 38 C.F.R. § 20.101.

5. The February 2020 rating decision promulgating the Board's decision as to the rating for PTSD is not an appealable decision; the Veteran's appeal of the February 2020 rating decision must be dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 511 (a), 7103, 7104(a); Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1968 to March 1970. 

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a February 2020 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the November 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On June 10, 2024, the day of the Board hearing, the Veteran's attorney cancelled the hearing. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2020 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

This appeal was previously before the Board in February 2020, when the Board decision granted a 70 percent rating, for the period prior to March 8, 2018; denied a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD, and granted a TDIU, due solely to PTSD. The February 2020 rating decision promulgated the decision made by the Board, denying a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD, and assigning a TDIU and DEA, all effective March 8, 2018. Thereafter, a March 2020 rating decision then granted a 70 percent rating for PTSD and assigned a TDIU and DEA benefits, all effective January 24, 2008. The Veteran's November 2020 VA Form 10182 showed disagreement with the February 2020 rating decision. As such, the Board construes the VA Form 10182 as appealing earlier effective dates for the 70 percent rating for PTSD, for TDIU, and for DEA, while taking judicial notice of the March 2020 rating decision's favorable adjudication.

Finally, September 2024 correspondence from the Veteran's attorney indicated that the Veteran wanted to withdraw multiple AMA dockets. The Veteran and his attorney were sent correspondence on October 18, 2024, asking to verify whether there was an intent to withdraw docket 201118-122801. To date, VA has not received a response from the Veteran, or his attorney regarding whether the appeal, or any issues were withdrawn. As such, the Board finds that all issues remain on appeal. 

Earlier Effective Dates

The statutory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110. Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

In cases involving direct service connection, the effective date will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

An exception to that rule applies, however, under circumstances where the evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation. If an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1)(2). If the increase occurred more than one year prior to date of receipt of the claim, the increase is effective the date of receipt of the claim. If the increase occurred after the date of receipt of the claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1)(2).

Earlier Effective Date - Increased Rating for PTSD

The Veteran asserts that an earlier effective date is warranted for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for PTSD. 

VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526 on January 24, 2008, which included a service connection claim for PTSD. An October 2008 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD, and assigned an initial 10 percent rating, effective January 24, 2008. Then, a December 2008 rating decision assigned an initial 30 percent rating, effective January 24, 2008. As discussed, the February 2020 Board decision granted a 70 percent rating for the period prior to March 8, 2018; denied a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD, and granted a TDIU, due solely to PTSD. The subsequent March 2020 rating decision assigned a 70 percent rating for PTSD, a TDIU, and DEA benefits, all effective January 24, 2008. As such, the Board will adjudicate whether the Veteran is entitled to an effective date prior to January 24, 2008, for the grant of service connection for PTSD. 

Here, the March 2020 rating decision assigned a 70 percent rating for PTSD, effective January 24, 2008, the same date service connection for PTSD was granted. Thus, an effective date for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for PTSD, cannot predate the effective date for the grant of service connection. As such, there is no legal basis to assign a 70 percent rating prior to January 24, 2008. 

To the extent that the Veteran asserts that an earlier effective date is warranted for the grant of service connection for PTSD, after a careful review of the Veteran's claims file, the record is absent for statements or assertions indicating a desire to apply for service connection for PTSD, or any other acquired psychiatric disorder, prior to January 24, 2008. Indeed, the record does not show a claim for service connection for any disability prior to January 24, 2008. Documents in the file prior to this date primarily concern loan guaranty issues and the Veteran's education claims.

As noted above, the effective date of an award based on an original claim for compensation benefits shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a). Here, the Veteran's claims file shows that the first indication that he sought service connection for PTSD was on January 24, 2008, the current effective date for the 70 percent rating. Thus, the earliest possible effective date for his service connection claim for PTSD, as well as the assignment of a 70 percent rating for PTSD, has already been assigned. Accordingly, the appeal as to an effective date prior to January 24, 2008, for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD, must be denied.

Earlier Effective Date - TDIU

In addition to the above discussed statutory guidelines for the determination of effective dates, the Board notes that total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340. Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, the disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and that, if there are two or more service-connected disabilities, at least one must be rated at 40 percent or more and the combined rating must be 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). 

Being unable to maintain substantially gainful employment is not the same as being 100 percent disabled. "While the term 'substantially gainful occupation' may not set a clear numerical standard for determining TDIU, it does indicate an amount less than 100 percent." Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378 (Fed Cir. 2001).

Here, the February 2020 rating decision granted a TDIU as solely due to PTSD. Further, the March 2020 rating decision assigned a TDIU effective date of January 24, 2008, the date the Veteran's 70 percent rating for a TDIU was assigned. As noted above, service connection was not in effect for any disabilities prior to January 24, 2008, and there were no pending claims, to include any increased rating claims, to which a claim for TDIU could have attached. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Given such, the assignment of a TDIU, prior to January 24, 2008, is not warranted. Accordingly, an effective date prior to January 24, 2008, for the assignment of a TDIU, is denied.

Earlier Effective Date - DEA Benefits

Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is a program of education or special restorative training that may be authorized for an eligible person, such as a surviving spouse, if the applicable criteria are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.3020, 21.3021. Basic eligibility for certification of DEA exists if the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service, and either (1) has a permanent total service-connected disability, or (2) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death, or (3) died as a result of a service-connected disability, or, if a service member (4) is on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces and, for a period of more than 90 days, has been listed by VA concerned as missing in action, captured in line of duty by a hostile force, or forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by a foreign government or power. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

Entitlement to basic eligibility for DEA benefits is linked with the adjudication of a TDIU. Because the Veteran's TDIU is effective January 24, 2008, the Veteran is also entitled to basic eligibility to DEA benefits as of that date, by virtue of having been awarded a permanent total service-connected disability. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021(p). 

As discussed, there were no pending increased rating claims, prior to January 24, 2008, such that the issue of a TDIU, could have attached prior to that date. Given such, the grant of DEA benefits, effective January 24, 2008, is the earliest possible effective date. Accordingly, an effective date prior to January 24, 2008, for the grant of DEA benefits, is denied.

Entitlement - SMC(s)

VA's duty to maximize a Veteran's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities establish entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s). See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011). As such, the Board will discuss whether SMC (s) is warranted.

SMC at the housebound rate is payable if a Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent and has an additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i). A TDIU rating based on a single disability is permitted to satisfy the statutory requirement of a 100 percent rating. Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008). A claim for increased disability compensation may include the "inferred issue" of entitlement to SMC, even where the appellant has not expressly raised the issue of SMC. Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991).

As discussed, the Veteran's TDIU, is based solely on the service-connected PTSD. With regard to the disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability, the Veteran meets such criteria on August 22, 2014, the date he was assigned a 20 percent rating for a right shoulder disability, 50 percent rating for headaches, a 20 percent rating for a cervical spine disability, a 20 percent rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy, a 20 percent rating for a left shoulder disability, a 10 percent rating for tinnitus, and a 10 percent rating for left lower extremity radiculopathy. 

Prior to August 22, 2014, the Veteran was only in receipt of the 70 percent rating for PTSD. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. As such, the earliest date the Veteran has been shown to have independently disabilities, rated at 60 percent, is from August 22, 2014. Accordingly, SMC (s) is granted from August 22, 2014. 

Increased Rating

Increased Rating - PTSD 

The Veteran asserts that a higher initial rating is warranted. See VA Form 10182 received November 18, 2020.

As noted above, the February 2020 Board decision granted a 70 percent rating, for the period prior to March 8, 2018, and denied a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD. The February 2020 rating decision effectuated the Board's decision and denied a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD. The March 2020 rating decision made the 70 percent rating effective January 24, 2008. The November 2020 VA Form 10182 showed disagreement with the rating assigned for PTSD. 

Crucially, an appellant cannot challenge the merits of a Board decision by expressing disagreement with an implementing AOJ rating decision. 38 U.S.C. §§ 511 (a), 7103, 7104(a); Harris v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 345, 348 (2005). In other words, the February 2020 rating decision was merely implementing the Board's determinations as to the rating for PTSD, so the Veteran may not challenge that determination by filing a VA Form 10182 asking for review again by the Board. 

The United States Congress has specified the means of challenging a Board decision, primarily through the process of an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). There is also a Congressionally authorized process for challenging a Board decision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE), which has not been asserted here. VA has, by regulation, allowed for two other means of challenging a Board decision, namely through a motion to vacate or a motion for reconsideration. In Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023), the Court held that the Board should assess whether a written expression of disagreement filed in response to an otherwise unappealable rating decision implementing a Board decision constitutes a motion to reconsider the Board decision. The filing of a written expression of disagreement to an otherwise unappealable rating decision within 120 days of a Board decision, (i.e., within the period one must file a Notice of Appeal to the Court) abates the finality of the underlying Board decision until the Board determines whether that written expression of disagreement can be construed as a motion to reconsider the Board's decision. See id. Here, the Veteran's November 2020 VA Form 10182 was received after the 120-day period following the February 2020 Board decision. As such, the November 2020 VA Form 10182 does not abate the finality of the February 2020 Board decision and will not be construed as a motion for reconsideration of the February 2020 Board decision.

Based on the foregoing, on the narrow question of whether the Board can now adjudicate an appeal of the February 2020 rating decision, which merely implemented the Board's February 2020 decision, with respect to the increased rating for PTSD, the Board finds it is legally precluded from doing so. As such, the appeal must be dismissed.
