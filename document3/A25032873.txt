CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Prior to April 23, 2019, the criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent, for RLE radiculopathy, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8520.

2. From April 23, 2019, to June 6, 2023, the criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent, for RLE radiculopathy, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8520.

3. Beginning June 7, 2023, the criteria for entitlement to a disability rating of 40 percent, but no higher, for RLE radiculopathy, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to April 1988.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from March 2023 and June 2023 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In March 2024, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement and selected the Direct Review docket. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 and June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. Any evidence submitted after the respective AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the increased rating claim for the Veteran's left ankle disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by application of the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; see generally 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. Otherwise, the lower rating applies. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

The veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability determinations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the current level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1995). When the factual findings show distinct time periods during which the veteran exhibited symptoms of disability and such symptoms warrant different disability ratings, staged ratings may also be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Id.

Entitlement to an increased rating for RLE radiculopathy.

The Veteran contends his service-connected RLE radiculopathy is more disabling than the 10 percent and 20 percent ratings currently in effect. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran asserts an increased rating is warranted due to the presence of severe symptoms, including pain and paresthesias, that have continued to worsen over time. See June 2023 Peripheral Nerves Conditions VA Examination. He experiences stinging and burning sensations that feel like a torch down his right leg. Id. 

In this instance, the Veteran is in receipt of a 10 percent evaluation for RLE radiculopathy from February 3, 2017, to April 22, 2019, and a 20 percent evaluation from April 23, 2019, to the present, under DC 8520, for paralysis of the sciatic nerve associated with chronic lumbosacral strain with degenerative disc disease. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. 

Pursuant to DC 8520, mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, where the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various diagnostic codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) provides guidance in the assignment and definition of the terms, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe peripheral nerve conditions. Although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, it is "required to discuss any relevant provisions as part of the duty to provide adequate reasons or bases if the Board chooses to rely on an M21-1 provision as a factor to support its decision." Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018). Here, the Board finds the M21-1 guidance helpful, particularly in light of the Court's directive to define the terms and criteria used in rating a veteran's disability.

Under the M21-1, the "mild" level of evaluation is reasonably assigned when sensory symptoms are recurrent but not continuous, assigned a lower medical grade reflecting less impairment, and/or affecting a smaller area in the nerve distribution. M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 12, Section A.2.c. Very minimal reflex or motor abnormality could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis. Id. 

The "moderate" level of evaluation is reserved for the most significant and disabling cases of sensory-only involvement. These are cases where the sensory symptoms are continuous, the symptoms are assigned a higher medical grade reflecting greater impairment and/or they affect a larger area in the nerve distribution. Id. These cases also include those with combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes graded as medically moderate. Id. 

A "moderately severe" evaluation reflects motor and/or reflex impairment reflecting a high level of limitation or disability. Id. Atrophy may also be present. Id. 

Marked muscle atrophy is expected for "severe" paralysis of the sciatic nerve. In general, severe incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve involves motor and/or reflex impairment (for example atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Id. 

In this instance, the Veteran has continuously pursued the claim at issue since the July 2022 rating decision, which implemented the Board grant of service connection for RLE radiculopathy. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), 3.2500(h). Accordingly, the relevant review period on appeal begins February 3, 2017, the date of service connection. 

The Board notes it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review. This includes the January 2018 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) VA examination, January 2018 Peripheral Nerve VA examination, January 2019 to March 2019 VAMC records, April 2019 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) VA examination, October 2022 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) VA examination, April 2023 Peripheral Nerve VA examination, and June 2023 Peripheral Nerve VA examination and medical opinion. 

Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record. Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim. See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). 

As an initial matter, the Board notes the Veteran did not report right radicular pain or symptoms during the January 2018 VA examinations. He was not diagnosed with RLE radiculopathy or any similar medical condition of the right lower extremity during either examination. All test results were within normal limits and the Veteran indicated he did not use any assistive devices at that time. 

With regard to impairment of motor function, the Veteran was assessed for lower extremity radiculopathy by a VA provider in January 2019. The Veteran was noted to ambulate independently using a cane with a slow waddling gait. In a March 2019 physical therapy appointment, the Veteran described primarily using a cane for community distance ambulation and trying to stay active by swimming and going to the gym.  

During the April 2019 and October 2022 VA examinations, the Veteran reported he cannot sit down, stand up, or walk for long periods. Both examiners noted his radicular pain (discussed below) is exacerbated by sitting, standing, and walking. Muscle strength testing of the right leg was normal.

As of the April 2023 VA examination, the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy was found to impact his ability to stand, squat, and climb. His muscle strength testing had decreased and was identified as "active movement against some resistance." The examiner noted the Veteran displayed an abnormal gait due to RLE radiculopathy and was observed to use a cane and "hobble." He also uses a brace, walker, and scooter. 

During the June 2023 VA examination, the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy continued to impact his ability to stand, squat, and climb. His muscle strength testing decreased and was identified as "active movement against gravity." The examiner noted the Veteran displayed an abnormal gait described as antalgic, with some waddling, and ambulates with a walker, consistent with RLE radiculopathy. He continues to use a cane and scooter as well. 

As it relates to sensory disturbance, January 2019 VA treatment records note the Veteran experienced numbness in the RLE but sensation to light touch remained intact. The April 2019, October 2022, April 2023, and June 2023 examinations all note decreased sensation to light touch in the RLE. The April 2019 examiner identified moderate paresthesias and numbness and found that the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy was overall moderate in severity. 

The October 2022 examiner identified moderate paresthesias and mild numbness of the right sciatic nerve root. The April 2023 examiner identified moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve and moderate numbness in the RLE. 

During the June 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported experiencing tingling, stinging, and burning sensations that feel like a torch on his right leg. The June 2023 examiner identified moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve and severe numbness in the RLE. The examiner opined that "the numbness, tingling, pin-like, and burning sensations [went] from intermittently and [] progressed to constant paresthesias of the right lower extremity along with more weakness, and a total loss of feeling." 

With regard to pain, the Veteran reported in January 2019 that he experiences intermittent bilateral radicular pain in the lower extremities. In March 2019, the Veteran stated he has back pain with radiating symptoms, with left leg pain worse than the right. His pain level can reach 10/10 and is exacerbated by lifting and standing. 

The April 2019 examination notes the Veteran experiences pain radiating to his legs with tingling and numbness. The sciatic nerve was found to be symptomatic of severe intermittent pain. The October 2022 examination also notes pain radiating to his legs. The examiner found these symptoms consistent with mild intermittent pain of the sciatic nerve. The April 2023 examiner identified mild constant pain due to RLE radiculopathy. As of the June 2023 examination, the examiner found the Veteran's radicular pain progressed to constant, severe pain of the RLE. 

Regarding the loss of reflexes, January 2019 treatment records reflect normal deep tendon reflexes. The April 2019, October 2022, April 2023, and June 2023 examinations all note hypoactive reflexes of the right knee and ankle. 

The record does not reflect trophic changes, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis with evidence of either foot dangling or dropping, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, or flexion of knee weakened or lost.

Based on the above, prior to April 23, 2019, the Board finds the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy is primarily manifested by mild impairment of motor function, sensory disturbances, and pain, supporting a 10 percent rating under DC 8520. 

The January 2018 VA examinations did not provide a diagnosis of RLE radiculopathy and VA treatment records from January 2019 to March 2019 reflect mild impairment of the Veteran's overall functioning. While the Veteran experienced some numbness, as of January 2019, his sensation to light touch in the right extremity remained intact. In March 2019, the Veteran reported staying active by swimming and going to the gym.

Accordingly, the Board finds that prior to April 23, 2019, the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy did not result in significant sensory changes or motor deficits consistent with moderate impairment of the sciatic nerve. Thus, the record does not support a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to that date.  

From April 23, 2019, to June 6, 2023, the Board finds the records supports a continuation of the 20 percent rating currently in effect as the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy is consistent with symptoms of moderate severity during this period. The April 2019 examination identified increased difficulty with ambulation, moderate paresthesias and numbness, severe intermittent pain, and found that the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy was overall moderate in severity. The October 2022 examiner identified moderate paresthesias and mild numbness of the right sciatic nerve root.  

The April 2023 examiner assessed moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve and moderate numbness in the RLE. While the Veteran did experience impairment of motor function at this time, he was still able to ambulate independently with the use of assistive devices and maintained normal or only slightly diminished strength in his RLE. 

As such, the Board finds the Veteran's level of impairment from April 23, 2019, to June 6, 2023, did not rise to a high level of limitation or disability to support an increased rating, and most closely approximates moderate, incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve as contemplated for a 20 percent evaluation under DC 8520.

Beginning June 7, 2023, the evidence shows further worsening of the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy consistent with moderately severe impairment of the sciatic nerve. The June 2023 examination found the Veteran's symptoms had progressed from intermittent radicular pain and numbness to constant paresthesias of the RLE with more weakness and a total loss of feeling. The Veteran's pain increased to constant, severe pain along with severe numbness and additional impacts to his motor function and ambulation. The examiner opined the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy is consistent with moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. The Board, therefore, finds that the record supports an increased rating to 40 percent for the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy beginning June 7, 2023, pursuant to DC 8520.

 In addition, the Board finds that the January 2018, April 2019, October 2022, April 2023, and June 2023 VA examinations do not demonstrate trophic changes, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis. As such, the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy meets the necessary level of severity to support a 40 percent rating as of June 7, 2023, but does not meet the requisite criteria to warrant either a 60 or 80 percent evaluation under DC 8520 at any point during the appeal period on review.

The Board has also considered whether the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy may warrant a rating in excess of those currently assigned under other diagnostic codes pertaining to impairment associated with other peripheral nerves. However, where there is a diagnostic code that addresses the particular service-connected disability, to evaluate that disability under another code would constitute impermissible rating by analogy. Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 338 (2017). In light of Copeland, the Board rates this disability only under the diagnostic code for paralysis of the sciatic nerve. Accordingly, no higher or separate evaluation is for assignment under alternative codes.

In conclusion, the Board finds the relevant evidence supports a disability evaluation of 10 percent prior to April 23, 2019, 20 percent from April 23, 2019, to June 6, 2023, and an increase to 40 percent from June 7, 2023, for the Veteran's RLE radiculopathy. As the evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of a higher evaluation, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for a left ankle disability. 

The Veteran contends his service-connected left ankle disability is more disabling than the 10 percent rating currently in effect. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran asserts an increased rating is warranted due to worsening pain and stiffness that make it difficult for him to stand or walk for prolonged periods. See October 2022 VA Examination. 

Under the provisions of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand a claim to correct a duty to assist error made by the AOJ if that error occurred prior to the issuance of the rating decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Board notes that a review of the record reveals the Veteran takes medication for the treatment of his left ankle disability. See October 2022 VA Examination. As the applicable diagnostic codes and special musculoskeletal regulations do not reference medication, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects when assigning an evaluation. See Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025).  

Here, the medical evidence of record is inadequate to the extent it is unclear whether the ameliorative effects of such medication, if any, were discounted in determining the severity of the Veteran's left ankle disability. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012). As such, the Board finds that a remand is necessary to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of the Veteran's left ankle disability. An examination should only be scheduled if the clinician deems one is necessary to provide the requested opinions. 

(a.) The examiner should indicate whether any medications used by the Veteran are productive of ameliorative effects on the service-connected left ankle disability. 

(b.) If so, the examiner must identify each medication and clearly explain what the Veteran's symptoms and ranges of motion would be without the medication in all relevant measurements, to include during flare-ups or with repeated use over time.

(c.) In so opining, the examiner should consider the lay and medical evidence of record. 

A rationale for all opinions must be provided. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, he or she must explain why an opinion cannot be provided (e.g. lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).
