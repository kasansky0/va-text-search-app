DOCKET NO. 211012-191845
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 31, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in this appeal, the Veteran's representative requested withdrawal of the claim for entitlement to a TDIU. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the claim for entitlement to a TDIU by the Veteran's representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1999 to October 2006. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The claim is now before the Board on an October 2021 Hearing Review Request by the Veteran under the Appeals Modernization Act (2019) ("AMA"). Under the AMA, when a claimant seeks appellate review through the Board's hearing docket, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, additional evidence submitted on the date of the Board hearing (including testimony), and additional evidence submitted within 90 days of the hearing. Pub. Law 115-55 (Aug. 23, 2017), 131 Stat. 1114, 38 U.S.C. § 7113(b). The Board cannot consider (1) evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and before the VA Form 10182 was received, (2) evidence submitted during the period after the VA Form 10182 was received and the day before the Board hearing, and (3) evidence received 91 or more days after the Board hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

On March 31, 2025, the Veteran's representative provided correspondence indicating that the Veteran wished to withdraw the issue of entitlement to a TDIU noting that the Veteran understands the consequences of his decision. The Representative is simultaneously withdrawing representation. The Board notes a March 2023 rating decision granted TDIU and a September 2023 rating decision made it effective August 1, 2021. 

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.?38 C.F.R. § 20.205.? Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.? 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.? In the present case, the representative has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no issues for appellate consideration.?Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
