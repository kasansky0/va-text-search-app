REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1992 to March 2000, in the United States Marine Corps.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2022 higher level review rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The June 2022 decision was issued in response to the Veteran's request for higher level review of a January 2022 rating decision.

In May 2023, the Veteran timely filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, electing the Direct Review docket. However, the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was accompanied by additional evidence. The Board recognizes that it has a duty to seek clarification of a veteran's intention to elect the Direct Review docket when additional evidence is submitted with a Form 10182 electing direct review. See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). Accordingly, a clarification letter was sent to the Veteran on February 5, 2025, explaining to him the steps that he should take if he wanted to have the evidence submitted with his Form 10182 be considered in conjunction with this appeal. As 60 days have elapsed and the Veteran has not responded to the letter, the Board will proceed with adjudication of the case on the Direct Review docket.

Given this procedural history, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2022 rating decision. See 38?C.F.R. ยง 20.301. If any evidence was submitted after the January 2022 rating decision, it was not considered. However, as the claims are being remanded, any such evidence will be considered by the RO on remand.

1. Service connection for brachial plexus neuropathy 

2. Service connection for degenerative disc disease 

3. Service connection for right shoulder condition

The Veteran contends that he suffers from brachial plexus neuropathy, degenerative disc disease, and a right shoulder condition as a result of a 1996 in-service motor vehicle accident. Upon review of the record on appeal, the Board finds that pre-decisional duty to assist errors occurred and remand of the Veteran's claims is needed. See 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.802(a).

Prior to the January 2022/June 2022 rating decisions on appeal, the RO obtained VA examinations and medical opinions in November 2021 regarding the Veteran's claims for service connection. The November 2021 examiner diagnosed brachial plexus neuropathy, degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, and right shoulder strain.

The November 2021 examiner opined that none of the above conditions are related to the Veteran's service. However, the examiner provided only a very general, vague rationale that did not include any actual discussion or analysis of the Veteran's in-service complaint of back and neck pain following his 1996 in-service motor vehicle accident. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (holding that it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes to the probative value of a medical opinion); Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020) (noting that an examiner must address a veteran's lay statements in order to provide the Board with an adequate medical opinion).

Based on the above, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error has occurred and remand is warranted in order to obtain adequate opinions regarding whether the Veteran's current brachial plexus, back, and right shoulder conditions are related to his in-service accident. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (holding that when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate).

As the Veteran's claims cannot be granted under any raised theory of entitlement based on the current evidence of record, remand to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist errors is necessary. (The Board acknowledges the Veteran's belief that his current conditions were caused by his in-service accident. See Veteran's November 2021 claim for service connection and Veteran's November 2021 statement. However, while the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms, he has not shown that he has specialized training sufficient to render a medical opinion as to the etiology of nerve and spinal conditions. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis). The etiology of the Veteran's claimed disabilities is a medically complex issue that requires medical expertise to determine. Accordingly, the Board notes that it cannot find the Veteran's opinion to be competent medical evidence.) 

In remanding this case, the Board makes no credibility determination, express or implied, at this juncture. See Miller, 32 Vet. App. at 259-62 (noting that a medical opinion may inform the Board's understanding of the medical feasibility and credibility of lay statements).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain medical opinions regarding whether the Veteran's brachial plexus neuropathy, degenerative disc disease, and/or right shoulder strain are related to his in-service motor vehicle accident.

2. Then, readjudicate the claims.
