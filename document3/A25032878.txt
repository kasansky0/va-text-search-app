ORDER

Entitlement to transfer of educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (Post-9/11 GI Bill) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The available evidence does not reflect that the relevant service department has approved the Veteran's transfer of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits to his family members.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to transfer of educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3311, 3319, 5302; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9570.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1986 to September 1990, and from January 1991 to March 1991.  He also served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1994 to August 2010.  His decorations include the Southwest Asia Service Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2022 determination issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Muskogee, Oklahoma.  The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in April 2023, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the Veteran's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to transfer of educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill)

The Post-9/11 GI Bill (38 U.S.C. Chapter 33) provides VA educational assistance to members of the Armed Forces based on active duty service after September 10, 2001.  38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520.  As noted above, the Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force after that date.

The Chapter 33 provisions that pertain to the transfer of unused educational assistance benefits to family members under the Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) program are found at 38 U.S.C. § 3319.  An eligible individual is any member of the uniformed services who, at the time of the approval of the individual's request to transfer entitlement to educational assistance under this section, has completed at least (1) six years of service in the Armed Forces and enters into an agreement to serve at least four more years as a member of the uniformed services; or (2) the years of service as determined in regulations pursuant to subsection (j).  38 U.S.C. § 3319(b).

The service department is charged with making determinations of eligibility for transfer of Chapter 33 entitlement to dependents; VA has no authority make such a determination.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3319(a)(1) ("the Secretary concerned may permit an individual . . . to elect to transfer to one or more . . . dependents . . . a portion of such individual's entitlement to such assistance . . ..") (emphasis added); see also 38 C.F.R. § 21.9570; 74 Fed. Reg. 14,654 (2009); Garza v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 222, 230 (2016).

In this case, the AOJ denied the Veteran's request to transfer his Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) benefits on grounds that the relevant service department (the United States Air Force) had not indicated that any of his family members had been approved for the transfer program.  In pertinent part, the record available for review includes VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR) Information Reports dated in November 2021 and June 2022 which reflect that none of his education benefits had been transferred to anyone under the TOE program.

The VADIR database is an electronic repository of military personnel service history, payroll information, and dependents' data provided to VA by DoD's Defense Manpower Data Center.  VA applications use the VADIR database to retrieve profile data, as well as information as to address, military history, compensation and benefits, disabilities, and dependents.  Information set out in an Information Report produced from the VADIR database is information received from DoD.  Here, the reports reflect that DoD has not approved the Veteran for the transfer of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits to his family members.

The Board observes that in his VA Form 10182, the Veteran noted that he was a war veteran.  Although the Board is certainly appreciative of his many years of service, his status as a war veteran is not dispositive of the issue at hand.  In that regard, the Board must reiterate that a decision as to the transferability of Chapter 33 benefits rests with the relevant service department, and not VA.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3319; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9570.  As such, and because the available evidence does not reflect that the service department has made a favorable determination in that regard, the benefit sought on appeal cannot be granted as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

If the Veteran wishes to further pursue the matter, he should contact his service department to determine which steps, if any, he may take in order to transfer any unused Chapter 33 educational assistance benefit to his family members.
