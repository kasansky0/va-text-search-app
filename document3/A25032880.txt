REMANDED

Entitlement to eligibility to enroll in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)'s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC).

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1992 to June 2001.  

In January 2022, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review a November 2021 decision by a VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. As the Board is remanding the claim on appeal to the AOJ, any such additional evidence may be considered by the AOJ in further adjudication.  

The Veteran in this case has been assigned a disability rating of at least 70 percent since 2014. The application at issue was received by VA in November 2021. The AOJ denied the claim in November 2021 because the serious injury for which the Veteran is service-connected was incurred prior to September 11, 2001, which meant he was not eligible for PCAFC benefits at that time.

Subsequently, the Veteran received notice in January 2022 that he was able to appeal the denial to the Board. Beaudette v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 95 (2021).

At the time of the decision on appeal, veterans with serious injuries incurred prior to September 11, 2001, were not eligible for PCAFC benefits. Since the initial decision, all periods of service have now become eligible. The Board notes that VA MISSION Act of 2018 expanded PCAFC eligibility to include Veterans from all service eras, effective on October 1, 2020, that was phased in. 38 U.S.C. § 1720G(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 71.20(a)(2). Effective October 1, 2022, individuals with serious injuries incurred during the Veteran's service period were eligible if they met all of the requirements outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 71.20. Therefore, such is no longer a threshold bar to basic eligibility for PCAFC. 

The AOJ undertook no further action on the claim and did not deny the claim on any alternative eligibility criteria.

Because the serious injury incurred by this Veteran now meets the criteria for PCAFC eligibility, remand is warranted to satisfy the regulatory and statutory duties under 38 U.S.C. § 1720G and 38 C.F.R. § 71.20 as such has a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Undertake any appropriate action(s) to process the claim for PCAFC eligibility.
