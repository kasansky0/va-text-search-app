ORDER

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is related to his service-connected tension headaches, left leg shin splints with knee pain, and right leg shin splint with knee pain, with obesity as an intermediate step.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310; VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 (Jan. 6, 2017).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2001 to October 2007.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection shall be granted on a secondary basis under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 where it is demonstrated that a service-connected disorder has caused or aggravated a nonservice connected disability.  See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

The Board notes that although obesity is not a condition for which service connection may be granted, obesity may qualify as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and another current disability. See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017; see also Garner v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 241 (2021); Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020).  In a secondary service connection claim, a theory of obesity as an intermediate step is raised when there is some evidence in the record which draws an association or suggests a relationship between the veteran's obesity, or weight gain resulting in obesity, and a service-connected condition.  Garner, supra.

In the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran's service treatment records reflect an active problem of sleep disturbances in July 2007. The Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings under the AMA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

In June 2023, in association with his claim, the Veteran submitted a lay statement outlining the history of his condition and explaining that after experiencing symptoms (breathing pauses while sleeping, snoring, headaches upon awakening, daytime fatigue, and poor concentration), he underwent a sleep study in October 2021. The record contains a private August 2022 sleep study which reflects the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, such diagnosis is also reflected in the September 2023 VA examination. Accordingly, the question is whether the current disability is related to his military service or a service-connected disability.

In association with his claim, in June 2023, the Veteran submitted a private opinion from advanced registered nurse practitioner (ARNP) N.K. who opined it is more likely than not that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was caused by weight gain related to his service-connected tension headaches, right leg shin splints with knee pain, and left leg shin splits with knee pain (hereafter "service-connected disabilities." In support of her opinion, ARNP N.K. explained that based on the Veteran's reports and the evidence of record, the Veteran's weight gain and current obesity developed after the musculoskeletal symptomology related to his service-connected disabilities. She explained that the Veteran's current BMI of 33.3 meets the national standard set forth by the CDC for obesity. She further explained that due to the persistent pain of the Veteran's service-connected knee conditions, the Veteran was unable to be as active as he was before such conditions and subsequently began to gain weight. APRN N.K. explained the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea related to obesity and cited numerous medical studies and treatise evidence supporting a causal relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and obesity. The Board affords such opinion great probative value as it properly considers the Veteran's lay statements, his medical circumstances, and provides a thorough rationale supported by medical evidence for the opinions given. 

In September 2023, in association with the September 2023 VA examination, VA obtained an opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is less likely than not caused by the Veteran's service. The examiner explained that "despite having some symptoms of sleep disturbance during service," the Veteran was first diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2016, nine years after his separation from the military, and therefore, it is less likely than not that the current obstructive sleep apnea existed during the time of service. The Board affords this opinion low probative value as it does not provide a rationale for its conclusion beyond the passage of time, contains an inaccurate (or inconsistent with examination report and other documented information) diagnosis date, and does not provide an etiology for the in-service sleep disturbance. Moreover, the September 2023 examiner did not address the private June 2023 opinion of record. 

In association with his notice of disagreement in September 2024, the Veteran put forth a more detailed argument regarding the contended etiology of his sleep apnea. Specifically, the Veteran, through his representative, more fully assert that his obstructive sleep apnea is secondary to his service-connected tension headaches, right leg shin splints with knee, and left leg shin splints with knee pain which caused weight gain and obesity. While the VA examiner failed to comment on the issue of obesity as an intermediate step despite the presence of the June 2023 private opinion regarding such, the Board finds that remanding for such an opinion would only serve to further delay resolution of this appeal, with no benefit flowing to the Veteran.

?

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds the necessary factors for the Veteran's obesity to be considered an intermediate step between his obstructive sleep apnea and his service-connected disorders have been satisfied.  Consequently, entitlement to service connection for OSA as secondary to his service-connected musculoskeletal disorders, with obesity as an intermediate step, is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.310.
