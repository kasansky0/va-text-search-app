ORDER

The December 2007 rating decision contained clear and unmistakable error (CUE) and service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities secondary to her service-connected lumbar disc disease ("low back disability") with an effective date of June 21, 2007 is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The statutory or regulatory provisions were not correctly applied in the June 2007 rating decision, and the failure to correctly apply the laws and regulations manifestly changed the outcome of that rating decision. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the June 2007 rating decision contained CUE and service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities effective June 21, 2007, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A, 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from November 1999 to June 2007.? 

This case is being reviewed according to the appellate process set forth under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (hereinafter the "Appeals Modernization Act").  The Appeals Modernization Act became effective February 19, 2019.  

In February 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) initially denied the claim.  In January 2023, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement and elected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  Accordingly, the Board considers the matter per the Direct Review Docket, according to which the appellate review proceeds without additional time allocated for a Board hearing or forwarding further evidence.? 

1. The December 2007 rating decision contained CUE and service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities secondary to her service-connected low back disability with an effective date of June 21, 2007 is granted. 

The Veteran seeks revision of the February 2022 rating decision.  Specifically, the Veteran argues that an earlier effective date of June 21, 2007 is warranted for the grant of service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities as that date coincides with the effective date for service-connected low back disability. 

A previous RO determination that is final and binding will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE.  Where evidence establishes such error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  Here, the December 2007 rating decision was final because the Veteran did not submit a timely notice of disagreement or new and material evidence within one year of the decision.

Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.  CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error."  It is the kind of error of fact or law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.  Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudication improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE.  Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of error."  Fugo v. Brown, 6. Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993).  In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different.  Id. At 44.

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated[;]" and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time the decision was rendered.  Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision.  See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F. 3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  A manifest change in outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset.  King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014).  The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different.  Id. At 442.

The Board notes that at the time of the December 2007 rating decision, the General Rating Formula for Disease and Injuries of the Spine (General Rating Formula) effective since September 26, 2003, provides a single set of criteria for rating conditions of the spine, no matter which spine-related diagnostic code applies.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235 to 5243.  Under the General Formula, associated neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment (or radiculopathy), are evaluated separately under the appropriate diagnostic codes.  Id. at Note (1).  As such, the Veteran could have been assigned for her orthopedic manifestations and neurological manifestations separately. 

As a threshold matter, the Board finds the argument advanced by the Veteran alleges CUE with the requisite specificity.  See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003).  The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of his claim.

In its December 2007 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for her low back disability but did not grant service connection for her radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities.  Then, in October 2008, the Veteran filed a service connection claim and in a September 2009 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for her radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities and assigned an effective date of October 28, 2008.  

The evidence of record at the time of the December 2007 rating decision consisted of a February 2004 service treatment record (STR) that shows an eight month history of worsening low back pain and paresthesias and numbness radiating to the right posterior thigh to plantar surface of her foot.  See April 2009 STR - Medical.  A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar spine revealed a board based disk bulge at the L5-S1 level that may contact the L5 nerve root on that side.  In a July 2004 STR, she was treated with selective nerve root blocks for her degenerative disc disease with L5/S1 radiculopathy.  See December 2014 STR - Medical.  In a November 2004 STR, she was positive on straight leg raising test.  A June 2005 STR shows that she endorsed having recurrent back pain, numbness, and tingling.  See December 2004 STR - Medical.  She was continuously diagnosed with lumbar radiculopathy in a November 2006 and December 2006 STR.  See October 2007 STR.  A February 2007 medical evaluation board proceedings noted that she complained of low back pain with intermittent radiculopathy on the right side.  A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the low back revealed broad based disk bulge at L4/L5 which may have contacted the right L5 root.  See September 2007 Medical Evaluation Board Proceedings. 

The Board notes that in the December 2007 rating decision, the RO noted that there was radiation in her bilateral lower extremities, but did not address why service connection was not granted for her disabilities.  Thus, the RO's failure to follow the regulation requiring that it base its determination on all evidence of record, is an error sufficient to satisfy the first CUE requirement.  See Bouton v. Peake, 23 Vet. App. 70, 72 (2008); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Such error, however, cannot constitute CUE unless it is the type of error that would have manifestly changed the outcome of the RO's decision in December 2007.  This may be shown where all evidence at the time of the decision "militated in support of the claim."  Crippen v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 412, 422 (1996).

Here, at the time of the December 2007 rating decision, the Veteran's STRs and medical treatment records credibly supported a finding that her radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities associated with her low back disability was diagnosed as early as 2004.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Critically, VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection for a low back disability in September 2007, and the RO correctly granted an effective date of June 21, 2007, the day after separation, in the December 2007 rating decision.  As the Veteran's radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities has been found to be associated with the Veteran's low back disability and her radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities has a diagnosis date of 2004 clearly marked in her STRs, an effective date of June 21, 2007, is warranted.  As a result, the Board finds that the RO's error manifestly changed the outcome of the RO's decision.

In sum, the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring the RO to base its decision on all evidence of record at that time was not correctly applied in the December 2007 rating decision, and the failure to correctly apply the laws and regulations manifestly changed the outcome of that rating decision.  As a result, the Board concludes that entitlement to revision of the December 2007 rating decision on the basis of CUE to reflect the grant of service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities associated with her service connected low back disability, effective June 21, 2007, that is, the date of the Veteran's service connection claim for her low back disability, is warranted.
