DATE: April 9, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to payment for a clothing allowance for the calendar year of 2020 for a back brace is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2005 to November 2006.

In the February 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Clothing Allowance

The Veteran's VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement states he is appealing a denial of clothing allowance for the year 2020. His VA claims file also notes that he has been approved for clothing allowances for the years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The Veteran indicates that all previously granted clothing allowances were for the same kind of back brace. 

Unfortunately, the record is missing a significant amount of documentation concerning a clothing allowance for calendar year 2020. Missing are relevant documents from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) including prior clothing allowance decisions, notices of disagreement, statements of the case, substantive appeals, and medical assessments conducted by VHA evaluators for the clothing allowance claims.

In addition, the Veteran's representative contends that they never received a copy of the January 2021 denial letter. Upon review of the denial letter, it does not indicate that it was sent to the Veteran's representative. Therefore, a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error has been committed.

As there are pertinent documents are missing from the file, the Board does not have a complete record on which basis it can fulfill its statutory and regulatory duty to render a decision on the Veteran's claim. Further, the Veteran's representative did not receive notice of the denial for a clothing allowance for the calendar year of 2020 for a back brace. Therefore, remand is warranted for the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), here VHA, to reconstruct the record and associate with the claims file all relevant clothing allowance records and to provide a copy of the determination letter to the Veteran's representative.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the electronic claims file all evidence related to the Veteran's clothing allowance claims, specifically for the calendar year 2020. The record should include, but is not limited to, prior clothing allowance decisions, notice of disagreements, statement of the cases, substantive appeals, and medical assessments conducted by VHA evaluators for the clothing allowance claims.

If any such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the Veteran and her representative notice of the unavailability of the records.

2. Issue the Veteran and his representative a notice of decision on the issue of entitlement to a clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year due to use of a back brace, as described in 38 U.S.C. §5104(b). The notice shall include, but is not limited to: a summary of the evidence; a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; identification of findings favorable to the claimant; and identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial (if the claim remains denied).
