ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to January 18, 2020 for special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound criteria being met is denied.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 30, 2022 for the increased rating of 100 percent for the service-connected posttraumatic stress with depressive disorder and traumatic brain injury (hereinafter referred to as PTSD) is denied. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 29, 2020 for the grant of service connection for bilateral tinnitus is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is in receipt of SMC under the housebound criteria since January 18, 2020, which is the earliest possible effective date allowed by applicable regulations. 

2. The Veteran filed a Statement in Support of Claim on September 30, 2022, requesting an increase rating for PTSD, and there is no factually ascertainable date one year prior to September 30, 2022 on which an increase in disability occurred.

3. In a February 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for bilateral tinnitus from July 22, 2021; however, the Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim on December 29, 2020, prior to the current effective date of July 22, 2021, which constitutes the original claim for service connection; additionally, the Veteran claims that he experienced bilateral tinnitus prior to December 29, 2020.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of SMC based on housebound criteria being met from January 18, 2020, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 3.352, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 30, 2022 for the increased rating of 100 percent for the service-connected PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 29, 2020 for the grant of service connection for bilateral tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from April 1999 to April 2007.

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), creates a new framework of review for veterans disagreeing with VA's decision on their claim. This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2022 AMA rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), previously referred to as the Regional Office (RO). The AOJ granted the claims for increased rating at 100 percent for the service-connected PTSD from September 30, 2022 and entitlement to SMC based on the housebound criteria being met from September 30, 2022. The AOJ denied the claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to July 22, 2021 for the grant of service connection for bilateral tinnitus. The Veteran filed a Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review in January 2024, requesting review of the effective dates for the Veteran's PTSD, SMC, and bilateral tinnitus. 

In a January 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision, the AOJ denied the claims for entitlement to earlier effective dates for PTSD, SMC, and bilateral tinnitus. 

While these issues were on appeal, in a February 2025 rating decision, the AOJ, in part, granted SMC based on housebound criteria being met from January 18, 2020. The AOJ should not have adjudicated the SMC issue as it was a pending appeal at the Board. However, any benefit granted to the Veteran in the spurious rating decision is binding on the Board.

In June 2024, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182) and requested Direct Review by the Board. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Legal Authority for Earlier Effective Date

According to applicable law and regulation, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based upon an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Prior to March 24, 2015, a "claim" was either a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  "Date of receipt" of a claim, information, or evidence means the date on which a claim, information, or evidence was received by VA.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  Any documented communication from, or action by, a veteran indicating intent to apply for a benefit under laws administered by VA may be considered an informal claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim.  See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992). 

Effective March 24, 2015, however, all claims must be submitted on a form prescribed by the Secretary of VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

The date of entitlement to an award of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

The general rule for claims for increased ratings is that the award is effective the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1). An exception to that rule provides that the effective date of an award of an increase shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if application is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to January 18, 2020 for special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound criteria being met is denied.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), special monthly compensation may be granted if the veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total, and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or, (2) by reason of such veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is permanently housebound. Id. 

The Veteran has already been assigned SMC under the housebound criteria from January 18, 2020. This is the earliest possible date of SMC under the facts of this case. From January 18, 2020, the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent total disability rating for compensation purposes due to individual unemployability (TDIU) based on the single service-connected disability of PTSD and he is also in receipt a 60 percent rating for additional service-connected disabilities in both shoulders, lumbar spine, both knees, right ankle, and chronic gastritis, which are separate and distinct from the TDIU rating.

Neither the Veteran nor his counsel offered specific evidence or argument to support the assignment of an earlier effective date of SMC. The appeal is denied.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 30, 2022 for the increased rating of 100 percent for the service-connected posttraumatic stress with depressive disorder and traumatic brain injury (hereinafter referred to as PTSD) is denied. 

As an initial matter, in the  December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to an increased rating of 100 percent for the service-connected PTSD from September 30, 2022, the date the claim for increase was filed. See September 2022 Statement in Support of Claim. The date that VA received the Statement in Support of Claim is the earliest possible date for an increased rating, unless the increase occurred during the one-year period prior to the filing of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Therefore, the Board will consider whether the increased rating can be granted as early as September 30, 2021.

However, after a thorough review of the Veteran's VA and private treatment records, the Board finds that there is no factually ascertainable date from September 30, 2021 and prior to September 30, 2022, in which the Veteran's PTSD worsened. The increased ratings were based on the October 2022 VA PTSD examination and November 2022 VA Residuals of Traumatic Brain Injury examination. Unfortunately, there is no evidence during the one-year look-back period that supports an increased rating prior to September 30, 2022. As such, entitlement to an earlier effective date for the increased rating for PTSD is denied. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 29, 2020 for the grant of service connection for bilateral tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran is in receipt of a 10 percent rating for the service-connected bilateral tinnitus from July 22, 2021. The Veteran generally requests an earlier effective date.

By way of procedural history, the Veteran filed an original claim for service connection in July 2007, which was denied in an October 2007 rating decision. The Veteran filed another claim for service connection in September 2018, which was deferred in a December 2018 rating decision and denied in a February 2019 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal those rating decisions, and they became final.

In a February 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for bilateral tinnitus from July 22, 2021; however, the Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim on December 29, 2020, prior to the current effective date of July 22, 2021 based on the filing of a Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. The Fully Developed Claim filed on December 29, 2020 is the original date of claim for service connection.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 29, 2020 for the grant of service connection for bilateral tinnitus have been met.
