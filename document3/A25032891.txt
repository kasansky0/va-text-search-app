DOCKET NO. 240513-439512
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his current tinnitus is related to his military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Tinnitus was incurred in active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1986 to January 1989.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in May 2024 VA Form 10182 and elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  Nevertheless, the decision herein constitutes a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal.

Law and Analysis

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  As organic diseases of the nervous system (including and tinnitus) are considered to be chronic diseases for VA compensation purposes, if chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); see also Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015) (adding tinnitus as an "organic disease of the nervous system" to the list of disabilities explicitly recognized as "chronic" in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a)).

In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including organic diseases of the nervous system (including tinnitus), are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to service connection for tinnitus.

The AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus. See May 2023, July 2023, and August 2023 rating decisions. Findings identified as favorable in an AOJ decision are binding on subsequent adjudicators, including the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104 (b)(4); 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). 

The Veteran's service treatment records do not document any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of tinnitus.  A January 2023 VA examiner also opined that the current disorder was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure because his military occupational specialty (MOS) has a low probability of hazardous noise exposure, he did not serve in combat, and there was no documentation to support the claim.  

Nevertheless, the Veteran is competent to report the onset and symptoms of tinnitus. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2).  In fact, the Court has specifically held that tinnitus is a type of disorder capable of lay observation and description. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002). Furthermore, there is no reason to doubt the credibility of his lay assertions other than a lack of contemporaneous evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The January 2023 VA examination report shows that the Veteran reported the disorder had its onset during his first year of military service after qualification exercises and that his tinnitus is constant and has become more noticeable.  There is no evidence to refute that statement.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that there is at least a reasonable doubt as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset in service.  Thus, resolving any reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board concludes that service connection is warranted for the disorder.
