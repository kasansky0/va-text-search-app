ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 13, 2017, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), is denied.  

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to October 13, 2017, the Veteran maintained a substantially gainful occupation. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to October 13, 2017, for the grant of a TDIU, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to April 1988.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In March 2024, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement and selected the Direct Review docket. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Total Disability Rating Based on Individual Unemployability (TDIU)

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3)disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018).

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. 

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment. Marginal employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. Marginal employment may also be held to exist in some cases when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold, such as when employment is in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop. Id. 

The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Id. Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id. 

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) recently defined the phrase "employment in a protected environment" as used in § 4.16(a) to mean "employment in a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024). The Court further noted "of course, the income that a veteran earns from employment must be relatively low to qualify as in a protected environment." Id. at 30. 

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, such as their history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether a veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Id.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU. 

The Veteran contends the evidence supports an effective date prior to October 13, 2017, for the grant of TDIU. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran asserts his chronic pain and mobility issues, caused by service-connected back and knee disabilities, have impacted his ability to work due to difficulty with prolonged walking, standing, and sitting. See November 2022 Statement. 

In this instance, the AOJ granted entitlement to TDIU effective October 13, 2017, the date immediately following his last reported date of employment. See April 2023 Rating Decision. 

A claim for TDIU is essentially a claim for an increased rating, with the effective date of the grant of such a claim awarded as of the earliest date it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred, if the claim is received within one year of that date; otherwise, the effective date of the award is the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Here, the Veteran has continuously pursued the TDIU claim at issue since its filing on January 10, 2018. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), 3.2500(h). Thus, the review period on appeal begins January 10, 2017.  

Prior to February 3, 2017, the Veteran's combined rating was 40 percent. Therefore, the Veteran did not meet the schedular criteria for a TDIU. From February 3, 2017, the Veteran's combined rating was 80 percent, and he had at least one disability rated as 40 percent disabling. Therefore, the Veteran met the schedular criteria for a TDIU. However, as discussed below, a TDIU is not warranted on a schedular or extraschedular basis. 

The Board notes it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review. This includes October 2017 to November 2017 VA treatment records, January 2018 TDIU claim form, February 2018 PTSD VA examination, January 2019 TDIU claim form, February 2020 to April 2020 Social Security Administration (SSA) records, January 2022 hearing transcript, March 2022 private vocational opinion, and November 2022 statement.

Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record. 

Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim. See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). As detailed below, the Board finds the evidence does not support an effective date prior to October 13, 2017, for the grant of TDIU.

The Veteran has a 15-to-20-year work history as a plumber and owned his own plumbing company for several years. He has consistently reported that he maintained such employment until October 12, 2017, at which time he retired due to his service-connected disabilities. 

In October 2017, the Veteran was seen in the emergency department for knee pain after injuring his left knee stepping out of a high truck. The provider noted he was employed as a plumber at that time. The Veteran stated in his January 2018 TDIU claim form that he last worked full-time on October 12, 2017, and then became too disabled to work.

During his February 2018 PTSD VA examination, the Veteran reported he stopped working in October 2017, after falling out of a tow truck and injuring his knees. In the January 2019 TDIU claim form, the Veteran listed his last date of full-time employment as October 12, 2017, and became too disabled to work after that date. In April 2020, SSA records note the Veteran reported a 15-year work history as a self-employed plumber, with an unemployment date of October 13, 2017.  

During his January 2022 testimony, the Veteran reported he last worked on October 12, 2017, due to injuring his knee falling out of a tow truck. The March 2022 private vocational opinion states that the Veteran contends his service-connected disabilities prevented him from maintaining gainful employment as of November 14, 2017. The private examiner opined the Veteran's "service-connected impairments from this time period rendered him unable to work by his contested date of November 14, 2017." Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence of record clearly demonstrates the Veteran continued to work as a self-employed plumber until October 13, 2017. 

As detailed above, marginal employment is found when a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

In his January 2018 TDIU claim form, the Veteran reported self-employment as a plumber from January 2012 to October 2017, working 10 to 13 hours per week. His highest gross earnings were $2,000 per month. In his January 2019 TDIU claim form, the Veteran reported self-employment as a plumber from 2007 to 2017, working 20 hours per week. He was "not sure" of his highest gross earnings per month. 

The Veteran also provided employment and earnings information to the SSA in his February 2020 disability benefits application. He reported working as a plumber eight hours per day, five days per week earning $8.00 per hour from January 1988 to October 2017, amounting to gross monthly earnings of $1,386.67. The Board will, therefore, utilize the earnings reported to the SSA in its analysis of the poverty threshold as this evidence is most favorable to the Veteran's claim. 

The most recent published poverty thresholds for 2017 (the year the Veteran became unemployed) reflect a poverty level for one individual under 65 years of age at an annual income of $12,752, which equates to $1,062.67 per month. See http://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html (last visited April 4, 2025). The Veteran's monthly income at $1,386.67, therefore, exceeds the poverty threshold for a single individual.   

The Board has also considered whether the Veteran's employment was within a protected or sheltered environment. The Veteran completed four years of high school education and vocational training as a plumber. He worked as a plumber or in similar fields from 1988, following discharge from service, until his retirement in October 2017. 

While the Veteran has been self-employed for the last several years, he did so through starting and running his own plumbing company with a business partner. This employment is consistent with his education, vocational training as a plumber, and prior work history and is not demonstrative of a position protected from competition in the employment market. LaBruzza, supra. Moreover, the persuasive weight of the evidence does not indicate the Veteran was earning relatively low income during this period such that he would be eligible for consideration for a TDIU on that basis. Id.

The Board, therefore, concludes the competent and credible evidence of record persuasively weighs against an effective date prior to October 13, 2017, as the Veteran maintained substantial gainful employment prior to that date. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). As such, entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU is denied.
