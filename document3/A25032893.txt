FINDINGS OF FACT

1.   The Veteran filed an intent to file on June 7, 2017; he subsequently submitted an Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526EZ) for service connection for PTSD as well as an increased rating for headaches that received at the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) on July 15, 2017.  

2.   An April 21, 2020 rating decision awarded service connection for PTSD and assigned a 50 percent rating, effective June 7, 2017; the AOJ also awarded a 50 percent rating for headaches, effective June 7, 2017.  

3.   On April 18, 2022, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) for TDIU and the Veteran was seeking review of the April 2020 rating decision.  

4.   In an April 2022 correspondence, the Veteran's attorney requested that the Veteran's April 2022 VA Form 20-0995 be considered timely under the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) time limit extension.  

5.   The August 2022 rating decision awarded entitlement to TDIU and Dependents' Educational Assistance, assigning an effective date of April 18, 2022 for each.  

6.   The Veteran has continuously pursued the claim of entitlement to a TDIU since June 7, 2017 and he has met the requirements for entitlement to a TDIU beginning on June 7, 2017.  

7.   Based on the award of TDIU beginning on June 7, 2017, the Veteran met the basic eligibility requirements for Dependents' Educational Assistance as of that date.  

8.   Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's PTSD manifested as occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas without total occupational and social impairment.  

9.   A July 2013 legacy rating decision denied the claims of entitlement for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus as the conditions were neither occurred in nor were caused by service; the Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement and a statement of the case was issued in October 2014, but a timely substantive appeal was not filed.  

10.   New evidence was not received after the July 2013 legacy rating decision that is relevant to the issues of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  

11.   The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea did not have its onset during active service and is not etiologically related to service.  

12.   The Veteran's hypoxemic respiratory failure did not have its onset in service and is not etiologically related to service.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from February 1972 to February 1974.  

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions dated in July 2022 and May 2023 issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The rating decisions on appeal constitute an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In April 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claims for an increased rating for PTSD and entitlement to a TDIU most recently addressed in an April 2020 rating decision and a May 2021 rating decision, respectively. In July 2022, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In April 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2021 rating decision and a June 2021 rating decision as to the issues of new and relevant evidence to readjudicate claims for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus as well as service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, hypoxemic respiratory failure and essential tremors of the upper extremities. In July 2022, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2021 and June 2021 rating decisions.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2021 and June 2021 rating decisions as to these issues.

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, and requested review of an August 2022 decision seeking an increased rating for PTSD as well as earlier effective dates for the award of TDIU and Dependents' Education Assistance.  In May 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2022 rating decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 rating decision.

In the May 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2021 and June 2021 rating decisions as to the issues of new and relevant evidence to readjudicate claims for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus as well as service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, hypoxemic respiratory failure and essential tremors of the upper extremities, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. In addition, may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 rating decision as to the issues seeking an increased rating for PTSD as well as earlier effective dates for the award of TDIU and Dependents' Education Assistance, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301 If evidence were submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for upper extremities essential tremor, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  

With respect to the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for a neurological disorder, including essential tremor of the upper extremities, the Board notes that the AOJ adjudicated the Veteran's claim on the merits despite the fact that the same claim was previously denied in an August 2018 rating decision.  Consequently, it appears that the AOJ implicitly found that new and relevant evidence was received to warrant readjudication of such claim.  Under the AMA, the Board is bound by such favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Earlier Effective Date Criteria

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

An exception to that rule provides that the effective date of an award of an increase shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if application is received within one year from such date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).  If the increase occurred more than a year prior to the claim, the effective date shall be the date of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  Finally, if the increase occurs after the claim is filed, the effective date shall be the date the increase occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126-27 (1997).  

Moreover, under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the notice of a decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, continuous pursuit can be established by filing a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995), request a higher-level review (VA Form 20-0996), or appeal to the Board of Appeals (VA Form 10182).  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1).  

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of doubt is afforded the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  

1.  Entitlement to an effective date of June 7, 2017, but no earlier, for the award of entitlement to a TDIU, is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date for TDIU beginning in June 2017 when he initially filed a claim for service connection for PTSD, which was eventually granted.  The Veteran's attorney noted that, in the Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (VA Form 21-8940), the Veteran reported that he essentially left the workforce in 2017 because his symptoms resulted in isolation and lack of motivation, such that he missed a lot of work. See February 2023 VA Form 20-0996.  

As it pertains to effective dates, TDIU earlier effective date claims are not regulated by their own specific subsection of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Rather, such TDIU claims are equivalent to increased rating earlier effective date claims, and thus are governed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).  

The effective date for an award of an increased rating (including TDIU) will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If the increase is factually ascertainable within one year prior to the receipt of the claim for an increased rating, the rating will be effective as of the date of increase; however, if the increase occurred more than one year prior to the receipt of the claim, the increase will be effective on the date of the claim.  In addition, if the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date will be the date of increase.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown,10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1), (2).  

For purposes of effective date rules, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU may be considered as part of a claim for underlying benefits (i.e., the service connection claim) or may be considered part of an increased compensation claim (i.e., in conjunction with an increased evaluation claim or as a freestanding claim to obtain an increased evaluation based on unemployability).  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009) (stating that a claim for individual unemployability benefits "involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability or disabilities, either as part of the initial adjudication of a claim or, if a disability upon which entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability is based has already been found to be service connected, as part of a claim for increased compensation"; see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 32-34 (2007) (noting that an award of individual unemployability may not amount to award of increased compensation where individual unemployability is awarded as part of initial award of disability compensation benefits)).  

To establish entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities, there must be impairment so severe that it is impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  38 U.S.C. § 1555; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability."  Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).  Consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to her age or to the impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19 (2021); Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).  

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" has been interpreted to consist of two components: one economic and one noneconomic. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 7274 (2019). The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the United States Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. at 73.

The regulatory scheme for a TDIU provides both objective and subjective criteria.  Hatlestad at 529.  The objective criteria, set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), provide for a TDIU when, due to a service-connected disability, a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, and has a single disability rated 60 percent or more, or at least one disability 40 percent or more with additional disability sufficient to bring the combined evaluation to 70 percent.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).  In exceptional circumstances, where the veteran does not meet the aforementioned percentage requirements, a total rating may nonetheless be assigned upon a showing that the individual is unable to obtain or retain substantially gainful employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  

Even where the record reflects that a veteran has been employed during a given period, TDIU may still be available where it is shown that employment was marginal.  Marginal employment is not considered "substantially gainful." Employment is generally considered marginal when a veteran's earned income does not exceed the amount established by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for an individual. It may also be held to exist on a 'facts found' basis, including where employment is sheltered, or protected in a family environment, or where other unique circumstances arise rendering employment less than substantially gainful, even if a veteran's earned income exceeds the poverty threshold.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  

Here, although the Veteran filed VA a Form 21-8940 on April 18, 2022, the AOJ granted a TDIU with an effective date of April 12, 2021, which was the date the Veteran filed an increased rating claim for service connected PTSD.  See April 28, 2021 VA 21-526EZ; April 12, 2021 Intent to file. Therefore, the AOJ treated the earlier filing as an implicit claim for a TDIU. See August 25, 2022 rating decision.  

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record prior to April 12, 2021 to determine if the Veteran filed a formal claim, an informal claim, or expressed a written intent to file a claim for a TDIU or an increased rating during that time.  The record shows that the Veteran submitted a written intent to file a claim on April 12, 2021. Within one year of that date, he filed a formal increased rating claim for PTSD to include alcohol abuse. Consequently, the Board finds that the Veteran's TDIU claim is part and parcel of his underlying increased rating claim submitted on April 12, 2021.  Rice v. Shinseki, supra.  As the Veteran's inferred TDIU claim was filed within one year of the intent to file, he preserved the earlier date the intent to file was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  

However, it is contended that the Veteran's claim for TDIU was continuously pursued, and that an earlier effective date for entitlement to a TDIU is warranted.  

Significantly, the record indicates that the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim on June 7, 2017. Within one year of that date, in July 2017, he filed formal claim for service connection for PTSD and an increased rating claim for headaches via a VA Form 526EZ.  In an April 2018 statement in support of claim, the Veteran indicated that he suffers from chronic severe depression and anxiety and the increased frequency of his migraines have contributed to his psychiatric condition.  He further noted that, after a migraine, he is left feeling anxious with suicidal thoughts and he was basically incapacitated going through migraine episodes that he could do nothing but seclude himself in his room in total darkness.  

Following a February 2020 VA examination, the examiner confirmed a diagnosis of chronic headaches.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran can't work during migraine attacks as pain is severe and so sensitive to light. Following a VA examination in March 2020, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's PTSD resulted in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  

An April 21, 2020 rating decision awarded service connection for PTSD and assigned a 50 percent rating, effective June 7, 2017; the AOJ also granted a 50 percent rating for headaches, effective June 7, 2017.  The Veteran had a combined rating of 80 percent, effective June 7, 2017.  

On April 18, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA form 20-0995 for TDIU seeking review of the April 2020 rating decision.  In an April 2022 correspondence, the Veteran's attorney requested that the Veteran's April 2022 VA Form 20-0995 be considered timely under the COVID-19 time limit extension.  The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) issued Policy Letter 20-02, Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Claims and Appeals Processing Guidance (PL 20-02) in response to the national COVID-19 outbreak emergency.  In general, PL 20-02 provided that the COVID-19 global pandemic was considered a good cause basis for VA to grant extensions of time limits to submit certain documents/responses or if a claimant did not report for a hearing or scheduled examination and requested to reschedule.  

PL 20-02 advised that effective March 1, 2020, if a claimant or a claimant's authorized representative requested an extension of a time limit associated with a required action based on the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, the filing of a response to a proposed adverse action, VBA would grant the requests under the good cause provisions, provided the time limit would have expired or situation occurred on or after March 1, 2020.  

Effective March 1, 2020, if a claimant or authorized representative requests an extension of a time limit associated with a required action or notes their inability to attend a virtual hearing or tele-C&P examination based on the COVID-19 pandemic, VBA will grant these requests under the good cause provisions, provided the time limit would have expired or situation occurred on or after March 1, 2020 and until 60 calendar days from the date the President ends the national state of emergency.  

In this case, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 in April 2022. The Board notes, however, that the deadline for filing an appeal of the April 2020 rating decision was April 2021. This falls directly within the time period to allow for an extension of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under these circumstances, it is shown that the Veteran has continuously pursued the claim of entitlement to a TDIU since the claim was first raised on June 7, 2017.  Accordingly, June 7, 2017 is the date of claim.

A TDIU rating may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Disabilities of one or both lower extremities, disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident, and disabilities affecting a single body system (e.g., orthopedic) will be considered one disability for the purpose of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  

Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran was service connected for PTSD with alcohol use disorder, rated as 50 percent disabling as of June 7, 2017 and 70 percent disabling as of April 12, 2021; and chronic headaches, rated as 50 percent disabling as of June 7, 2017. The Veteran's combined rating was 80 percent beginning on June 7, 2017 and 90 percent beginning on April 12, 2021. Therefore, the Veteran met the schedular requirements for TDIU from the June 7, 2017 date of claim.  

With regards the economic component of TDIU, the Veteran reported that he had a high school education and that his past work experience included refinery maintenance. He reported that he stopped working in 2017. See April 2022 VA Form 21-8940.

With regards to the noneconomic component of a TDIU, a September 2017 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's headache condition did not impact his ability to work. During a subsequent VA examination in March 2020, the examiner indicated that the Veteran cannot work during migraine attacks as pain is severe and he is sensitive to light.  A July 2015 VA examination noted that the Veteran reported reduced ability to perform work or normal activities during migraine headache episodes that require lying down in a dark room for partial symptoms relief.  Following a June 2016 VA examination, the examiner indicated that the Veteran has been unable to work due to weekly severe prostrating headaches.  The Veteran also submitted March 2017 private Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) report wherein the provider noted that the Veteran had daily headaches, and due to the severity of those headaches, he is unable to perform any kind of work.  During a November 2017 psychological consultation, it was noted that the Veteran last worked full time in 2008; he was working two days per week because he feels that helping other veterans also helps him.  During a primary care visit in April 2018, the Veteran indicated that his migraines were occurring more often and lasting longer; he stated that they lasts hours and he must stay in a dark and quiet area.  

The clinical and lay evidence of record suggests that the Veteran is rendered unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected chronic headaches and PTSD throughout the period on appeal.  Given the degree of impairment caused by symptoms associated with the Veteran's service-connected chronic headaches and PTSD, and the nature of the Veteran's employment, educational history, and experience, it is reasonably shown that the symptoms associated with the Veteran's service connected chronic headaches and PTSD rendered him unemployable during the pendency of this appeal.  The possibility that the Veteran could engage in some form of employment was considered.  However, multiple examination reports indicate that the Veteran's chronic headaches and PTSD have had a significant effect on his employability; thus, it is reasonably shown that the Veteran was unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due to symptoms associated with his service connected chronic headaches and PTSD.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that an effective date of June 7, 2017, but no earlier, is warranted for the award of a TDIU.  To that extent, the appeal is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.  

2.  Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 12, 2021 for the award of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is denied.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.  

For the purposes of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the child or surviving spouse of a veteran will have basic eligibility if: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a), 21.3021.  

In general, effective dates relating to awards under Chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 of Title 38 U.S.C. or Chapter 106 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 5113.  

Here, the Board is granting an effective date of June 7, 2017 for entitlement to a TDIU herein. Therefore, an effective date of June 7, 2017 for entitlement to Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits is also warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510.  

An effective date earlier than June 7, 2017 is not warranted as the combined rating was less than 100 percent.  Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits may not be awarded prior to the effective date of an award for a permanent and total disability rating.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510.  As the Veteran was not awarded a permanent and total rating prior to June 7, 2017, no earlier effective date may be granted.  

Therefore, the Board finds that an effective date of June 7, 2017, but no earlier, for the award of Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits is warranted in this case.  To that extent, the appeal is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.2, 4.10. 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38?C.F.R. §?4.7. Reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38?C.F.R. §?4.3. It is permissible to switch diagnostic codes to reflect more accurately a claimant's current symptoms. Read v. Shinseki, 651 F. 3d 1296, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2011). 

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Although a rating specialist is directed to review the recorded history of a disability in order to make a more accurate evaluation, see 38?C.F.R. §?4.2, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings. Francisco v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?55 (1994). 

Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38?C.F.R. §?4.21. Therefore, the Board has considered the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the veteran, as well as the entire history of the veteran's disability in reaching its decision. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589, 595 (1991). 

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38?C.F.R. §?4.25. Pyramiding, the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when rating a veteran's service-connected disability. 38?C.F.R. §?4.14. It is possible for a veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury which would permit rating under several diagnostic codes, however, the critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?259, 261-62 (1994).  

The basis of disability evaluation is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38?C.F.R. §?4.10. 

The veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by his senses. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38?C.F.R. §?3.159(a). 

Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no obligation to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence of record. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence). Therefore, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as it relates to the Veteran's claims. 

3.  Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD with alcohol use disorder is denied.

The Veteran generally contends that his PTSD is more disabling than reflected by the rating currently assigned.  In an April 2022 submission, the Veteran's representative asserted that a higher rating was warranted as the Veteran displayed total occupational impairment.  

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran is rated 70 percent for PTSD with alcohol use disorder. 38?C.F.R. §?4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.  

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages.  Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating.  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130; Diagnostic Code 9411.  

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.  Id.  

The Board notes that with regard to the use of the phrase "such as" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 (General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders), ratings are assigned according to the manifestations of particular symptoms.  However, the use of the phrase "such as" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve only as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating.  Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).  Accordingly, the evidence considered in determining the level of impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is not restricted to the symptoms provided in the Diagnostic Code.  Instead, VA must consider all symptoms of a claimant's condition that affect the level of occupational and social impairment.  

Turning to the evidence of record, a May 2021 VA examination report reflected the Veteran's reports of feeling depressed more days than not; he stated that he tries to distract himself from feeling depressed but struggles with selfcare.  The Veteran noted that his sleep is disrupted by nightmares.  The Veteran reported feeling down because of his medical difficulties which cause limitations that he never had before.  The Veteran indicated that he lives alone and that he has two living siblings, children and grandchildren but he does not see them often.  The Veteran reported spending time with his grandchildren, spending time mostly at home watching television.  The Veteran also reported having a girlfriend, but he doesn't see her often because he prefers to be alone.  The Veteran indicated that he stopped working 18 months ago; he stated that he worked in counseling and left because working with Veterans started to get stressful and he had difficulty managing his temper.  

The examiner reported that the pertinent diagnoses were PTSD, alcohol use disorder, and major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate; the examiner indicated that the diagnoses are not independent of each other.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder is manifested by depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks more than once a week, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of short and long term memory, flattened affect, impaired judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, suicidal ideation, impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence, and neglect of personal appearance and hygiene.  On mental status examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran was wearing sunglasses due to recent glaucoma surgery; he was guarded but cooperative.  It was also noted that his temper had gotten worse, he was more irritable and is bothered by people for no reason, even his grandkids are getting on his nerves.  The examiner also noted that the Veteran is hypervigilant, suspicious, and can't relax; he also has trouble with memory and concentration.  He denied any thoughts or intent to self-harm.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran identified as now acute risk for suicide with no current suicidal intent or plan.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's mental disorder resulted in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  

During a subsequent VA examination in July 2022, the Veteran reported that he was divorced and lives alone; however, he also stated that he was currently in an intimate relationship and that this relationship is going well.  The Veteran also reported that he has three adult children, and he has a good relationship with his children; he also has a fairly good relationship with his siblings.  He has one friend who lives close by, and with whom he socializes.  The Veteran indicated that he lives for his grandchildren, and he has been recently refocusing back to church.  It was noted that the Veteran was not employed, and he has not worked since his last examination in 2021.  The examiner noted that the current diagnoses were PTSD and alcohol use disorder, severe; the examiner stated that there is a clinical association between these conditions in that his alcohol use is mainly to self-medicate his PTSD with depressed mood symptoms.  

The examiner indicated that the Veteran's disorder is manifested by depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, flattened affect, impaired judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, suicidal ideation, and impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence.  On examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran's demeanor and responsiveness to questions was cooperative.  His manner of relating and overall presentation was adequate.  His general appearance was same as his age.  His mode of dress was appropriate, and he was well-groomed.  His posture and motor behavior were normal.  His eye contact was appropriate.  His speech intelligibility was fluent albeit somewhat slurred with some stammering, and the quality of his voice was clear.  His receptive and expressive language skills were adequate.  His thought processes were coherent and goal-directed with no evidence of hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia in the evaluation setting.  His affect was flattened to dysphoric.  His mood was dysthymic.  His sensorium was clear.  His insight and judgement were poor at this time.  

The examiner noted that the Veteran is service connected for PTSD; however, it is now accompanied by depressed mood; the examiner also noted that the Veteran has a secondary diagnosis of severe alcohol use disorder.  The examiner indicated that, due to the Veteran's severe depression, sleeping disturbance, isolation and avoidance behaviors, his ability to maintain reasonable attendance at any job may be impaired; it was noted that he may need significant flex time in order to manage exacerbating symptoms.  The examiner explained that, due to his significant concentration and attention problems, short-term memory deficits, hypervigilance, and flashbacks, the Veteran may not be able to start, work on, and/or complete job-related tasks; he will need a job coach who will check in with him frequently throughout the day in order to keep him on task. In addition, he may need frequent breaks throughout the day to manage attentional drifting and increased anxiety symptoms.  The examiner further noted that, due to his irritability, hyper startled response, and hypervigilance, the Veteran may not be able to work well with others; he may need to work in a solitary job and in a stimulus reduced environment.  The examiner observed suicide risk level is low acute; significantly, he denied current suicide ideation and homicide ideation; however, he occasionally has passive suicide ideation without plan or intent the last of which occurred a few days ago.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's PTSD resulted in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a higher 100 percent rating is not warranted as total social and occupational impairment has not been demonstrated.  While the Veteran indicated that he was divorced, he reported being in an intimate relationship and that this relationship is going well; he also reported having a good relationship with his children and his siblings and that he has a friend with whom he socializes. Such does not result in total social impairment. There is no evidence or allegation that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms manifested in interference or difficulties resulted in the inability to perform activities of daily life, to include maintenance of minimal hygiene. During the July 2022 VA examination, the examiner noted that his mode of dress was appropriate, and he was well-groomed.  The Board notes that while the Veteran has reported passive suicidal ideations throughout the appeal there is no indication that the Veteran attempted suicide or that he experienced homicidal ideations or attempts; such does not result in the Veteran being in persistent danger of hurting himself or others. Moreover, the Veteran has not alleged, and the record has not shown, spatial disorientation, gross impairment in thought process or communication, persistent delusions, grossly inappropriate behavior, a persistent danger of hurting self and others disorientation to time or place and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name. Therefore, a 100 percent rating for PTSD with alcohol use disorder is not warranted.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contentions that his PTSD with alcohol use disorder is more severe than evaluated.  The Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and has presented credible statements in this regard.  See Layno v. Brown, supra.  The Board finds, however, that neither the Veteran's statement nor medical evidence demonstrates that the criteria for a higher rating have been met.  The Board also acknowledges that the Veteran's VA treatment records note complaints of and treatment for his PTSD with alcohol use disorder.  However, these records do not address the specific rating criteria necessary to determine severity.  In determining the actual degree of disability, the examination findings are more probative of the degree of impairment.  

The Board has considered whether a staged rating under Hart v. Mansfield, supra is appropriate; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology had been stable throughout the period on appeal. Therefore, assigning a staged rating is not warranted.  The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record in regard to the increased rating claim adjudicated herein.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28?Vet. App.?366 (2017). 

VA's duty to maximize benefits requires it to assess all of a claimant's service connected disabilities to determine whether any combination of the disabilities establishes eligibility for special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). In Bradley, the Court held that 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) permits a TDIU rating based on a single disability to satisfy the statutory requirement of a "total" rating. When a veteran is awarded TDIU based on a single disability and receives schedular disability ratings for other conditions, special monthly compensation based on the statutory housebound criteria may be awarded so long as the same disability is not counted twice, i.e., as a basis for TDIU and as a separate disability rated 60 percent or more disabling. See 75 Fed. Reg. 11,229, 11,230; Summary of Precedent Opinions of the VA General Counsel (March 10, 2010) (withdrawing VAOPGCPREC 6-1999 in light of Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 280).

A veteran with a 100 percent schedular rating for a single service-connected disability could also obtain a TDIU on a single separate disability (though not on multiple service-connected disabilities), in order to meet the special monthly compensation requirements (100 percent rating plus 60 percent rating). A TDIU could meet the special monthly compensation requirements by either: a) increasing a single disability rating of less than 60 percent to at least 60 percent (in a case where a separate 100 percent rating is already established), or b) increasing a single disability that is less than 100 percent to a "total" (100 percent) rating, in a case where there is already established a combination of other ratings that meet the separate 60 percent rating requirement for special monthly compensation. See Buie at 249-50. The Veteran has been awarded a TDIU based on the combined effects of his service connected PTSD with alcohol use disorder and chronic headaches throughout the period on appeal and he does not have service connected disabilities that are separately rated as 60 percent disabling. Therefore, special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) for statutory housebound benefits is not warranted.

According, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD with alcohol use disorder is not warranted.  The appeal is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.  

New and Relevant Evidence Criteria

Generally, when a claim in the former legacy appeals system is disallowed, it may not be reopened and allowed, and a claim based on the same factual basis may not be considered.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  Under the legacy appeals system, a claim on which there is a prior, final and binding decision may be reopened if new and material evidence is submitted.  38 U.S.C. § 5108.  

Prior unappealed legacy rating decisions may not be reopened absent the submission of new and material evidence warranting revision of the previous decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156. New evidence means evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers. Material evidence means evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, related to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).

Material evidence is: (1) evidence on an element where the claimant initially failed to submit any competent evidence; (2) evidence on an element where the previously submitted evidence was found to be insufficient; (3) evidence on an element where the appellant did not have to submit evidence until a decision of the Secretary determined that an evidentiary presumption had been rebutted; or (4) some combination or variation of the above three situations. Kent v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 1 (2006).

In order to be new and material evidence, the evidence must not be cumulative or redundant, and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim, which has been found to be enabling, not preclusive. See Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110 (2010). When determining whether the claim should be reopened, the credibility of the newly submitted evidence is to be presumed. Justus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 (1991).

When VA fails to consider new and material evidence submitted within the one-year appeal period pursuant to § 3.156(b), and that evidence establishes entitlement to the benefit sought, the underlying AOJ decision does not become final. Young v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 461, 466 (2009); see also Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 252 (2011) (remanding for the Board to consider the application of 38 C.F.R.                § 3.156(b) and whether the regional office correctly viewed the statements in question as new claims). That is, when statements are received within one year of the rating decision, the Board's inquiry is not limited to whether those statements constitute notices of disagreement but whether those statements include the submission of new and material evidence under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the creation of VA treatment records containing new and material evidence within one year of a legacy decision may vitiate the finality of that decision, without regard to whether VA adjudicators are notified of the existence of these records within one year of the issuance of that decision. See Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).  Relevant evidence is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  As the statutory definition of relevant does not require that the evidence relate to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim or raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim, new and relevant evidence is a lower standard than the new and material evidence standard.  

4.  New and relevant evidence not having been received, readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

5.  New and relevant evidence not having been received, readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus were denied in a rating decision issued in July 2013. The evidence considered at the time of the July 2013 rating decision included the Veteran's Certificate of Release from Active Duty (DD Form 214), the service treatment records, service personnel records and a VA audiological examination report. Significantly, the Veteran's DD Form 214 indicates that his military occupational specialty was that of Rifleman.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA audiology evaluation in June 2013. It was noted that pure tone testing revealed sensorineural hearing loss in the frequency range of 6000 Hertz or higher in the right ear, and sensorineural hearing loss in the frequency range of 500 Hertz to 4000 Hertz.  The examiner also noted that word recognition scores were 100 percent in the right ear and 96 percent in the left ear.  No abnormal acoustic reflex was noted. The examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure; the rationale was that the Veteran's hearing was within normal limits and no report of tinnitus was found in the service treatment records.  

A July 2013 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss as the evidence of record failed to show current audiometric findings which meet the criteria for a grant of service connection for hearing loss as the examination did not show a hearing loss for VA purposes in the right ear, and the evidence did not show a medical link between the left ear hearing loss and the Veteran's service and did not show a medical link between the tinnitus and the Veteran's service. The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement, and a statement of the case was issued in October 2014, but a timely substantive appeal was not filed. 

The Board has also considered the applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) as it appears that additional service records may have been received subsequent to the July 2013 rating decision. In this regard, such provides that, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of the same section (which defines new and material evidence). The regulation further identifies service records related to a claimed in-service event, injury, or disease as relevant service department records. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1)(i). As such, new and material evidence is not needed to reopen a previously denied claim when relevant service treatment records and/or any other relevant service department records are received after a prior final denial. Rather, the claim is simply reviewed on a de novo basis.

The Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records and service personnel records were received in April 2012. Additional service personnel records were associated with the record in October 2018. However, these additional service personnel records do not show that the Veteran has current bilateral hearing loss that was either occurred in or caused by service. Additional service treatment records were obtained after the July 2013 legacy rating decision and October 2014 statement of the case were duplicative or did not warrant reconsideration of the claims. 

Evidence received since the June 2013 rating decision and October 2014 statement of the case includes updated VA treatment records, various statements from the Veteran and additional service personnel records. However, such evidence is not both new and relevant to the Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. While the updated VA treatment records are new in that they were not previously considered, such is not relevant as it does not tend to prove or disprove a matter in issue. Significantly, the newly submitted treatment records do not reflect a diagnosis of right ear hearing loss for VA purposes and they also do not contain information that would tend to prove or disprove a relationship between the diagnosed hearing loss and/or tinnitus and the Veteran's service. In addition, the additional statements from the Veteran do not reflect a diagnosis of right ear hearing loss for VA purposes and they do not contain information that would tend to prove or disprove a relationship between the diagnosed hearing loss and/or tinnitus and the Veteran's service. Similarly, the additional service personnel records do not reflect a diagnosis of right ear hearing loss for VA purposes and they do not contain information that would tend to prove or disprove a relationship between the diagnosed hearing loss and/or tinnitus and the Veteran's service.

As new and relevant evidence was not received, readjudication of the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus are not warranted.  The appeals are denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.  

Service Connection Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"- the so-called "nexus" requirement."  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

The veteran can provide competent reports of factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, such as experiencing pain in service, reporting to sick call, being placed on limited duty, and undergoing physical therapy.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005).  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a lay person is competent to identify the medical condition (noting that sometimes the lay person will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer), (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Similarly, laypersons are competent to diagnose and provide nexus opinions to some extent, notably where the diagnosis or opinion is not of a complex nature.  Id., see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  

6.  Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is denied.

The Veteran generally contends that he developed obstructive sleep apnea as a result of service. See April 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ and April 2022 VA Form 20-0996.  Specific argument in support of this appeal has not been presented. A July 2022 rating decision made a favorable finding that the Veteran had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea; the Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

The Veteran's service treatment records are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to obstructive sleep apnea. The January 1974 service discharge examination found the Veteran's lungs to be normal.

Post-service treatment records reflect that the Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea by sleep study in June 2015; he subsequently received ongoing treatment for obstructive sleep apnea with continued use of continuous positive airway pressure machine. Additionally, the post service medical records do not show a competent diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea until June 2015, more than 16 years following Veteran's separation from military service.  The Board must note the lapse of many years between the Veteran's separation from service and the first diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has determined that such a lapse of time is a factor for consideration in deciding a service connection claim.  Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  

With regards to direct service connection, a May 2021 VA examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event or illness.  In this regard, the VA examiner explained that obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat relax. The examiner further explained these muscles support the soft palate, the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the palate (uvula), the tonsils, the side walls of the throat and the tongue. The examiner reasoned that when the muscles relax, your airway narrows or closes as you breathe in and you can't get enough air, which can lower the oxygen level in your blood. The examiner noted that your brain senses your inability to breathe, that this briefly rouses you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway and that this awakening is usually so brief that you don't remember it; you might snort, choke or gasp. The examiner noted that this pattern can repeat itself five to 30 times or more each hour, all night, impairing your ability to reach the deep, restful phases of sleep. The examiner concluded that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea that was incurred in or caused by respiratory treatment in service during service; she stated that respiratory treatments are not a cause of obstructive sleep apnea.  The examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data.  Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  There is no contrary opinion of record.  

In analyzing this claim, the Board did consider the Veteran's contentions that his obstructive sleep apnea is related to his service.  In this regard, a layperson is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994).  A lay person may speak to etiology in some limited circumstances in which nexus is obvious merely through observation, such as a fall leading to a broken leg.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, supra.  However, the question of causation or aggravation of obstructive sleep apnea involves a medical subject concerning an internal physical process extending beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship.  In this regard, such an opinion requires specialized knowledge of the respiratory system.  There is no indication that the Veteran possesses such specialized knowledge.  As such, the question of etiology in this case may not be competently addressed by lay evidence, and the Veteran's opinion regarding the etiology of his obstructive sleep apnea is non-probative evidence.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, supra; Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007).

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is not warranted.  The appeal is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.  

1.   Entitlement to service connection for hypoxemic respiratory failure is denied.

The Veteran generally contends that he has a respiratory condition that is related to service.  See April 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ and April 2022 VA Form 20-0996.  Specific argument in support of this appeal was not submitted.  In the July 2022 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran had been diagnosed with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; the Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Th Veteran's service treatment records show that the Veteran was seen in diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection in February 1972.  The service treatment records also show that the Veteran was brought into the clinic in November 1972 with complaints of passing out outside of the club on the right side with pain in the lower part of his rib cage; he also complained of light headedness on standing; no pertinent diagnosis was noted.  The January 1974 service discharge examination found the Veteran's lungs and chest to be normal and a chest X-ray was reported to be negative. 

While the record reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the earliest post-service documentation of a respiratory disorder was in February 2021, which is approximately 47 years after Veteran's separation from service.  The Court has determined that a significant lapse in time between service and post-service medical treatment may be considered as part of the analysis of a service connection claim.  See generally Maxson v. Gober, supra. 

With regards to direct service connection, a May 2021 VA examiner opined that the condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event or illness.  The examiner noted that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of hypoxemic respiratory failure incurred in or caused by respiratory treatment in service.  The examiner explained that hypoxemic respiratory failure is included by hypertensive emergency.  The examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, supra; Stefl v. Nicholson, supra.  This opinion is therefore afforded probative weight.  There is no contrary opinion of record.  

The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report his own symptoms or matters within his personal knowledge.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, supra; Buchanan v. Nicholson, supra.  In addition, laypersons may, in some circumstances, opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, supra.  However, the matter of a medical diagnosis for a disability not capable of lay observation, such as that of hypoxemic respiratory failure, is a matter within the province of trained medical professionals.  See Jones v. Brown, supra.  In the instant case, there is no suggestion that the Veteran has developed an expertise in the diagnosing of hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Therefore, as the Veteran does not have the appropriate medical training and expertise to competently diagnose hypoxemic respiratory failure, the lay assertions in this regard have no probative value.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, supra; see also Woehlaert v. Nicholson, supra.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for hypoxemic respiratory failure is not warranted.  The appeal is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

1.   Entitlement to service connection for essential tremor bilateral upper extremities, to include as secondary to service connected PTSD with alcohol use disorder, is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his essential tremor in the upper extremities is related to service, particularly his exposure to contaminated water at Camp LeJeune. See April 2021 VA Form 20-0995.  Alternatively, the Veteran maintains that his essential tremor condition developed as a result of his alcohol use disorder associated with his PTSD. See January 2021 VA treatment record. A July 2022 rating decision made favorable findings that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a current disability, namely an essential tremor in both upper extremities, that the Veteran served in the Marines for the period from February 1972 to February 1974 and that the Veteran performed service at Camp LeJeune for at least 30 days during the affected period of contamination; the Board is bound by these favorable findings.  

A VA examination is required when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  See also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  The third prong, which requires that the evidence of record "indicate" that the claimed disability or symptoms "may be" associated with the established event, is a low threshold.  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.  

The records reflect that the Veteran was admitted to a VA hospital in January 2021 for alcohol detoxification; it was noted that his alcohol use apparently triggered by increase in depressive symptoms and anxiety.  During his hospital stay, the record noted chronic tremors in both upper extremities.  

In light of the Veteran's presumed in-service exposure to contaminated water at Camp LeJeune and his current diagnosis of essential tremor of the upper extremities, the Board finds he should have been accorded a competent medical examination to clarify the nature and etiology of his diagnosed essential tremor of the upper extremities.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, supra.  The failure to obtain an etiology opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule an examination to obtain an etiology opinion from an appropriate examiner to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed neurological condition, namely essential tremor of the upper extremities, to include as due to alcohol use disorder.  The entire claims file, to include a copy of this Remand, must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner in conjunction with the examination.  All indicated tests and studies should be conducted, and all clinical findings reported in detail.  The need for physical examination or telehealth evaluation is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the medical opinion.

Based on the review of the record, the examiner must provide an opinion as to the following:

(A) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any currently diagnosed tremor of the upper extremities had its onset during his active service or is otherwise etiologically related to such service? Specifically, the examiner should opine as to whether exposure to contaminated water caused or aggravated beyond its natural progression any currently existing essential tremor of the upper extremities.  The examiner should provide a reasoned opinion as to the effects of conceded toxic exposure (i.e., Camp LeJeune contaminated water).

(B) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any of the Veteran's currently diagnosed essential tremor of the upper extremities is either caused or aggravated (worsened beyond its natural progression) by his service connected PTSD with alcohol use disorder?

A rationale should be provided for all opinions offered.

The medical opinion must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate to consider and weigh against other evidence of record; medical opinions must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, ensure that the clinician so indicates and discusses why an opinion is not possible, to include whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.
