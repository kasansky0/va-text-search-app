DOCKET NO. 240920-477400
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder, is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's currently diagnosed acquired other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder is related to her active military service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from June 1988 to June 1992.  

This appeal is being adjudicated according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  See 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 169 (Jan. 18, 2019); 38 C.F.R. § 19.2.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision issued by a Regional Office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the November 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Evidentiary Standards 

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal.  VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

The law requires the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-29 (2000).  The Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence within the period on appeal and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim. 

Any findings favorable to the Veteran made by the VA Regional Office in notification of a decision are binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the finding.  38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  "Findings" means "conclusions on questions of fact and application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue under review."  Id.  

Service connection 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  This is referred to as "service connection."  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Generally, in order to show a service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).  

1. Service connection for other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder is granted. 

Scope of the Claim

The Veteran filed a claim for a mental health condition to include posttraumatic stress disorder.  In Clemons v. Shinseki, the United States court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that, when determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the claimant's description of the claim, symptoms described, and the information submitted or developed in support of the claim.  23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).  Thus, a claim for service connection may be expanded beyond a claimant's lay description of a disability. Id.  Based on the evidence of record, the Board has broadly construed the Veteran's claim as one for an acquired psychiatric disability.  

Analysis

In its October 2023 rating decision, the Regional Office included in its favorable findings that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed disability of other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder.  Absent clear and unmistakable error, the Board is bound by findings favorable to the Veteran made by the Regional Office.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the first element of service connection is satisfied. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2021.  The VA examiner documented review of the Veteran's VA e-folder in combination with an in-person examination.  The VA examiner documented the Veteran's report that while deployed to Turkey, she was and surrounded and attacked by a group of local townspeople after having been accidentally left behind by the caravan she was traveling with.  The Veteran's claims file contains a VA Memorandum dated January 2023 documenting service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations from August 1990, through July 1991.  Her DD 214 likewise documents such service.   

The evidence of record contains a lay statement from the Veteran's spouse, who was deployed with her at the time, indicating that after this incident he found the Veteran curled into a ball, shaking and crying uncontrollably, and that for the rest of their deployment she would not leave her tent without his presence.  The Board finds the lay statements from the Veteran and her spouse regarding her service and symptoms credible and probative.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  

The March 2021 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's other specified trauma and stressor-related disorder was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by the Veteran's service in Southwest Asia.  The Board finds this opinion is credible and probative based on the accompanying examination report.
