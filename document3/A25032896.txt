ORDER

An initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

A rating in excess of 40 percent for left eye with permanently nonfunctional hand motion only vision from traumatic eye injury resulting in tractional retinal detachment and traumatic macular hole that failed surgery with dry eye syndrome of bilateral lacrimal glands, presence of intraocular lens (left eye disability) is denied.

Service connection for sinusitis is granted.

Service connection for penile condition is denied.

Service connection for allergies is denied.

Service connection for Athlete's foot, to include tinea pedis and tinea unguium, is remanded.

Service connection for a low back disability, to include degenerative arthritis and pseudoarthritis after fusion or arthrodesis, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability was manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level II in each ear.

2. The Veteran's visual acuity warrants a 30 percent rating and his visual field defect warrants a 20 percent rating to a combined 40 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. §4.25.

3. The Veteran has a diagnosis of sinusitis and qualifying service in the Southwest Asia (SWA), to include exposure to fine particulate matter.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had any allergy disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a penile condition, to include erectile dysfunction, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's claimed Athlete's foot, diagnosed as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, began in service or is otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

7. The Veteran's low back disability was not shown as chronic in service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; and the disability is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2004 to March 2007. He has a 90 percent combined VA disability rating from July 9, 2022, along with special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k) on account of loss of one eye having only light perception from March 30, 2007.

The Veteran is a Persian Gulf War veteran as he served in Southwest Asia (SWA), specifically: Iraq from November 2005 to February 2006 and Kuwait in November 2005. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1117, 1119; 3.317(e). See also, VA Memo (December 2022) (verified toxic exposure under 38 U.S.C. § 1119); VA Memo (January 2023) (verified Persian Gulf Veteran status under 38 U.S.C. § 1117).

The April 7, 2023, rating decision on appeal addressed the claims for service connection for sinus condition; the May 17, 2023, rating decision on appeal addressed penile condition; the January 22, 2024, rating decision on appeal addressed allergies, bilateral hearing loss and left eye disability claims; and the March 15, 2024, rating decision on appeal addressed low back disorder and skin condition of the foot. These rating decisions constitute initial decisions in those matters; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, with regard to the Veteran's claim for sinus condition, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal as to each matter. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision pertaining to that issue on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims for allergies, bilateral hearing loss, penile condition and left eye disability, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Evaluations

Generally, disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings that is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4. Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations. See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings). When adjudicating a claim for an increased initial evaluation, the relevant time period is from the date of the claim. Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 215 (2007), rev'd in irrelevant part, Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (2009).

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss disability.

A January 2024 rating decision granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss, and assigned a noncompensable (zero) percent rating, effective from July 7, 2023. See Rating Decision (January 2024). This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision. See VA Form 10182 (March 2024) (arguing generally that a higher rating is warranted); C&P Exam at 6 (August 2023) (complaints of difficulty making out the words that he hears).

The Board concludes that the criteria for an initial compensable rating for service connected hearing loss disability are not met.  

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz). 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, Diagnostic Code 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII.

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a). In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral. Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

The Board finds that Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability was manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level II in both ears, which does not support the assignment of a compensable rating. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Table VII, Diagnostic Code 6100.

Here, an August 2023 VA-obtained Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) reflects complaints of difficulty making out the words that he hears. See C&P Exam at 6 (August 2023); 38 C.F.R. § 4.10; Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007). 

At that time, the Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

[August 2023]	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	25	25	30	35	29	88%

LEFT	25	25	35	40	31	86%

Applying these results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level II, bilaterally. Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level II for each ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a noncompensable (zero percent) disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100. An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown for either ear.

Based on the evidence above, a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is not warranted.

The Board expressly acknowledges its consideration of the lay evidence of record when adjudicating this claim. The Veteran reports difficulty making out the words that he hears. The Veteran is competent to report difficulty with his hearing; however, disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing. See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992). The rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing. The functional impact that the Veteran describes, is contemplated by the rating criteria. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017). The Veteran's main complaint is reduced hearing acuity and clarity, which is what is contemplated in the rating assigned. See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Evaluation of Eye Disability

The Board's duty to maximize benefits includes consideration of whether other diagnostic codes would be appropriate to evaluate symptoms of the Veteran's disability. When a particular service-connected disability is not listed in the rating schedule, it may be rated by analogy to a closely related disease in which not only the functions affected, but also the anatomical location and symptomatology are closely analogous. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27. Here, the Board finds that Diagnostic Code 6080, which addresses impairment of visual fields is more appropriate than Diagnostic Code 6025, and provides for the maximum rating when applied to the facts of the Veteran's case as will be discussed below.

The Veteran's bilateral eye disability is currently rated under Diagnostic Code 6025-6065. Hyphenated Diagnostic Codes are used when a rating under one Diagnostic Code requires use of an additional Diagnostic Code to identify the basis for the rating assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Here, the use of Diagnostic Codes 6025-6065 reflects that the Veteran's left eye disability is described as disorders of the lacrimal apparatus under Diagnostic Code 6025, and that the rating assigned is based on impairment of central visual acuity under Diagnostic Code 6065.

Under Diagnostic Code 6025, a 10 percent rating is warranted if the disorder of the lacrimal apparatus is unilateral, and a maximum 20 percent rating is warranted if the disability is bilateral. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6025. The parts of the lacrimal apparatus identified in Diagnostic Code 6025 (epiphora and dacryocystitis) are not an exclusive list, and the lacrimal apparatus is defined as "the system concerned with the secretion and circulation of tears and the normal fluid of the conjunctival sac; it consists of the lacrimal gland and ducts, and associated structures." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 120 (31st Ed. 2007).

The General Rating Formal for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate on the basis of either visual impairment due to a particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation. Note (1) indicates that, for the purposes of evaluations under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes.

The evaluation of visual impairment is based on impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function. 38 C.F.R. § 4.75(a). To determine the evaluation for visual impairment when both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, visual acuity and visual field defects are evaluated separately, and then combined under the provisions of § 4.25.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.76a, Computation of average concentric contraction of visual fields, normal degrees are the following: temporally - 85; down temporally - 85, down 65, down nasally - 50, nasally - 60, up nasally - 55, up - 45, up temporally - 55, total 500. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.76a

Diagnostic Code 6065 provides ratings where vision in one eye (the poorer eye) is 5/200 or better. Where the vison in the other is 20/40, a 30 percent rating is warranted. Where the vison in the other is 20/50, a 40 percent rating is warranted. Where the vison in the other is 20/70, a 50 percent rating is warranted. Where the vison in the other is 20/100, a 60 percent rating is warranted. Where the vison in the other is 20/200, a 70 percent rating is warranted. Where the vison in the other is 15/200, a 80 percent rating is warranted. Where the vison in the other is 10/200, a 90 percent rating is warranted. Where the vison in the other is 5/200, a 100 percent rating is warranted.

Diagnostic Code 6080 provides ratings where there is a defect to the visual field. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79. Under Diagnostic Code 6080, a 10 percent rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 46 to 60 degrees bilaterally, contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 16 to 60 degrees unilaterally, or the loss of the superior half or nasal half of the visual field bilaterally. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6080. A 20 percent rating may be awarded for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 6 to 15 degrees unilaterally. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79. A 30 percent rating may be awarded for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining visual field of 31 to 45 degrees bilaterally, contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 5 degrees unilaterally, or loss of the temporal or inferior half of the visual field bilaterally. Id. A 50 percent rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 16 to 30 degrees bilaterally. Id. A 70 percent rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 6 to 15 degrees bilaterally. Id. Finally, a 100 percent rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 5 degrees. Id.

For evaluations of restrictions in visual field(s), the examiner must use either Goldmann kinetic perimetry or automated perimetry using Humphrey Model 750, Octopus Model 101, or later versions of these perimetric devices with simulated kinetic Goldmann testing capability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.77.

Determination of the average concentric contraction of the visual field of each eye by measuring the remaining visual field (in degrees) at each of the eight principal meridians 45 degrees apart, adding them, and dividing the sum by eight. 38 C.F.R. § 4.77(b). To determine the evaluation for visual impairment when both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, separately evaluate the visual acuity and visual field defect (expressed as a level of visual acuity), and combine them under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.

Disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are generally rated separately before ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. VA, however, is prohibited from pyramiding (rating the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes). 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. When disabilities have duplicative or overlapping symptoms, the rule against pyramiding prohibits VA from compensating the Veteran more than once for the same symptom or impairment. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017).

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for left eye disability.

A March 2008 rating decision granted service connection for left eye disability and assigned an initial 30 percent rating effective March 30, 2007. A March 2015 rating decision denied the Veteran's April 2014 claim for increase. An April 2019 rating decision denied his February 2019 claim for increase, which was continued in a July 2019 rating decision. 

On July 9, 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA Form21-526EZ, claim for increase. An October 2022 rating decision denied the claim, and continued the 30 percent rating for left eye disability. A January 2023 Higher Level Review (HLR) rating decision denied the Veteran's October 2022 HLR request for a higher rating. 

On July 7, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form21-526EZ, claim for increase. A January 22, 2024, rating decision granted a higher 40 percent rating effective July 7, 2023-date of claim. It is noted that a January 2024 rating decision changed the Diagnostic Code for rating the Veteran's left eye disability from Diagnostic Code 6064, for impairment of central visual acuity, to Diagnostic Codes 6025-6065, for disorders of the lacrimal apparatus and for impairment of central visual acuity, respectively. The assignment of a particular Diagnostic Code is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case." Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993). One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology. Any change in diagnostic code by a VA adjudicator must be specifically explained. Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625, 629 (1992). It is permissible to switch diagnostic codes to reflect more accurately a claimant's current symptoms. See Read v. Shinseki, 651 F.3d 1296, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2011).

This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with the assigned rating. See VA Form 10182 (March 2024) (seeking a higher disability rating for his service-connected left eye disability, which is rated as 40 percent disabling under Diagnostic Codes 6025-6065, effective July 7, 2023. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.79). The relevant rating review period begins on July 7, 2023, with a one year look back-date of claim; and ends on January 22, 2024-date of the VA decision on appeal.

The Board concludes that the schedular criteria for a rating in excess of 40 percent are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.75-4.78, 4.79, Diagnostic Codes 6065-6080.

The Board finds that the Veteran's visual acuity warrants a 30 percent rating and his visual field defect warrants a 20 percent rating, and are combined as 40 percent under 38 C.F.R. §4.25.

Turning to the evidence of record, in September 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA examination that reflects retinal disorder, left eye macular hole, left eye presence of intraocular lens and left eye with permanently nonfunctional hand motion only vision from traumatic eye injury resulting in tractional retinal detachment and traumatic macular hole that failed surgery, all of which were noted to have stayed the same. His uncorrected and uncorrected distance and near vision was 5/200 or worse in the left eye and 20/20 in the right eye. The Veteran was limited to no more than light perception only in his left eye; and was unable to recognize test letters at one foot or closer with his left eye. In terms of external exam, the Veteran had pseudophakia, presence of intraocular lens in his left eye. In terms of internal exam, he had left eye macular hole; status post retinal detachment (other specified retinal disorders), laser scars and scleral buckle. The Veteran had visual field defect and loss of visual field - specifically, loss of nasal half of visual field on the left; he also had scotoma affecting at least 14 of visual field on the left. He had no lacrimal system conditions. The Veteran's decrease in visual acuity or other visual impairment was noted as attributable to a retina macula, or vitreous condition- specifically, loss of neuro retinal tissue due to traumatic retinal detachment and macular hole. He had no incapacitating episodes; functional impact was described as the Veteran having vision in only one eye, which led to no binocular vision making driving, judging distances as well as depth perception very difficult and impacting all aspects of life. 

In September 2022, the Veteran underwent another VA examination for his eyes, which reflects diagnoses of total retinal detachment, left eye; dry eye syndrome of bilateral lacrimal glands; and presence of intraocular lens, all of which were noted as having progressed. The progression was described as total retinal detachment left eye - loss of vision and depth perception; dry eye syndrome- gritty sensation, photophobia, headaches; presence of intraocular lens - visually significant cataracts required removal of cataracts. Treatment included retinal detachment surgery, artificial tears and cataract surgery. His uncorrected and uncorrected distance and near vision was 5/200 or worse in the left eye and 20/20 in the right eye. The Veteran was limited to no more than light perception only in his left eye; and was unable to perceive objects, hand movements, or count fingers at three feet. External exam showed pseudophakia. Internal exam showed left eye blindness status post retinal detachment. The Veteran had visual field defect and loss of visual field - specifically, loss of nasal half of visual field and loss of superior half of visual field on the left. The examination also bilateral dry eye syndrome, for which he used over-the-counter artificial tear drops, left postoperative cataract, and left detached retina causing loss of neuro (sensory retina). No incapacitating episodes or functional impact was identified.

The more persuasive evidence of record weighs against the assignment of a rating in excess of 40 percent.

The Board finds that a combined rating under Diagnostic Code 6065-6080 for the Veteran's service-connected left eye disability is appropriate. Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993) (applying the more deferential "arbitrary, capricious" standard, rather than de novo review, to the Board's determination of the appropriate Diagnostic Code). Therefore, the evaluation of the Veteran's left eye disability is considered under Diagnostic Codes 6065 and 6080. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79; Lendermann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

Here, Diagnostic Code 6065 is appropriate because the evidence indicates that the Veteran's right eye visual acuity is 20/20, while in the left eye it is 5/200. Applying these facts to Diagnostic Code 6065 shows that 30 percent would be assigned. 

Next, Diagnostic Code 6080 provides for visual field defects to be compensated, including with remaining field of 6 to 15 degrees at 20 percent if unliteral, and at 70 percent if bilateral. Here, the VA examination dated in September 2023 shows an average contraction to 35.625 degrees: field of vision temporally was 75 degrees; vision down temporally was 70 in the left eye; field of vision down was 50 degrees; field of vision down nasally was 25; vision nasally was 5; vision up nasally was 0; field of vision up was 5; field of vision up temporally was 55 (normal); total remaining visual field for the left eye was 285. Therefore, unilateral concentric contraction of the left eye visual field with remaining field of 31 to 45 degrees warrants 10 percent evaluation, and is included in the overall visual fields evaluation. See 38 C.F.R. 4.79.

The right eye shows an average contraction to 57.875 degrees based on the field of vision temporally to 75 degrees; vision down temporally at 70; field of vision down at 65 degrees (normal); field of vision down nasally at 50 degrees (normal); field of vision nasally at 60 (normal); field of vision up nasally at 48; field of vision up  at 40 degrees; field of vision up temporally at 55 degrees (normal) .The total remaining visual field for the right eye was 463. 

Unilateral concentric contraction of the right eye visual field with remaining field of 46 to 60 degrees warrants 10 percent evaluation, and has been included in the Veteran's overall visual fields evaluation. See 38 C.F.R. 4.77. When both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, the visual acuity and visual field defect (expressed as a level of visual acuity), are separately evaluated and combined under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §4.25 (38 C.F.R. §4.77(c)). 

Thus, the Veteran's visual acuity warrants a 30 percent rating and his visual field defect warrants a 20 percent rating. These ratings combine under 38 C.F.R. §4.25 for 40 percent evaluation. 

With regard to Diagnostic Code 6025, the Veteran's bilateral dry eye syndrome is associated with his lacrimal gland, not the lacrimal apparatus. Specifically, the VA examiner found that the Veteran did not have a disorder of the lacrimal apparatus, to include epiphora, dacryocystitis, etc. While the Veteran's symptoms may necessitate use of eye lubricants and artificial tears is not akin to watering of the eyes. Indeed, it is the inverse of a lacrimal apparatus disorder. Therefore, Diagnostic Code 6025 does not apply and a compensable rating under this diagnostic code is not warranted. While ongoing dry eye symptoms are noted, no functional or visual impairment is associated with this. Moreover, the September 2022 VA examination did not show loss of superior half of visual field on the left, while the September 2023 VA examination showed loss of superior half of visual field on the left and loss of nasal half of visual field.  As such, the evidence does not show that a rating of 40 percent was warranted prior to the Veteran filing his increased rating claim in July 2023. 

Consideration has been given to assigning a higher rating under another diagnostic code. However, there are no additional complications associated with the Veteran's left eye disability other than that for which service-connection is already in effect, to specifically include the Veteran's impairment of central visual acuity and impairment of visual fields. 38 C.F.R. § §§ 4.76, 4.79, Diagnostic Codes 6065, 6080. The Veteran had no incapacitating episodes, no scotoma (Diagnostic Code 6081), and no impairment of muscle function (Diagnostic Codes 6090, 6091). Therefore, a higher rating under another diagnostic code is not warranted and the Veteran's symptoms are accurately reflected by the ratings assigned. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.76, 4.79.

Consideration has been given to assigning staged ratings. However, at no time during the relevant rating review period has the disability been shown to be manifested by symptoms that warranted a higher schedular ratings than assigned. Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. 119; Hart, 21 Vet. App. 505 

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.; see also Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

Certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic (reliably diagnosed) in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

Additionally, in August 2022, the President signed into law the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022) (commonly known as the "Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022" or "PACT Act"). Among other things, the "PACT Act" established the presumption of in-service exposure to substances, chemicals, and airborne hazards, including from burn pits, for certain covered veterans, on or after August 2, 1990. 38 U.S.C. § 1119; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(4).

Service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

3. Entitlement to service connection for sinus condition.

The Veteran asserts he is entitled to service connection for a sinus condition which began after he returned from deployment, where he was exposed to burn pits in Iraq and Kuwait, and inhaled fumes from burning vehicles.  See VA 21-526EZ (February 2023). 

The Board notes that the April 2023 rating decision identified as favorable finding that the Veteran was diagnosed with seasonal sinus issues. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Moreover, a March 2023 VA TERA Memorandum identified the Veteran's exposures to include exposure to particulate matter, as well as bacteriological and chemical contamination. See other (March 2023).

The Board concludes that the Veteran has qualifying service to award entitlement to service connection for sinusitis on the basis of presumptive service connection for exposure to fine particulate matter. 

First, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current disability of sinusitis. Specifically, the Veteran has been diagnosed with sinusitis, including in April 2014 and June 2017 during his VA treatment.  See e.g. CAPRI at 42, 132 (February 2023). Thus, the first element of service connection is met.

Second, the Veteran has documented active duty service in SWA theater of operations after September 19, 2001, including service in Iraq and Kuwait. See e.g., VA Memo (January 2023) (service in Iraq from November 2005 to February 2006 and Kuwait in November 2005). Qualifying service includes active service in SWA theater of operations, including Iran and Kuwait, on or after September 19, 2001, for which exposure to fine particulate matter is presumed absent affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 (a)(4)-(6). Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran has qualifying service and exposure to fine particulate matter is presumed.

Third, sinusitis is among the diseases subject to this provision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(2)(iii). For Veterans with qualifying service, service connection may be presumed for certain listed chronic diseases associated with exposure to fine particulate matter. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.320. Service connection may be presumed if the listed disease manifests to any degree at any time following separation from a qualifying period of military service even if there is no evidence of such disease during the period of military service. 38 C.F.R § 3.320(a)(1)-(2). 

Accordingly, the claim is granted.

4. Entitlement to service connection for penile condition.

The Veteran seeks service connection for penile condition as secondary to his service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). See VA 21-526EZ (February 2023) (reports stress of always thinking about what happened to him along with being depressed and just being sad for no reason).

The Board concludes that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding the Veteran has, or has had any penile condition, at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Initially, the Board observes that the Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination and medical opinion, in part, to determine whether his claimed penile condition was related to service or service-connected disability. See C&P Exam (March 2023). He did not attend the examination and has not provided good cause for missing the examination. Therefore, the claim on appeal will be decided based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b); Kyhn v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 228, 238 (2011); see also Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991) (the "duty to assist" is not a one-way street).

The Veteran does not contend that his claimed condition had its onset in service and the available service treatment records (STRs) show no complaints or findings for any penile condition. As above, he contends that his penile condition is due to his service-connected PTSD. An April 1970 separation physical reflects normal findings for genitourinary system. See STR-Medical at 15 (January 2005). 

Post service, the first mention of any penile condition dates to the Veteran's initial February 2023 VA claim, roughly 16 years after separation from service. VA treatment records, however, reflect no documented complaints or findings for the claimed condition, including erectile dysfunction (ED); and denied any penile discharge in June 2016 and January 2018. See CAPRI at 38, 40, 50 (February 2023).

Here, neither the lay nor the medical evidence shows any disability or diagnosed disorder of the penis, including ED. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110. The Veteran has neither provided nor identified any relevant evidence that he has the claimed disability. Although the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms, he has not provided any description of his penile condition symptoms that reach the level of functional impairment in earning capacity. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-69     (Fed. Cir. 2018) ("pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."). Also, he did not present for his scheduled examination where relevant history and symptoms of disability may have been provided by him to a medical professional. VA's duty to assist is a two-way street.  If the Veteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential to establishing his claim.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).

In the absence of proof of a present disability due to disease or injury, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

5. Entitlement to service connection for allergies.

The Veteran seeks service connection for allergies, stating that he operated around burn pits, including in Fallujah, as well as dust that resulted in him developing allergies that he had not had before. See VA 21-526EZ (August 2023). At his VA examination in December 2023, he reported fever in 2008, dry coughing and nose itching. See C&P Exam at 7 (December 2023). 

The Board concludes that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding the Veteran has or has had an allergies disorder of the respiratory system at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

The available service treatment records (STRs) show no complaints or findings for allergies or allergy symptoms. As above, he provided the onset date of his claimed allergies after deployment to SWA. A January 2007 Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) physical shortly prior to separation reflects normal findings for nose, sinuses, mouth and throat. See STR-Medical at 6 (July 2007). 

Post service, the first mention of any allergies dates to the Veteran's initial claim in August 2023, 16 years after separation from service. However, there are also no documented complaints or findings for the claimed condition in the Veteran's post service treatment records. Notably, the Veteran denied having any allergies, including in June 2016, October 2018 and May 2019. See CAPRI at 100, 104, 121 (January 2024). The Veteran underwent a Sinusitis, Rhinitis and Other Conditions of the Nose, Throat, Larynx and Pharynx Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) in January 2024, where he reported dry coughing and itchy nose, and that he took Zyrtec as needed. See C&P Exam at 7 (January 2024). The DBQ revealed no diagnosis based on a thorough review of the systems, including normal mucosa, and no redness or swelling of turbinates. 

The Board finds that competent, credible evidence has not been submitted showing that the Veteran has or has had recent to the filing of his claim, an allergies disability of the upper respiratory system. While the Veteran believes that service connection is warranted for allergies, the medical evidence of record does not contain a current diagnosis of an allergy disorder of the upper respiratory system; and, while the Veteran reports use of over-the-counter seasonal allergy medical as needed, as well as symptoms of dry coughing and itchy nose, he has not described any symptoms of disability causing functional loss or impairment in earning capacity. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-69 (Fed. Cir. 2018). 

In the absence of proof of a present disability due to disease or injury, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

6. Entitlement to service connection for tinea pedis and tinea unguium, claimed as Athlete's foot.

The Veteran contends that he has Athlete's foot that began during service. See VA 21-526EZ (August 2023) (reporting that his Athlete's foot began after a field operation where his boots would not get dry, after which his feet began to itch and developed fungus that later spread to his toenails and caused cracks on his skin around his toes).

The Board concludes that the criteria for service connection for Athlete's foot condition, diagnosed as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, are not met. 

First, the Board finds that the more persuasive evidence weighs against finding that the Veteran's claimed Athlete's foot, diagnosed as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, had it onset in service. STRs reflect no complaints or abnormal pathology of the skin of the feet or toenails. Moreover, the Veteran's February 2006 PDHA shows that he denied having either during his recent deployment or at the time of the assessment any skin disease or rashes, including on his feet; and the diagnosed as tinea pedis and tinea unguium are first documented more than 16 years after service. See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) (August 2023).  

Second, the Board finds that the more persuasive evidence weighs against finding that the Veteran's claimed Athlete's foot, diagnosed as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, was noted in service with continuity of symptoms since service. 

The Veteran is competent to report his symptoms to include that he had symptoms of Athlete's foot in service, described as dry, itchy feet with fungus that spread to his toenails and caused cracks on his skin around his toes. However, to the extent that he suggests in-service onset of symptoms with continuity of symptoms since service, the Board finds that this is less that credible as it is incongruent with other evidence of record. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed Cir. 1996) (holding that, in weighing credibility of lay evidence VA may consider such elements as interest, bias, inconsistent statements, bad character, internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, self-interest, consistency with other evidence of record, desire for monetary gain, and demeanor of the witness). 

This is because the STRs reflect no complaints or abnormal pathology of the skin of the feet or toenails, but does show complaints of skin problems assessed as tinea versicolor on his back, neck and chest in August 2005. It seems incongruent that there would be other documented skin complaints and findings, but none pertaining to the feet and toenails. Further, the Veteran's February 2006 PDHA shows that he denied having either during his recent deployment or at the time of the assessment any skin disease or rashes, including on his feet; and the Veteran's VA treatment records reflect no complaints or history of chronic, persistent, or recurrent symptoms of Athlete's foot when otherwise obtaining skin care and reporting symptoms, diagnosed as tinea corporis (ring worm) in 2008. The foregoing, coupled with the more than 16 years between service separation and the first post service indication of any foot/toenail fungal condition, tends to weigh against a finding of any recurrent, or persistent problem in service; or continuity of any symptoms post service. This finding is further bolstered by the Veteran's original VA disability claim, dated December 2007, wherein he did not include a claim for any skin disorder of the feet or toenails-thus, suggesting he did not have any persistent, recurrent, or chronic fungal infection of his feet and/or toenails at that time. 

Third, the Board finds that the competent evidence of record establishes that the Veteran's diagnosed conditions of the feet (tinea pedis) and toenails (tinea unguium) are less likely than not due to his in-service exposures as there is a clear etiology other than the in-service exposures. Specifically, December 2023 and March 2024 VA-obtained medical opinions reflect that the Veteran was diagnosed was tinea pedis and tinea unguium, and that these condition are due to fungal infection, not his Gulf War exposure (TERAs). A clear etiology other than the in-service exposures from the Veteran's TERAs was identified. The opinions are supported with sufficient explanation to inform the Board that these fungal infections are entirely independent from the chemical and particulate exposures the Veteran had in service (TERAs). The Board finds the opinions persuasive and there is no other competent evidence to weigh against them. 

On balance, the weight of the most persuasive evidence is against the claim.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

7. Entitlement to service connection for low back disability.

The Veteran contends that his low back pain is due to the combat load he had to carry on a daily basis as well as the packs he had to haul during hikes.  See VA 21-526EZ (July 2023).

The AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of pseudoarthritis after fusion or arthrodesis.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's low back was not shown as chronic in service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; and the disability is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

STRs reflect no complaints, findings, or abnormal pathology of spine, to include signs or symptoms of a back disability. Indeed, the Veteran denied any back problems at his Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) separation examination, stating that he was in good health. See STR - Medical at 2 (July 2007). The Veteran has not reasonably identified any relevant outstanding treatment records since his service separation in 2007. VA received his back claim in 2023. A December 2023 VAMO reflects a diagnosis of degenerative arthritis. See CAPRI at 26 (January 2024). The VAMO reflects that the Veteran's low back disability was less likely than not caused by his military service in view of the STRs, showing no complaints, and the Veteran's self-reports that he injured his back on the job in October 2014, and that x-ray findings were consistent with age related degenerative arthritis even considering the Veteran's statements.

Here, competent, credible evidence has not been presented showing that the Veteran had chronic, persistent, or recurrent back symptoms in service, or soon after service. 

The Veteran is competent to report performing in-service duties that involved heavy lifting and/or carrying of military gear. To the extent that he suggests in-service onset of symptoms and continuity since service, or the incurrence of an in-service injury to the back, the Board finds that this is less than credible as it is incongruent with other evidence of record. Caluza, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed Cir. 1996). 

The Veteran's STRs reflect no complaints pertaining to the back although they do reflect that the Veteran presented for other problems: such as eye problems, skin on his back and shoulder problems. Further, the 2007 MEB examination at service separation reflects normal clinical evaluation of spine; and the 2007 MEB Report of Medical History at separation reflects that the Veteran did not report a history of having, or having had recurrent back pain. The Veteran also denied any injury other than noted-none were noted vis-à-vis the back. Additionally, the Veteran's original July 2007 VA disability claim did not include any claim for a back disorder and a January 2008 VA general examination, soon after service separation, reflects he noted problems with his eye only. There are no documented complaints or findings before July 2023 for back disability and, although he reported differently on his July 2023 VA back claim, the Veteran reported on December 2023 examination that he injured his back in October 2014 working in the oil field. Therefore, the Board finds that the report of in-service injury with onset of symptoms and continuity since service is less than credible, and the Veteran's statements have no probative value.

Further, the competent evidence of record links the Veteran's claimed disability to his post service work in the oil field, with injury, and the x-ray findings for arthritis to his age. This opinion is persuasive as the essential rationale is clearly discernible-a  roadmap connecting the supporting facts to the conclusion is not required. Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012). The Board assigns greater probative value to the opinion when coupled with the Veteran's report of injury in the oil field, than to his statements made in the context of procuring VA disability benefits. 

On balance, the weight of the most persuasive evidence is against the claim.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
