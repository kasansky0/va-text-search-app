REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for colon cancer polyps is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1973 to November 1993.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

Initially, the Veteran requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the March 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review. The Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for colon cancer polyps, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The denial of due process may include issuing a Board decision prior to the expiration of the one-year period for a claimant to request a docket change. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, the Board is not rendering a decision on the merits but remanding the case. Accordingly, the Veteran's due process rights are not adversely affected by not waiting until July 22, 2025, the end of the period in which to request a docket change.

Service Connection? 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during the service - the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).? 

In addition, service connection for certain chronic diseases may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?258, 271-72 (2015). Although the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).? 

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F. 3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).? 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).?

Entitlement to service connection for colon cancer polyps.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for colon cancer polyps. 

The Board is bound by previous favorable findings, and the July 2024 rating decision found that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) and that he has been diagnosed with colon polyps.

The Veteran's service treatment records are generally silent for gastrointestinal issues, except in February 1975, the Veteran complained of mid epigastric cramps that occurred one to two times weekly and lasted ten to fifteen minutes in duration. The Veteran reported that he would be doubled over during these attacks and unable to straighten up. He further noted that they usually happen shortly after meals but that he had normal bowel movements. The Board also notes an April 1993 Report of Medical History in which the Veteran checked "Don't Know" when asked if he has ever had or currently has tumor, growth, cyst, or cancer.

Subsequent VA treatment records show that the Veteran complained of gastrointestinal bleeding at the age of 48 in March 2002. Records from the Veteran's gastroenterologist include a March 2002 endoscopy that revealed a 30 mm polyp which was snared and retrieved. The following month, the Veteran underwent an elective sigmoid colon resection at the referral of his gastroenterologist. An April 2002 pathology report notes a malignant colon polyp.

VA records also show that between 2000 and 2002, the Veteran reported that he eats a regular diet and exercises regularly; his weight ranged from 217 pounds to 232 pounds. A VA treatment note from July 2005 notes that the Veteran managed an auto parts store and did some lifting and standing all day. 

The Veteran had negative colonoscopies in 2003, 2004, and 2008. In 2013, he had two colonoscopies and three adenomas were removed. In 2018, he had another colonoscopy which revealed a hyperplastic polyp in mid transverse. In July 2021, the Veteran sought treatment for blood in his stool and intermittent abdominal pain. An October 2021 colonoscopy revealed numerous polyps which were removed.

In May 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination. After reviewing the file, the examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed colon cancer polyps was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner reasoned that medical literature supports that the most likely etiology of the Veteran's diagnosed malignant colon polyps status post colectomy is being African American, being over the age of 50, being overweight, and consuming a diet high in fat, not the TERA.

The Board finds this opinion inadequate because the examiner relied on an inaccurate factual premise. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (an opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value). The examiner opined that the Veteran being over the age of 50 is one factor that led to his diagnosed malignant colon polyps. However, the record reveals gastrointestinal abnormalities and surgical procedures prior to the Veteran attaining age 50. As noted above, the Veteran complained of mid epigastric cramps and blood in the stool before turning age 50. He also had a 30 mm polyp removed and colon resection prior to turning 50 years old. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Veteran was consuming a diet high in fat at the onset of his gastrointestinal issues. 

The AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion supported by a complete, sound, and well-reasoned rationale constitutes a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error requiring remand under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum VA medical opinion from a qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's diagnosed colon polyps. The claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be made available and reviewed by the examiner. An in-person examination is not required unless deemed necessary by the clinician. 

After a review of the claims file, the examiner should address the following: 

(a)	Whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e. likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's colon polyps was incurred in service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include the indicated toxic exposure risk activity, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

(b)	The examiner must provide a complete rationale for his or her opinion in the examination report. If the above requested opinion cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner must state this and provide a rationale for such conclusion.
