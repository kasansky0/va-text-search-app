REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's disease claimed as the result of herbicide agent exposure is remanded.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from October 1962 to October 1965.  

In October 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for Parkinson's disease claimed as the result of herbicide agent exposure.  In January 2025, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decisions on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.  However, as the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(ii).  

Entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's disease claimed as the result of herbicide agent exposure is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that service connection for Parkinson's disease is warranted as the diagnosed disability was incurred as the result of his exposure to herbicide agent contaminated aircraft while an officer aboard the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga.  

In his January 2025 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, the Veteran conveyed that he "understands that the ship logs did not place USS Ticonderoga within the 12 nautical mile Blue Water area; however, we can see that his ship did get fairly close to the Blue Water area" and "the ship was an aircraft carrier, and he recalls that the aircrafts contained Agent Orange residue, which is likely how he was exposed."  

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should obtain all relevant service which could potentially be helpful in resolving the Veteran's claim.  Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78 (1990); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).

The service personnel records state that the Veteran served aboard the USS Ticonderoga from November 1962 to December 1963 and the USS Brough from January 1964 June 1965.  

An October 2022 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Herbicide Exposure Verification Memo states that "exposure to herbicides cannot be conceded as the evidence of record does not show the Veteran had duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam, or on its inland waterways, or nautical service in the offshore eligible waters as defined in the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, Public Law 116-23."  

A July 2024 VA Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum states that the Veteran qualified for a presumption of exposure to "herbicide agent -2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin  (TCDD)" and "VBMS Flash - Blue Water Navy."  

An October 2024 VA Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum states that the Veteran did not qualify for a presumption of exposure to" hazards as "the Veteran did not participate in a TERA."  

Considering the conflicting VA TERA findings, the Board is unable to discern whether VA has conceded the Veteran's in-service herbicide agent exposure.  Further action is needed to make such a determination.  That is a pre decisional error.   

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Contact the appropriate records facility or service entity to verify the Veteran's claimed exposure to herbicide agents while the Veteran was aboard the USS Ticonderoga and the USS Brough, to include exposure to any aircraft contaminated with herbicide agents while performing his naval duties aboard the USS Ticonderoga.
