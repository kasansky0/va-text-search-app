ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

Tinnitus has been shown to have originated during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from November 1988 to April 1989.  She had additional duty with the Army Reserve.  

In December 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for tinnitus.  In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service Connection for Tinnitus 

The Veteran asserts that service connection for tinnitus is warranted as the claimed disability was initially manifested during active service.

Service connection may be granted for recurrent disability arising from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The service treatment records do not refer to tinnitus or ringing of the ears. 

In her February 2021 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran reported that tinnitus was initially manifested as the result of noise exposure including grenade explosions during her period of basic training in 1988.  

The report of a May 2021 VA examination the Veteran reported that tinnitus began during active service as the result of her noise exposure during active service.  She was diagnosed with tinnitus.  

A September 2023 written statement from R. Vara-Good, APRN, conveys that the "Veteran's current auditory condition to include bilateral tinnitus is at least as likely as not (a 50%/50% probability) due to and/or related to military acoustic trauma during active duty military service."  

The evidence is in at least equipoise as to whether the diagnosed tinnitus originated during active service.  The Veteran reported that tinnitus was initially manifested as the result of her noise exposure, which include grenade explosions, during her period of basic training.  A VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with tinnitus.  Ms. Vara-Good concluded that the diagnosed tinnitus was related to the Veteran's reported in service noise exposure.  Upon resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
