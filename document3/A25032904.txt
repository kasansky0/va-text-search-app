ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The most probative evidence supports a finding that obstructive sleep apnea was caused by obesity resulting from the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 1154(a), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310; VAOPGCPREC 1-2017.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1979 - March 1981.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Regional Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran wants VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify that evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea

The AOJ favorably found in the September 2023 rating decision on appeal that the Veteran has a diagnosis of sleep apnea, and that the Veteran's claimed primary disabilities of left and right knee strain are service connected. As there is no clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by those favorable findings.

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is shown to be proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show that a current disability exists and that the current disability was either caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

VA's Office of General Counsel has held that a claim for secondary service connection may rest on obesity as an intermediary between the claimed secondary disability and the service-connected primary disability. VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. The theory of causation and/or aggravation may serve to establish secondary service connection for any a disability, with obesity serving as an intermediate step. Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020).

A sleep study conducted in June 2022, shows a diagnosis of moderate obstructive sleep apnea. The Veteran asserts that obstructive sleep apnea was caused by obesity, which resulted from the service-connected left and right knee disabilities. 

The Board notes that the Veteran had been seen for obesity by VA Medical providers since at least 2018. 

The Veteran underwent a private sleep apnea medical assessment in January 2023. At that assessment, the Veteran was noted to have a BMI of 36.3, meeting the clinical standard for obesity. At that medical assessment, the examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's sleep apnea was caused by the Veteran's weight gain and obesity due to the service-connected left knee strain and right knee strain. The examiner further provided an opinion that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's sleep apnea is secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by the weight gain and obesity from the service-connected conditions. Finally, the examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that without the Veteran's weight gain and obesity, sleep apnea would not have occurred in this Veteran. The examiner conducted a thorough review of the Veteran's medical records and provided a detailed rationale to support the opinion. The examiner cited 16 medical studies that supported the position that obesity was causative for OSA, and cited to the VA Office of General Counsel memorandum. VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. The Board affords this opinion significant probative weight. 

The Veteran received a VA medical examination regarding sleep apnea in February 2023. The examiner opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea was less likely that not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected condition. The examiner provided a limited rationale for this opinion, merely stating that sleep apnea cannot be caused by right or left knee strain. The opinion does not consider the possibility of weight gain and obesity from the service-connected disabilities as a potential intermediate step between the Veteran's service-connected disabilities and sleep apnea. Therefore, the Board affords this opinion minimal probative weight. 

In an August 2023 opinion, the same medical examiner opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. The examiner's stated rationale was that the physical causes of sleep apnea are throat muscles relaxing and blocking the airflow into the lungs. Therefore, the Veteran's left and right knee strain could not cause the physical symptoms of sleep apnea. This opinion also fails to consider whether the Veteran experienced weight gain and obesity due to service-connected disabilities, which then caused sleep apnea. The Board therefore affords this opinion little probative weight.   

The Board finds that the probative value of the positive evidence outweighs the probative value of the negative evidence. The February 2023 and August 2023 negative opinions of record did not consider the Veteran's contention that obesity was caused by the service-connected left knee strain and right knee strain, which in turn caused sleep apnea. The February 2023 and August 2023 opinions did not discuss the Veteran's obesity. Therefore, those opinions do not contain sufficient rationale that the Board's evaluation would be fully informed, including any discussion of the favorable evidence of record. D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 104 (2008); see also Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning). 

In contrast, the Board finds that the January 2023 private medical opinion regarding this matter is highly probative, as it is accompanied by a full rationale citing to evidence specific to the Veteran's case and accepted medical principles. Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185 (1999). Moreover, that opinion is factually accurate, having considered the evidence of record, and the clinician has demonstrated to be competent through education, training, and experience to offer the medical opinion. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).

Therefore, the Board finds that the most probative evidence indicates that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, to include left knee strain and right knee strain, resulted in obesity, which caused sleep apnea. In such cases, service connection is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; VAOPGCPREC 1-2017.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence supports a finding that sleep apnea was caused by obesity, that was caused by the service-connected disabilities, to include left knee strain and right knee strain. Therefore, service connection for sleep apnea is granted.
