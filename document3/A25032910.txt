DATE:  April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 24, 2023, for the grant of entitlement to a 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD) with anxiety, insomnia, and nightmare symptoms (psychiatric disability), is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a November 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, rated 30 percent from January 28, 2014, and rated 100 percent from May 24, 2023.

2. In a December 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Form 10182, the Veteran appealed the initial rating assigned for his psychiatric disability in the November 2023 rating decision, at which time he specifically sought entitlement to a 100 percent rating prior to May 24, 2023. 

3. While the December 2023 appeal was pending at the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), the Veteran was issued a January 2024 rating decision in which the 100 percent rating for his psychiatric disability was continued. 

4. In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, giving rise to the current appeal, the Veteran again appealed the initial rating assigned for his psychiatric disability, again arguing that he should be in receipt of a 100 percent rating for his psychiatric disability from the effective date of service connection, January 28, 2014. 

5. In a February 2025 decision, the Board denied entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's psychiatric disability for the period on appeal prior to May 24, 2023. 

6. In light of the Board's February 2025 decision, there remains no justiciable case or controversy for Board consideration in this appeal stream, and the appeal has therefore, been rendered moot. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There being no justiciable case or controversy, the issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for a psychiatric disability is moot and is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105 (2018).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from July 1968 to November 1971. This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision issued by the VA agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the January 2024 rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran contends that he should be granted an effective date earlier than May 24, 2023, for the grant of entitlement to a 100 percent rating for psychiatric disability. Specifically, the Veteran argued that he is entitled to the effective date of January 28, 2014, which is the date of his original service connection claim. 

By way of history, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability in a November 2023 rating decision, rated 30 percent beginning January 28, 2014, and rated 100 percent beginning May 24, 2023. Subsequently, the AOJ continued the 100 percent rating in a January 2024 rating decision. Those facts are not in dispute.

In a December 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed the initial rating assigned for his psychiatric disability in the November 2023 rating decision. Subsequently, as noted above, the Veteran was issued a January 2024 rating decision in which the 100 percent rating for the Veteran's psychiatric disability was continued.

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the AOJ erroneously issued the January 2024 rating decision pursuant to the May 2023 Board remand. In this regard, the Board in May 2023 did not render a final decision on the merits of the Veteran's service connection claim, but rather, a preliminary order. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100 (2024) ("[a] remand is in the nature of a preliminary order and does not constitute a final decision of the Board.") However, because the Veteran properly and timely appealed the January 2024 rating decision, the Board waives any jurisdictional defect as to the AOJ's continued grant of a 100 percent rating for the service-connected psychiatric disability. See Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45 (2009).

Further, the Board notes that the AOJ did not actually adjudicate whether the Veteran was entitled to a rating in excess of 30 percent prior to May 24, 2023, for his psychiatric disability. As such, the VA Form 10182 received in February 2024 does not raise a justiciable case or controversy with the January 2024 rating decision for appellate review. In the absence of any justiciable case or controversy, the appeal is moot and therefore, dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105.
