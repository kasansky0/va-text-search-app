REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran serves on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1966 to March 1976 and from August 1978 to October 1983. The Veteran was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal with four Bronze Stars.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991); Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).  Whether the issue is one of an initial rating or an increased rating, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided; separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury only where the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; see also Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Right Shoulder Disabilities

The veteran is seeking higher ratings for his right shoulder disabilities. For the following reasons, the Board finds that a higher 30 percent rating is warranted for his right shoulder disability however a rating greater than 20 percent is not warranted based on limitation of motion.

The Veteran is service connected for two right shoulder disabilities. His right shoulder right shoulder dislocation with osteoarthritis, tendinopathy, tendinosis is currently assigned a 20 percent rating under DC 5003-5202 and his right shoulder dislocation with osteoarthritis, tendinopathy, tendinosis with limitation of motion is currently assigned a 20 percent rating under DC 5024-5201. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27.

The rating criteria for DC 5003 provide that degenerative arthritis established by X-ray findings will be rated based on limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved. When however the limitation of motion of the specific joint involved is noncompensable under the appropriate diagnostic codes, a rating of 10 percent is for application for each such minor joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion, to be combined, not added under diagnostic code 5003. Limitation of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful motion. In the absence of limitation of motion, degenerative arthritis is assigned a 10 percent rating with X-ray evidence of two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups. A maximum 20 percent rating is assigned in the absence of limitation of motion when there is X-ray evidence of two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups, with occasional incapacitating episodes. Note (1) provides that the 20 and 10 percent rating based on X-ray findings will not be combined with ratings based on limitation of motion. Note (2) provides that the 20 and 10 percent ratings based on X-ray findings will not be utilized in rating conditions under diagnostic codes 5013 to 5025, inclusive. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003.

DC 5202 pertains to other impairment of the humerus. A 20 percent rating is assigned for the minor extremity when there is recurrent dislocation of the humerus at the scapulohumeral joint with frequent episodes and guarding of all arm movements; or with infrequent episodes and guarding of movement only at shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction at 90 degrees). A 40 percent rating is when there his fibrous union of the humerus. A 50 percent rating is assigned when there is nonunion (false flail joint) of the humerus. A maximum 70 percent rating is available for loss of head (flail shoulder) of the humerus. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a , DC 5202.

DC 5024 pertains to tenosynovitis, tendinitis, tendinosis or tendinopathy. It notes to evaluate the diseases under diagnostic codes 5013 through 2014 as degenerative arthritis, based on limitation of motion of affected parts. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5024.

DC 5201 pertains to limitation of motion of the arm. A 20 percent rating is assigned when motion of the major extremity is either limited at shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees). A 30 percent rating is warranted when motion is limited to midway between side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees). A maximum 40 percent rating is assigned when flexion and/or abduction of the major extremity is limited to 25 degrees from side. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5201.

In January 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination dated December 2023, for his claim. He was noted to be right hand dominant. The Veteran reported his symptoms as pain and decreased range of motion. Flare-ups were noted to occur twice a month lasting about a week precipitated by sharp pain and the inability to move his arm or bear any weight. Functional impairment was described as being unable to move arm or bear any weight for an extended period of time. Active range of motion testing showed flexion and abduction endpoints to 160 degrees. Pain was exhibited on flexion, abduction, internal rotation, and external rotation. Passive range of motion testing showed flexion and abduction limited to 140 degrees with pain noted on flexion, abduction, internal rotation and external rotation.  This pain was found to further limit flexion and abduction to 130 degrees. After three repetitions the Veteran's flexion and abduction was limited to 110 degrees and after repeated use over time the Veteran's flexion and abduction was limited to 100 degrees. When accounting for flare-ups, the Veteran was found to have flexion and abduction limited to 90 degrees. No ankylosis was found on examination. Hawkins' Impingement test, Empty Can test, external rotation/infraspinatus strength test, and lift-off subscapularis test were all positive. The Veteran was found to have frequent episodes and guarding of all arm movements that affect range of motion. The examiner is competent to make these findings, the Board finds them to be credible, and affords the examination report great probative weight.

VA treatment records are largely silent for any notations regarding the Veteran's shoulder disabilities except for notations pertaining to scaring as well as copies of the Veteran's previous VA exam. 

The Board finds the evidence shows that a 30 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's right shoulder disability under DC 5003-5202. However, a disability rating greater than 20 percent for the Veteran's right shoulder disability based on limitation of motion is not warranted under DC 5024-5201. Regarding the Veteran's right shoulder disability rated under DC 5003-5202, an increased rating of 30 percent is warranted when there is a showing of frequent episodes of guarding. The January 2024 VA examination specifically noted the Veteran to have frequent episodes of guarding consistent with a 30 percent rating under DC 5003-5202. While a 30 percent rating is warranted the Veteran's records do not show fibrous union of the humerus, nonunion of the humerus or loss of head (flail shoulder) of the humerus that would warrant a higher rating. 

Regarding the Veteran's right shoulder disability rating based on limitation of motion, a rating greater than his current 20 percent is not warranted. A 30 percent rating would be warranted with a showing of the Veteran has not exhibited flexion or abduction limited to 45 degrees. Without a showing of limitation of flexion or abduction to 45 degrees a higher rating is not warranted under DC 5024-5201.

The Board has considered if a higher rating could be awarded pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.49. Though pain was noted on examination the Veteran did not show additional factors which would restrict movement to such an extent that the criteria for a higher rating would be justified. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.10, 4.40, 4.45.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence shows the Veteran's right shoulder disability rated under 5003-5202 warrants a 30 percent rating and an increased rating is not warranted for the Veteran's right shoulder based on limitation of motion. 

Left Lower Extremity Radiculopathy

The Veteran's ratings are assigned under various DCs under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. Under DC 8520, a 10 percent rating is assigned for mild incomplete paralysis involving the sciatic nerve. A 20 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis. A 40 percent rating is assigned for moderately severe incomplete paralysis. A 60 percent rating is assigned for severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy. A maximum 80 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve where the foot dangle and drops, no active movement possible of muscle below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520.

DC 8526, which addresses paralysis of the anterior crural (femoral) nerve. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 30 disabling. Complete paralysis of the quadriceps extensor muscle is rated as 40 percent disabling.

DCs 8528, 8529, and 8530 address paralysis of the obturator nerve, the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh, and the ilio-inguinal nerve respectively. For each of these DCs a noncompensable evaluation is assigned for mild or moderate paralysis. A maximum 10 percent rating is assigned for severe to complete paralysis.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2023. The Veteran reported tingling, numbness, and weakness in the left lower extremity. Muscle testing showed the Veteran to have decreased muscle strength on left knee extension, left ankle plantar flexion, and left ankle dorsiflexion. The Veteran was also found to have hypoactive reflexes of the left knee and ankle. A sensory exam found the Veteran to have decreased sensation in the left upper anterior thigh, the thigh/knee and the lower leg/ankle. There were no noted trophic changes and the Veteran's gait was normal.

Sciatic Nerve

The Veteran is presently rated at 20 percent under DC 8520 for his left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2023 regarding his peripheral nerves. The examiner, based on the above exam, found the Veteran to have moderate incomplete paralysis of the left sciatic nerve.

Notably, the Veteran's medical records are silent for any complaints or notations regarding any issues with the sciatic nerve. 

Based on the above evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's current 20 percent rating is appropriate. The evidence shows that the Veteran has experienced moderate symptoms of radiculopathy in his left lower extremity sciatic nerve. Specifically, he has exhibited decreased sensation and moderate pain. 

Though the Veteran did exhibit decreased muscle strength and decreased sensation, this was not to an extent that the Board could find the Veteran's incomplete paralysis to be moderately severe.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against awarding a rating higher than 20 percent. Therefore, the claim for an increased rating is denied.

Femoral Nerve

The Veteran is presently rated at 20 percent under DC 8520 for his left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve. 

As discussed above, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2023 regarding his peripheral nerves. The examiner, based on the above exam, found the Veteran to have moderate incomplete paralysis of the left femoral nerve.

Notably, the Veteran's medical records are silent for any complaints or notations regarding any issues with the femoral nerve. 

Based on the above evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's current 20 percent rating is appropriate. The evidence shows that the Veteran has experienced moderate symptoms of radiculopathy in his left lower extremity femoral nerve. He has exhibited decreased sensation and moderate pain of the left lower extremities. Though the Veteran did exhibit decreased muscle strength and decreased sensation of the left lower extremities, this was not to an extent that the Board could find the Veteran's incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerve to be moderately severe.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against awarding a rating higher than 20 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the left lower extremity. Therefore, the claim for an increased rating is denied.

Obturator Nerve, External Cutaneous Nerve of the Thigh, and Ilio-Inguinal Nerve

The Veteran is presently rated at 0 percent under DC 8528, 8529, and 8530 for his left lower extremity radiculopathy of the obturator nerve, the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh, and the ilio-inguinal nerve respectively. 

The November 2023 examiner, based on the above exam, found the Veteran to have moderate incomplete paralysis of the left obturator and cutaneous nerves and mild incomplete paralysis of the ilio-inguinal nerve.

Notably, the Veteran's medical records are silent for any complaints or notations regarding any issues with the obturator nerve, the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh, and the ilio-inguinal nerve respectively. 

Based on the above evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's noncompensable rating is appropriate. The evidence shows that the Veteran has experienced moderate symptoms of radiculopathy in his left lower extremity obturator and cutaneous nerves and mild symptoms in his ilio-inguinal nerve. He has exhibited decreased sensation and moderate pain. 

As described above, though the Veteran did exhibit decreased muscle strength and decreased sensation, this was not to an extent that the Board could find the Veteran's incomplete paralysis to be severe enough to warrant a compensable rating under DCs 8528, 8529, or 8530 respectively.
