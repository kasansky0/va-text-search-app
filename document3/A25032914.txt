ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his tinnitus is related to his military service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1986 to October 1990.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 supplemental rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In September 2024, the appellant submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran contends that he experiences tinnitus related to his service.

A veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation if there is a current disability resulting from a personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131.

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established by evidencing a chronic disease in service, including tinnitus and other organic diseases of the nervous system, requires a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), 3.309.  If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge is required.  Id.  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) pertaining to continuity of symptomatology can be applied only in cases involving those conditions explicitly recognized under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may be granted for disability shown after service, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, shows that it was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record . A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Following a review of the evidence and applicable legal criteria, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss is warranted.

Here, the record shows that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with tinnitus.  In addition, VA has conceded in-service noise exposure.  See October 2023 rating decision; October 2023 VA Examination.  As such, the first and second elements of service connection have been met and the salient question is whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to service.

In this regard the Veteran has submitted a private opinion indicating that the Veteran's disability is related to service and VA has obtained a medical opinion in which a VA examiner opined that the disability is less likely than not related to service.  See October 2023 VA Examination; September 2023 Private Medical Opinion. 

Certain elements of both the positive and negative medical opinions and clinical evidence of record in this case are probative.  All of the medical opinions and clinical evidence have their respective flaws as well.  But there is no apparent basis for wholly rejecting the favorable medical opinions and clinical evidence of record. In light of the contrasting, yet equally probative medical opinions and clinical evidence in the present case, in such situations, the benefit of the doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to active-duty service.  Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, service connection for tinnitus is warranted and the claim is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
