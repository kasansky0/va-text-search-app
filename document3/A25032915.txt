REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Navy from September 1994 to July 2001. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2019 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) (the "May 2019 Rating Decision"). 

In July 2019, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the hearing docket.  In October 2023, the Veteran was afforded a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge; a transcript of that hearing is of record (the "October 2023 Board Hearing").  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2019 Rating Decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or the Veteran's representative at the October 2023 Board Hearing or within ninety (90) days following the hearing.  See 38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a).  

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  See id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

INCREASED RATINGS

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects their ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing their symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.10. If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. However, where an increase in the disability rating, rather than the propriety of the initial rating, is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance, and past medical reports should not take precedence over current findings. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Regardless of whether an appeal stems from disagreement with the initial rating assigned following an award of service connection or from disagreement with the rating assigned following a claim for increase, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007) (citing Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999)).

1. A 50 percent initial rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's service-connected endometriosis is granted.

The May 2019 Rating Decision awarded the Veteran service connection for endometriosis and assigned a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7629, effective October 25, 2018; however, the Veteran asserts that her service-connected endometriosis warrants a higher rating due to the severity of her symptoms.  As further explained below, the Board agrees and finds that a 50 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's service-connected endometriosis throughout the claim period.

Diagnostic Code 7629 governs endometriosis and provides as follows: (1) a 50 percent evaluation is warranted where the evidence of record demonstrates lesions involving the bowel or bladder confirmed by laparoscopy; pelvic pain or heavy or irregular bleeding not controlled by treatment; and bowel or bladder symptoms; (2) a 30 percent evaluation is warranted where the evidence of record demonstrates pelvic pain or heavy or irregular bleeding not controlled by treatment; and (3) a 10 percent evaluation is warranted where the evidence of record demonstrates pelvic pain or heavy or irregular bleeding requiring continuous treatment for control.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.116, Diagnostic Code 7629.  A diagnosis of endometriosis must be substantiated by laparoscopy.  See id., Note 1.

Turning to the evidence of record, in April 2019, the Veteran was afforded a VA gynecological examination to evaluate the service-connected endometriosis, which culminated in a report (the "April 2019 VA Gynecological Report") diagnosing the Veteran with endometriosis substantiated by multiple laparoscopies and pelvic pain and noting the following: (1) in 1990, the Veteran was diagnosed with endometriosis manifested by excruciatingly painful and debilitating heavy menstrual cycles; (2) in 2001, the Veteran underwent a hysterectomy with right salingoophorectomy; (3) the Veteran's endometriosis manifests moderate intermittent pelvic pain; (4) the Veteran underwent multiple laparoscopies which confirmed bowel adhesions that caused extreme constipation; (5) the Veteran was treated with prescription opioid medication for pain management (tramadol); and monthly Lupron injections for more than six (6) months; and (6) the Veteran's symptoms are not controlled by continuous treatment resulted in functional impact as she missed work due to medical appointments and significant pain.

VA treatment records dated January and July 2018 further reflect the following: (1) in January 2018, the Veteran was treated for endometriosis and "a lot of pain," including continuous aching radiating pain in the right lower quadrant; (2) a January 2018 computed tomography (CT) scan was positive for a large hypodense focus (mass) in the expected location of the right adnexa (fallopian tubes); (3) prior to the 2001 hysterectomy, the Veteran was diagnosed with endometriosis and treated with Lupron injections; (4) the Veteran underwent multiple surgeries, including five (5) laparoscopies which confirmed endometriosis with multiple adhesions; (5) the Veteran underwent an ultrasound which diagnosed a right ovarian cyst; (6) the Veteran underwent a pelvic MRI which diagnosed a simple peritoneal cyst; and (7) the Veteran also suffers from chronic abdominal pain; severe constipation; and chronic pelvic pain.

At the October 2023 Board Hearing before the undersigned, the Veteran testified that she continued to suffer from uncontrolled pain due to the service-connected endometriosis throughout the period on appeal, that she has undergone seven (7) laparoscopies to assess the endometrial adhesions, and that the adhesions have impacted both her bladder and bowel.   

Accordingly, in light of the evidence of record, and resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that her service-connected endometriosis manifests severe pelvic pain not controlled by treatment and bowel adhesions confirmed by laparoscopy, such that a 50 percent maximum rating under Diagnostic Code 7629 is warranted throughout the claim period.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.116. 

In reaching the above conclusions, the Board has considered the benefit of the doubt doctrine and has applied it in assigning a maximum 50 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5269 throughout the claim period.  However, as the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a rating higher than 50 percent under any other diagnostic code, to that extent the doctrine is not applicable.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021).

2. A 30 percent rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's service-connected gastrointestinal disability, diagnosed as hiatal hernia with GERD, IBS, and gastroparesis, is granted effective September 26, 2018.

In January 2003, the Veteran was awarded service connection for GERD and IBS and assigned separate noncompensable ratings under Diagnostic Codes 7399-7346 and 7319, respectively, effective July 16, 2001, the date of the Veteran's separation from service.  In the May 2019 Rating Decision, the AOJ awarded an increased rating of 10 percent under Diagnostic Code 7319-7346 for the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability, diagnosed as hiatal hernia with GERD, IBS, and gastroparesis, effective October 25, 2018; however, the Veteran asserts that her service-connected gastrointestinal disability warrants a higher rating due to the severity of her symptoms.  As further explained below, the Board agrees and finds that a 30 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's service-connected gastrointestinal disability effective September 26, 2018, when worsening was first factually ascertainable during the lookback period of this claim for increase. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Because the VA Rating Schedule did not include a diagnostic code expressly pertaining to GERD until regulatory amendments became effective in May 2024, the Veteran's service-connected gastrointestinal disability is currently evaluated by analogy under Diagnostic Code 7319-7346.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  The period under review and the evidentiary record before the Board predate the May 2024 amendments, so the pre-amendment criteria will be applied. The Board has considered whether rating the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability under a different code would be more appropriate but finds there is no more appropriate code in this case. 

Turning to the applicable pre-amendment regulations, ratings under Diagnostic Codes 7301 to 7329, inclusive, Diagnostic Codes 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348, inclusive, may not be combined with each other; instead, a single evaluation must be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 (2023).  Accordingly, the Board has assigned a single rating for the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability under Diagnostic Code 7346, which reflects the Veteran's predominant disability picture. 

Diagnostic Code 7346 governs hiatal hernias and provides as follows: (1) a 60 percent evaluation is warranted where the evidence of record demonstrates symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss, and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health; (2) a 30 percent evaluation is warranted where the evidence of record demonstrates symptoms of persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health; and (3) a 10 percent evaluation is warranted where the evidence of record demonstrates two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 (2023).

Diagnostic Code 7319 governs irritable colon syndrome and provides as follows: (1) a noncompensable rating is warranted for mild irritable colon syndrome with disturbances of bowel function with occasional episodes of abdominal distress; (2) a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate irritable colon syndrome with frequent episodes of bowel disturbances with abdominal distress; and (3) a maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for severe irritable colon syndrome with diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7319 (2023). Irritable colon is synonymous with irritable bowel. See Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary 395 (2016).

The terms "mild," "moderate," and "severe" are not defined in the VA Rating Schedule. As with any regulatory interpretation containing undefined terms, it is presumed that such terms carry their ordinary dictionary meaning.  See Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 336 (2018).  Therefore, the Board finds that these terms are unambiguous and, therefore, a plain dictionary meaning provides an appropriate definition.  Cf. Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019).

Turning, then, to the dictionary meanings, the adjective "mild" is defined as "moderate in action or effect" and "not severe; temperate."  Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 787 (11th ed. 2003).  The adjective "moderate" is defined as "tending toward the mean or average amount."  Id. at 787.  The adjective "severe" is defined as "of a great degree" or "serious."  Id. at 1140.  Although a medical examiner's use of descriptive terminology such as "mild" constitutes an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, it is not dispositive of an issue, as the Board must evaluate all evidence of record in rendering a decision.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

In light of the following, and after careful review, the Board finds that for the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected gastrointestinal disability manifested severe symptoms, with more or less constant abdominal distress, including the following: persistently recurrent epigastric distress; pyrosis; regurgitation; reflux; dysphagia; nausea; vomiting; bloating; abdominal pain; diarrhea; and severe constipation, resulting in considerable impairment of health, as required by Diagnostic Code 7346 in order to warrant a 30 percent rating.  Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected gastrointestinal disability warrants a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7346, and to that extent the claim is granted. 

Turning to the evidence of record, in January 2019, the Veteran was afforded a VA esophageal examination to evaluate her service-connected GERD, which culminated in a report (the "January 2019 VA Esophageal Report") diagnosing the Veteran with GERD which manifests the following symptoms: persistently recurrent epigastric distress; pyrosis; regurgitation; reflux; dysphagia; bloating; abdominal pain; four or more nausea episodes per year lasting one to nine days; and four or more vomiting episodes per year lasting one to nine days.  The January 2019 VA Esophageal Report further indicates that the Veteran was diagnosed with hiatal hernia; gastroparesis; mild chronic gastritis; and antral erosion, and that her condition results in a functional impact causing her to miss work and take leave without pay at least four times per month. 

In January 2019, the Veteran was also afforded a VA intestinal examination to evaluate her service-connected IBS, which culminated in a report (the "January 2019 VA Intestinal Report") diagnosing the Veteran with IBS-constipation which manifests the following symptoms: severe constipation resulting in bowel movements only every six to twelve days; recurrent nausea; vomiting; abdominal distension; and lower abdominal cramping and discomfort.  The January 2019 VA Intestinal Report further indicates as follows: (1) the Veteran was treated on an emergent basis in October 2018 for severe constipation; (2) the Veteran has undergone colonoscopies for recurrent constipation in November 2014; June 2016; and November 2018; (3) she has been treated with a liquid diet and prescribed medications, including magnesium citrate; stool softener; Zofran; and laxatives; (4) the Veteran suffers from frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress as well as episodes of exacerbations and/or attacks occurring approximately three times in the prior twelve months and which typically involve severe constipation; nausea; vomiting; and abdominal discomfort; and (5) the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability results in functional impairment and negatively impacts physical and sedentary employment during exacerbations and attacks.

A VA treatment record dated September 26, 2018 documents the Veteran's report that her GERD symptoms had gotten worse. She endorsed nausea with intermittent vomiting that seemed to worsen when medication used to treat her service-connected psychiatric disability was increased.

VA treatment records dated October 2018 reflect that the Veteran was treated by a gastrointestinal specialist for nausea; vomiting four to five times the day prior; four to five episodes of diarrhea; and right upper quadrant abdominal pain.

VA treatment records dated March and April 2019 further reflect that the Veteran was diagnosed with chronic, severe constipation, including constipation for more than ten (10) days, and that she was prescribed magnesium citrate twice weekly for "severe constipation."

In light of the medical evidence of record, and resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that her service-connected gastrointestinal disability has manifested persistently recurrent epigastric distress; pyrosis; regurgitation; reflux; dysphagia; bloating; abdominal pain and distension; lower abdominal cramping and discomfort; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; and severe constipation, all of which results in considerable impairment of health, such that a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7346 is warranted. Based on the Veteran's statements to a VA clinician on September 26, 2018, the Board finds that an increase in disability was first factually ascertainable on that date.  

The Board further finds that for the entire claim period, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's service-connected gastrointestinal disability manifested symptoms that approximate the criteria for a 60 percent rating, as the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability did not manifest material, or any, weight loss; hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or any other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114.  The Board further finds that the symptoms listed in the criteria for a 60 percent rating to describe a disability picture likely to produce "severe impairment of health" are more severe than any listed or unlisted symptoms associated with the Veteran's disability picture, described above, and therefore, the criteria for a 30 percent rating are most closely approximated.

In reaching the above conclusions, the Board has considered the benefit of the doubt doctrine and has applied it in assigning a 30 percent rating effective September 26, 2018.  However, as the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a rating higher than 30 percent, to that extent the doctrine is not applicable.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

WITHDRAWN CLAIMS

1. The issue of entitlement to service connection for an allergy to latex and Carbocaine is dismissed.

2. The issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD is dismissed.

3. The issue of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected umbilical scar is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

In the present case, the Veteran testified at the October 2023 Board Hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge that she wished to withdraw the appeals of the following issues: (1) the denial of service connection for an allergy to latex and Carbocaine; (2) the denial of an increased rating for the service-connected PTSD; and (3) the denial of an increased rating for the service-connected umbilical scar.  

At the hearing, the undersigned Veterans Law Judge explained that if the Veteran wished to pursue those issues in the future, she would have to refile at the regional office level and that withdrawal could impact the effective date of any benefits.  The Veteran expressed understanding and the continued desire to withdraw the appeal as to all three (3) issues.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's withdrawal as to those issues is explicit, unambiguous, and completed with a full understanding of the consequences of such action.  See Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009, 1011 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011)) (internal quotations omitted).

?

Hence, as there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration with respect to the claims for service connection for an allergy to latex and Carbocaine and for increased ratings for the service-connected PTSD and umbilical scar, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review those issues on appeal, and they are dismissed.
