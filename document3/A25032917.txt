CONCLUSION OF LAW

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of two separate June 2023 decisions; a June 15, 2023 decision that granted service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, effective April 29, 2023 and found basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA), effective April 29, 2023; and a June 29, 2023 decision that denied service connection for left shoulder bicipital tendonitis. The Veteran was notified of these decisions by correspondence dated June 19, 2023, and July 3, 2023, respectively. In July 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 decisions. The Veteran was notified of the HLR decision by correspondence dated July 27, 2023. 

In August 2023 the Veteran, through counsel, submitted two different VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement); one 10182 reflected election of the Evidence Submission docket, and the other 10182 reflected election of the Direct Review docket. In August 2023 the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) informed the Veteran and his counsel that his appeal had been docketed on the Direct Review docket. In January 2025 the Board advised the Veteran that his appeal request was procedurally inadequate: in light of the two different docket elections filed on the same day, the Board advised the Veteran and his counsel that for the Board to process his appeal he must submit one or more additional VA Form 10182s clearly identifying which issues he sought to appeal under which docket. 

In January 2025 the Veteran, through counsel, submitted a VA Form 10182 electing for Direct Review of the effective dates assigned for his right lower extremity radiculopathy and his basic eligibility for DEA.

In March 2025 the Veteran, through counsel, submitted another VA Form 10182 electing the Evidence Submission docket and seeking review of the effective dates assigned for his right lower extremity radiculopathy and his basic eligibility for DEA as well as the denial of service connection for left shoulder bicipital tendonitis. This filing included a note requesting that the Board "PLEASE USE THIS FILING, EVIDENCE DOCKET PLEASE! [sic]" The Board here notes that this 10182 incorrectly identifies the date of the rating decision relating to the left shoulder claim. 

On the same day in March 2025 the Veteran, through counsel, submitted a fifth VA Form 10182, reflecting election of the Direct Review docket and identifying only the right lower extremity radiculopathy and DEA claims as the issues on appeal. This fifth VA Form 10182 included a note requesting that the Board "PLEASE DISREGARD FAX from TWO MINUTES AGO as this was in error. PLEASE DOCKET ON BVA DIRECT DOCKET. [sic]"

A Notice of Disagreement must be properly completed on a form prescribed by the Secretary. If the agency of original jurisdiction decision addressed several issues, the Notice of Disagreement must identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). Upon filing the Notice of Disagreement, the claimant must indicate whether they request direct review; a Board hearing with opportunity to submit additional evidence; or an opportunity to submit additional evidence without a Board hearing. § 20.202(b). A claimant may modify their review option selection within one year from the date that the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement, whichever is later. § 20.202(c). 

If the Board receives a timely Notice of Disagreement completed on the form prescribed by the Secretary, but the Board cannot identify which denied issue or issues the claimant wants to appeal or which review option the claimant intends to select, then the Board will contact the claimant to request clarification of the claimant's intent. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f). Following clarification, the unclear Notice of Disagreement is considered properly completed, and thereby filed, under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). 

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran has completed his August 2023 Notice of Disagreement by submission of the fifth VA Form 10182 identifying the issues on appeal as entitlement to earlier effective dates for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy and basic eligibility for DEA. More than one year has elapsed since the Veteran was notified of the July 2023 HLR decision on appeal, and more than 60 days has elapsed since VA received the completed August 2023 VA Notice of Disagreement. Accordingly, the period to select a different review option has elapsed, and only the issues of entitlement to earlier effective dates for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy and basic eligibility for DEA are presently on appeal before the Board. 

As discussed above, the Veteran has elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to an earlier effective date for basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to an effective date of March 13, 2021, for service connection of radiculopathy, right lower extremity is granted. 

In adjudicating claims for VA benefits, the burden of proof only requires an "approximate balance" of the evidence for and against a claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-56 (1991). This low standard of proof is "unique" to the VA adjudicatory process, and "the nation, 'in recognition of our debt to our veterans,' has 'taken upon itself the risk of error' in awarding such benefits." Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014). In evaluating a claim for disability benefits, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, a claimant may indicate their desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  If VA receives a complete application form appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. Id. 

VA received the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for left and right (bilateral) lower extremity radiculopathy in April 2021, following a March 13, 2021, Intent to File. 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Entitlement to service connection may be established on a secondary basis where there is evidence of (1) a current, non-service-connected disability, (2) a current service-connected disability, and (3) evidence that the non-service-connected disability is either (i) proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability or (ii) aggravated (increased in severity) beyond its natural progression by a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 446 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The AOJ's grant of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy in a June 2023 rating decision reflects the findings that the Veteran's current right lower extremity radiculopathy is proximately due to his service connected lumbar spine disability. Accordingly, for the purposes of determining an appropriate effective date, the question is when the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy manifested. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2021. 08/09/2021, C&P Exam. The examiner documented the Veteran's report of sharp, radiating pain in the left lower extremity. The examiner documented the Veteran's report that his right lower extremity was not affected. On examination, the examiner documented signs and symptoms of left lower extremity radiculopathy; the examiner documented no signs and/or symptoms of right lower extremity radiculopathy. 

In April 2023 VA received a lay statement from the Veteran in which he described experiencing radiating pain in both legs for many years. The Veteran stated that at the July 2021 VA examination he had reported daily discomfort and tingling with frequent spasms in his right leg, but that he had described his left leg symptoms as more severe.  04/12/2023, VA Form 21-10210 - Lay Witness Statement. The Veteran stated that he must have been misunderstood by the July 2021 VA examiner.

In May 2023 VA received a written statement from a non-VA treating provider describing the Veteran's symptoms of nerve pain with numbness and tingling in both legs, as well as his low back and hips. This statement reflects that the provider had been treating the Veteran for approximately 7 years. 

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in June 2023. The June 2023 VA examiner documented a diagnosis of right lower extremity radiculopathy. The June 2023 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran reported having been diagnosed with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy by a VA treating provider. 

The Board here notes that the Veteran's April 2021 claim specifically reflects the Veteran's claim of service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy, in addition to a lumbar spine disability claim. Notwithstanding this specific claim by the Veteran, he was not afforded a VA examination specific to his lower extremity radiculopathy claim in July 2021. Rather, findings as to his lower extremity radiculopathy claim were limited to those made in the course of evaluating his claimed lumbar spine disability. Conversely, when the Veteran's claim was readjudicated in 2023, he was afforded an evaluation specific to his lower extremity radiculopathy claim. The more detailed June 2023 VA examination report reflects sensation testing for light touch, with showed decreased sensation to light touch for the right lower extremity, as well as other evaluations not made in the course of the July 2021 lumbar spine examination. 

Bearing in mind the limitations of the July 2021 VA examination as compared to the more detailed June 2023 VA examination, and in consideration of the totality of the record, the Board finds that the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran had a right lower extremity radiculopathy disability at the time of his March 2021 claim. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the criteria for entitlement to an effective date of March 13, 2021, for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy are met, and the same is hereby granted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35  is remanded.

Basic eligibility for Chapter 35 DEA benefits is derived in one of several ways, including being a child, spouse, or surviving spouse of a veteran who has a permanent total service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807. 

In the June 2023 rating decision which was subject to HLR, the AOJ assigned an initial 20 percent rating for the Veteran's newly service connected right lower extremity radiculopathy. As discussed above, the Board has assigned an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection. However, the Board may not assign a disability rating for the newly extended period of service connection in the first instance. 38 U.S.C. § 7104. Accordingly, the Board finds that remand is required to permit the AOJ to adjudicate the matter of an appropriate disability rating for the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy for the period from March 13, 2021. See e.g., Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394, 399 (2010).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Adjudicate the matter of an appropriate disability rating for the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy for the period from March 13, 2021.
