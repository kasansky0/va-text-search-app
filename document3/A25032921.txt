ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for lung disability, with chronic cough and phlegm, is dismissed.                   

FINDING OF FACT

In a September 25, 2024, rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for restrictive lung condition, unspecified (also claimed as lung issues, chronic cough phlegm) on a direct basis, effective November 18, 2022, the day on which VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, the same claim that is before the Board.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the Veteran's appeal of the denial of the claim for entitlement to service connection for lung disability, with chronic cough and phlegm, docketed in appeal stream 240928-477165, have been met, as the benefit sought has been granted in full and there remains no specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Coast Guard from October 2009 to October 2013.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an appeal of a January 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In the rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for "lung issues, chronic cough phlegm."

In his September 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket.  Under this AMA docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board will not consider evidence added to the record after the date of the AOJ decision on appeal.  If evidence was added during this ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.

If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).   If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

Dismissal of the Claim for Entitlement to Service Connection for Lung Disability, with Chronic Cough and Phlegm

The threshold question before the Board is whether the appeal based on the Veteran's VA Form 10182, received in August 2024, docket number 240928-477165, can be adjudicated as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for lung disability, with chronic cough and phlegm.  While the grant of service connection is generally considered a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal, Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (where an appealed claim for service connection is granted during the pendency of the appeal, a second Notice of Disagreement must thereafter be timely filed to initiate appellate review of "downstream" issues such as the compensation level assigned for the disability or the effective date of service connection), the Board cannot dismiss an appeal from the denial of service connection for a disability for which service connection has already been granted without considering the effective date consequences of the grant of service connection on another basis.  Johnson v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-7589, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 383 (Mar. 26, 2025).  Consideration of effective date consequences would also be appropriate if the claim that the AOJ granted was filed later than the claim on appeal to the Board, as the grant of the latter could in that situation result in an earlier effective date.  Id.

Here, however, the AOJ in September 2024 granted service connection for restrictive lung condition, unspecified (also claimed as lung issues, chronic cough phlegm), and assigned a noncompensable rating, effective November 18, 2022.  As noted above, the effective date represents the date that VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, seeking service connection for this disability.  This is the same claim form that was the basis for the claim that was denied in the January 2024 rating decision on appeal.  Moreover, the grant of service connection in the September 2024 rating decision was on a direct basis and therefore there is no other theory of entitlement upon which service connection could be granted that would result in an earlier effective date. Stender v. Wilkie, No. 19-0068, 2020 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 520, *5-*7 (Mar. 27, 2020) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) (the Board erred in granting service connection based on the Camp Lejeune Contaminated Water (CLCW) presumption without considering other theories of entitlement that could warrant an earlier effective date because of the effective date of the CLCW presumption); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

As the grant of the claim for service connection for lung disability, with chronic cough and phlegm, that is before the Board in docket number 240928-477165 could not result in an earlier effective date or any other benefit to the Veteran beyond that which was granted by the AOJ in the September 2024 rating decision granting service connection for this disability, there is no remaining determination with which the claimant disagrees and dismissal of the appeal is therefore warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).
