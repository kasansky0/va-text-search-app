FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 2013 to July 2022.  

On April 18, 2022, the Veteran filed a disability claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for service connection of left and right upper extremity radiculopathy and left and right lower extremity radiculopathy.  On November 29, 2022, the VA Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision denying service connection for all claims.

On November 29, 2022, the Veteran filed a higher-level review claim for service connection of left and right upper extremity radiculopathy and left and right lower extremity radiculopathy with the VA.  On February 14, 2023, the RO issued a rating decision confirming and continuing denial of service connection for all claims.  

On November 21, 2023, the Veteran appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request.  In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the readjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the modernized review system, the Board must remand appeals to the RO to correct pre-decision duty-to-assist errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Here, the record reveals duty-to-assist errors that occurred prior to the June 2024 rating decision; therefore, a remand is required to correct the errors.  Id.  

Legal Criteria

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131;?38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Service connection can be established on a presumptive, direct, or secondary basis. This case concerns the latter of the three theories of relief.

To establish entitlement to service connection on a secondary basis, there must be (1) a current disability; (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) a nexus between the service-connected disability and the current disability. Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998), superseded by statute, 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a).    

Because the legal landscape has shifted appreciably on the question of secondary service connection, the Board believes the following explication will be of some small service to the cause of justice and judicial economy and efficiency-the avoidance of remands.  

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) had recent occasion to consider matters relevant to the instant case and their holding illuminates the Board's way (and the RO's on remand).

In Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023), the Federal Circuit held that under the causation standard of section 1110 of Title 38 of the United States Code, secondary service connection is warranted where a nonservice-connected disability would have been less severe "but-for"  a service connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.  Id. at 1365.

In the same case, the Federal Circuit expressly held that section 3.310(b) of Title 38 of Code of Federal Regulations, the regulation that would otherwise control the outcome here, is unlawful because it is inconsistent with section 1110 of Title 38 of the United States Code.  Id. at 1366. 

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d. 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  

Analysis - Right and Left Upper Extremity Radiculopathy

The Veteran seeks service connection for right and left upper extremity radiculopathy, secondary to his upper back injury.  See April 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Veteran is currently service connected for cervical spine degenerative changes since July 28, 2022.

The Veteran submitted private medical records.  See April 2022, Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility.  On July 20, 2021, the Veteran reported neck pain that radiates to both arms.  The pain will cause his arms to feel tingly and numb, occasionally his pain will radiate all the way down to his pinkies.  On August 4, 2021, the Veteran's records show a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy.  On September 17, 2021, the Veteran reported chronic neck pain with occasional radiation of pain into the bilateral arms, accompanied with intermittent paresthesias.  The examiner assessed the Veteran to have arm and hand paresthesia.

On May 25, 2022, the Veteran was seen by a VA examiner.  At that examination, the Veteran reported constant neck pain that goes down his arms causing numbness and tingling to his pinkies.  The VA examiner found the Veteran did not have right or left upper extremity radiculopathy.  The examiner noted the Veteran's subjective symptoms, however found there was no objective medical record evidence to support a diagnosis of cervical spine radiculopathy.  

The Board finds the May 2022 VA medical examination inadequate for adjudicative purposes.  The VA examiner failed to address the Veteran's private medical records showing a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy.  Additionally, the VA examiner failed to adequately address the Veteran's subjective symptoms and lay statements of his symptoms.  Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 258-60 (2020) (unless the Board finds the lay statements not competent or not credible, an examiner's opinion must address the Veteran's relevant lay statements to include enough detail to inform the Board's decision.  Failure to do so renders that opinion inadequate).

The Board finds remand is necessary to correct the above pre-decisional duty-to- assist error and fulfill the RO's duty to assist.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

Analysis- Right and Left Lower Extremity Radiculopathy

The Veteran seeks service connection for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy, secondary to his lower back injury.  See April 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Veteran is currently service connection for lumbar spondylosis since July 28, 2022.  

The Veteran submitted private medical records.  See April 2022, Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility.  On July 20, 2021, the Veteran reported low back pain that radiates down to his left leg and foot.  On September 17, 2021, the Veteran reported pain in his lower back with occasional bilateral leg pain and left leg numbness and tingling.  The examiner assessed the Veteran to have chronic low back pain with left sided radiculopathy, lower back pain with intermittent bilateral radiculopathy, and mild lumbar spondylosis with facet degenerative changes.  On November 11, 2021, the Veteran was assessed with lumbar radiculopathy and complex regional pain syndrome of the lower limbs.

On May 25, 2022, the Veteran was seen by a VA examiner.  At that examination, the Veteran reported intermittent pain that goes down both legs to his big toes and causes numbness.  The VA examiner found the Veteran did not have right or left lower extremity radiculopathy.  The examiner stated: 

Objective medical evidence of LS spine MRI, negative for BLE EMG, no benefit from ESI and diagnostic L1 lumbar sympathetic block do not support the diagnosis of BLE radiculopathy.  The veteran's 'radicular' symptoms were finally diagnosed as chronic regional pain syndrome of the right leg.  See DBQs Hip and Knee.

See May 2022, C&P Exam.

The Board finds the May 2022 VA medical examination inadequate for adjudicative purposes.  The VA examiner failed to address the Veteran's private medical records showing a diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy, separate and apart from his chronic regional pain syndrome.  Additionally, the VA examiner failed to adequately address the Veteran's subjective symptoms and lay statements.  Miller, 32 Vet. App. at 258-60.

The Board finds remand is necessary to correct the above pre-decisional duty-to- assist error and fulfill the RO's duty to assist.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate examiner. Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA examiner regarding the etiology of the Veteran's conditions, if diagnosed.  The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand decision, must be made available to, and reviewed by, the clinician.  If a diagnosis is made, the reviewing clinician must opine on:

(a)	Whether it is approximately at least as likely as not that the service-connected cervical spine degenerative changes, were a "but-for cause" of (caused an increase in the severity of, or an inability to treat) the Veteran's right and left upper extremity condition?  Spicer, 61 F.4th at 1364-66.

(b)	Whether it is approximately at least as likely as not that the service-connected lumbar spondylosis, was a "but-for cause" of (caused an increase in the severity of, or an inability to treat) the Veteran's right and left lower extremity condition?  Id.

A complete rationale, including citation to appropriate medical principles, for the opinion reached must be provided. 

The examiner is respectfully reminded that the absence   of in-service evidence of disability is not fatal to a service connection claim. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. at 89 (1992).
