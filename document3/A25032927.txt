FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence weighs persuasively against an effective date earlier than October 14, 2015, for a 20 percent evaluation for service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve.

2. An August 2016 rating decision established service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve, as associated with the service-connected low back disability, effective from October 14, 2015, and assigned an initial 20 percent rating. However, the Veteran did not perfect a legacy appeal on the issue of an earlier effective date for the award of service connection, or the assignment of the 20 percent rating, such that the Veteran had not continuously pursued these issues. 

3. The earliest date of claim for the issue of the right lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve, was October 14, 2015. 

4. The earliest date of entitlement for a 20 percent evaluation for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy, as shown in VA treatment records, was not ascertainable until November 2015. 

5. The earliest date of entitlement for a current disability of left lower extremity radiculopathy, as shown in VA treatment records, was ascertainable since at least July 2010. 

6. Since the November 30, 2018 claim, the Veteran has continuously pursued earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral and sciatic nerves, and service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, femoral nerve.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1969 to November 1971.

In a March 2022 rating decision, under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied an increased rating for the low back disability, earlier effective dates and increased ratings for the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies involving the femoral and sciatic nerves, and earlier effective dates for a TDIU and DEA eligibility. In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a Higher Level Review (HLR) request for review of the March 2022 decision. In a June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2022 rating decision.

The Veteran appealed the issues of an increased rating for the low back disability, and increased ratings and earlier effective dates for the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies, and earlier effective dates for a TDIU and DEA eligibility, in a May 2024 VA Form 10182 (AMA notice of disagreement (NOD)) to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board). The Veteran appealed from the June 2023 HLR rating decision under the Direct Review appeal docket. So, based on the Veteran's selections of the HLR and Direct Review options, the Board's present review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the March 2022 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601, 20.301. 

Effective Dates

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) created a new framework for veterans dissatisfied with VA's decisions on their claims to seek review. Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017). The AMA became effective February 19, 2019, and applies to decisions (AMA decisions) notified by VA on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2; 3.2400. Decisions notified prior to the effective date of the AMA (February 19, 2019) are considered legacy claims subject to the legacy appeal framework.

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless otherwise provided. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, in the context of claims for an earlier effective date for an increased rating, if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable) controls the effective date for an increased rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997). Determining the appropriate effective date for an increased rating under the effective date regulations involves an analysis of the evidence to determine (1) when a claim for an increased rating was received and, if possible, (2) when the increase in disability actually occurred. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400 (o)(2).

To preserve an effective date, an intent to file a claim may be submitted to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought within one-year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. 

Further, for AMA appeals, as here, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h) controls the assignment of effective dates. Under that provision, the effective date will be the date VA received a veteran's initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a veteran continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in § 3.2500 (c) within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(1). Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c), a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing administrative review options after any decision by the AOJ, Board, or U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. "Continuously pursued issues" include that following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c)(1).

1. An earlier effective date than October 14, 2015, for a 20 percent evaluation for the service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve.

As an initial matter, the Veteran's VA treatment records show the earliest date of entitlement was on approximately November 17, 2015, when he was noted to have increasing pain with radicular symptoms into the right lower extremity. Next, in January 2016, the Veteran reported excruciating back pain that shoots all the way down his right lower extremity and makes standing/ambulating almost impossible. Notably, in a March 2016 VA back conditions examination, the examiner noted the Veteran's complaints of low back pain with shooting pains down the back of his right leg. The examiner diagnosed degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, and also indicated the Veteran had mild severity of right lower extremity radiculopathy involving the sciatic nerve. Thus, entitlement was established as early as November 2015. 

Concerning the date of claim, the Veteran filed an Intent to File a claim on October 14, 2015 and followed up with an October 2015 claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) for an increased rating for his service-connected low back condition. Because the Veteran submitted a complete application within one year of the date of the intent to file a claim, the Board considers his complete claim for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve, as associated with the service-connected low back disability, was filed on October 14, 2015. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

The AOJ, in an August 2016 rating decision, denied an increased rating in excess of 20 percent; and granted service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve, and assigned an initial rating of 20 percent, effective from October 14, 2015. The Veteran then filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) in August 2017 to initiate an appeal of a higher initial rating in excess of 20 percent, and an earlier effective date than October 14, 2015 for the award of service connection, for the service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve.

Under the legacy appeals system, appellate review is initiated by filing a timely Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in writing, and after a Statement of the Case (SOC) has been furnished, is completed by filing a timely substantive appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.200, 20.201, 20.202 (2018). A substantive appeal consists of a properly completed VA Form 9, "Appeal to Board of Veterans' Appeals," or correspondence containing the necessary information. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (2018). A substantive appeal must be filed within 60 days from the date when the AOJ mails the SOC to the claimant, or within the remainder of the one-year period from the date of mailing of the notification of the determination being appealed, whichever comes later. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (b)(1) (2018). However, following the AOJ's issuance of an August 2017 statement of the case (SOC) on the issue of an earlier effective date and a higher initial rating, the Veteran did not perfect a legacy appeal to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (2018). Further, the next relevant communication for this earlier effective date claim was not submitted until approximately November 2018, so more than a year later, as discussed below. 

Thus, the Board finds he did not continuously pursue a claim for an earlier effective date for either the award of a higher initial rating or for the award of service connection prior to October 14, 2015, for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve. Consequently, the evidence does not support reconsideration of the claim for an effective date earlier than October 14, 2015, for service connection for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy, with its initial 20 percent rating assignment. 

Even so, applying the general rule for effective dates, the Board finds the evidence would not have established a basis for an earlier effective date for the rating of 20 percent for the right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1). Here, the date of claim was on October 14, 2015, which is earlier than the date of entitlement in November 2015. Applying the date entitlement rose would provide a later, not an earlier, effective date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1). Moreover, the evidence did not establish a basis to find an earlier effective date was factually ascertainable between October 2014 and October 2015. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). Nonetheless, the Board will not disturb the AOJ's determination, so as to not prejudice to the Veteran. 

For the above reasons, the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than October 14, 2015, for a 20 percent initial rating for the Veteran's right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy is not warranted. The appeal is denied.

2. An earlier effective date of November 30, 2018, for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, femoral nerve.

3. An earlier effective date of November 30, 2018, for service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy, femoral nerve.

4. An earlier effective date of November 30, 2018, for service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve.

In this case, a December 2020 rating decision granted the Veteran's service-connection claims for left lower extremity radiculopathies of the sciatic and femoral nerves, respectively, with initial 20 percent rating assignments, effective from November 30, 2020, the date of a VA examination; and granted service-connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral nerve, also effective from November 30, 2020. The Veteran appeals for earlier effective dates for service connection for these disabilities prior to November 30, 2020. 

The Board initially considers the date of entitlement. The Veteran has been entitled to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy since at least July 2010, on review of his VA treatment records. As discussed above, he has also been entitled to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy since at least 2015.   

Concerning the date of claim, the Veteran filed an Intent to File a claim on November 30, 2018 and followed up with an December 2018 claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) that is relevant to his service-connection claims for the right lower extremity femoral nerve radiculopathy and left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral and sciatic nerves. So, his claims were filed as early as November 30, 2018. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. Next, the Board observes the Veteran continuously pursued the issue of earlier effective dates for service connection for these disabilities. See December 2021 supplemental claim; March 2022 rating decision (denying earlier effective date claim); March 2023 Higher Level Review (HLR) request; June 2023 HLR rating decision; May 2024 AMA NOD: appeal to Board. "Continuously pursued issues" include that following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c)(1). Thus, the date of claim was November 30, 2018. 

As noted, the Board also finds the evidence establishes entitlement to service connection for many years prior to November 2018. Applying the general rule of effective dates, the date of claim is later than the date of entitlement. 

After resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, an effective date of November 30, 2018, for service connection for the right lower extremity femoral nerve radiculopathy and left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral and sciatic nerves, is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the AMA, the Board shall remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

5. An earlier effective date of November 30, 2018, for the award of a TDIU.

6. An earlier effective date of November 30, 2018, for the award of DEA benefits.

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to November 30, 2018, for the awards of a TDIU and DEA benefits. 

By history, the AOJ awarded a TDIU from November 30, 2020, when the Veteran initially established entitlement on a schedular basis. As noted above, the Board is presently awarding an earlier effective date of November 30, 2018, for service connection for the right lower extremity femoral nerve radiculopathy and left lower extremity radiculopathy of the femoral and sciatic nerves. However, the assignment of the initial ratings are downstream issues for the AOJ to address in the first instance. That is, the AOJ has not yet effectuated the initial ratings for these disabilities for the period from November 30, 2018 to November 30, 2020, which will impact the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU and DEA benefits during the same period.

The Board finds the earlier effective date claims for a TDIU and DEA benefits are inextricably intertwined with the initial ratings yet to be assigned for service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies, granted herein. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (issues are inextricably intertwined and must be considered together when a decision concerning one could have a significant impact on the other). 

7. An increased rating in excess of 20 percent for a low back disability.

8. An increased rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve.

9. An increased rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy, femoral nerve.

10. An increased rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve.

11. An increased rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy, femoral nerve.

Remand is required to remedy pre-decisional duty to assist error for the increased rating claims for the lumbar spine disability and associated radiculopathies.

As relevant here, a December 2020 VA back conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) diagnosed degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, based upon a January 2018 MRI test, and a secondary condition of bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. The December 2020 VA examiner remarked the radiculopathy is a direct common complication of degenerative arthritis of the spine. The December 2020 VA examination of the back recorded the Veteran's complaints of flare-ups of severe back pain. In particular, the Veteran reported that during flare ups, he may stay in bed for a week due to excruciating pain, such that he cannot sit, walk, or sleep.

To highlight, the VA examiner found the Veteran does not have "ankylosis" of the spine. However, no rationale was provided for such finding, despite the Veteran's reports of severe flare-ups that require up to a week of bedrest. In Chavis v. McDonough, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) determined that in assessing musculoskeletal disabilities, the Board must address whether ankylosis can be met by symptoms representing the functional equivalent of ankylosis. See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (Apr. 16, 2021). 

Further, the VA examiner found that range of motion was decreased by only 5 degrees on forward flexion. For instance, the Veteran exhibited 70 degrees forward flexion and 20 degrees extension on active motion, compared to 65 degrees estimated forward flexion and 15 degrees extension on flare-ups. However, the examiner did not explain how flare-ups were estimated to result in such a slight loss of motion, given the Veteran's reports of "excruciating" flare-ups lasting up to a week and necessitating bed rest. In addition, the examiner did not address recent private treatment records that showed several instances where the Veteran had to receive epidural injections to treat his back pain and radiculopathy. See Veteran's May 2024 AMA NOD.

The December 2020 VA examiner found the overall severity of the right and left lower extremity radiculopathies to be "moderate" rather than "severe", albeit with no rationale provided for these critical findings, including any reconciliation of reported flare-ups. Importantly, there is no indication that any peripheral nerve testing was conducted to assess the severity of the service-connected bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies. Although the Veteran submitted medical literature on the electromyography (EMG) testing in assessing radiculopathy, it does not appear that the examiner conducted such testing.

Thus, the VA examination was inadequate. Inadequate medical examinations include examinations that contain only data and conclusions, do not provide an etiological opinion, are not based upon a review of medical records, or provide unsupported conclusions. Given the AOJ's pre-decisional duty to assist error, a remand is necessary to assess any limitation of motion due to flare-ups, including any functional equivalent of ankylosis, and to assess the severity of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination, with a different clinician than a previous VA examiner, to address the current severity of his service-connected lumbar spine disability and associated radiculopathies of the bilateral lower extremities. All necessary testing, including peripheral nerve testing, deemed to be necessary by the examiner, must be accomplished. On review of the record, the examiner shall provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disabilities under the rating criteria.

After reviewing the record, the examiner shall comment on the following: (a) whether the Veteran's lumbar spine disability's limited range of motion and associated functional impairment, particularly upon painful flare-ups, constitutes the functional equivalent of ankylosis; and (b) if so, whether the Veteran demonstrates the functional equivalent of unfavorable ankylosis of (i) the entire thoracolumbar spine, or (ii) the entire spine.

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions rendered. The Veteran's lay statements shall be considered as well as the pertinent evidence of record.

2. Then readjudicate the Veteran's remaining claims, including the inextricably intertwined effective date issues for TDIU and DEA basic eligibility.
