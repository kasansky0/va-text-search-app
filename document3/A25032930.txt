CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of August 10, 2022 for the grant of a 20 percent disability rating for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy (sciatic) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8520.

2. The criteria for an effective date of August 10, 2022 for the grant of a 20 percent disability rating for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy (sciatic) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active-duty military service from January 1971 to October 1972. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) has held that a claim for a TDIU is part of an increased rating claim when such claim is expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). The Board finds that the issue of TDIU has been raised by the Veteran and is, thus, properly before the Board

However, because the Board is remanding the inferred claim of entitlement to a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that the Veteran sought a higher-level review of the decision on appeal in March 2024 and that a decision was rendered in July 2024. The Board notes that there is no prohibition against electing multiple AMA review options so long as the elections are not concurrent. Thus, the issue on appeal is the February 2024 rating decision specifically appealed in the July 2024 VA Form 10182. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 25-26 (2023).

1-2. Entitlement to a 20 percent rating for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy (sciatic) is granted effective August 10, 2022.

The Veteran is asserting that the evidence shows entitlement to a 20 percent rating for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy from August 10, 2022. See October 2023 VA Form 20-0995 and March 2024 VA Form 21-4138.

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

The Veteran is not seeking an increased rating for his currently assigned 20 percent rating for bilateral peripheral neuropathy. See July 2024 VA Form 10182. Specifically, the Veteran contends that the currently assigned 20 percent rating should be granted for the entirety of the appeal period, which is from August 10, 2022, as he has continuously pursued the appeal.

By way of history, in a September 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for left and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy (sciatic) and was assigned a 10 percent rating for each lower extremity effective August 10, 2022. In an October 2023 supplemental claim, the Veteran appealed the September 2023 rating decision which assigned a 10 percent rating and specifically requested a 20 percent rating. A February 2024 rating decision increased the disability rating for both lower extremities to 20 percent, effective January 19, 2024, the date of the VA examination. In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran specifically appealed the effective date. The Veteran presented argument in March 2024 clarifying that he was only disagreeing with the assignment of the effective date of the 20 percent rating. See March 2024 lay statement.      

Regarding impairment of motor functions, a July 2023 VA examination shows tingling, slight numbness, and unsteadiness due to decreased "feeling". A January 2024 VA examination report showed that the Veteran reported unsteadiness due to decreased sensation. 

Regarding trophic changes, the July 2023 VA examination report shows no trophic changes. The January 2024 VA examination report shows trophic changes to include decreased hair bilaterally with shiny skin to feet and ankles and dry flaky skin.

Regarding sensory disturbance, the July 2023 VA examination report revealed decreased light touch sensation at the foot/toes, decreased position sense, absent vibration sensation, and decreased cold sensation. The January 2024 VA examination report showed decreased sensation at the lower leg/ankle bilaterally and absent sensation at the foot/toes bilaterally. 

Regarding loss of reflexes, the July 2023 VA examination report revealed normal reflexes. The January 2024 VA examination report showed hypoactive reflexes at the bilateral ankles. 

The July 2023 VA examination report revealed moderate intermittent pain bilaterally, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias bilaterally, and moderate numbness bilaterally. The January 2024 VA examination report showed moderate constant pain bilaterally, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias bilaterally, and severe numbness bilaterally.

Neither the July 2023 VA examination report nor the January 2024 VA examination report revealed muscle atrophy or complete paralysis. 

A September 2023 letter from a private physician, received by VA in October 2023, indicated that the Veteran had moderate severity bilaterally with paresthesias and difficulty with balance. 

The Board notes that the January 2024 examination report indicates that the Veteran has moderate incomplete paralysis of the common peroneal nerve which is part of the sciatic nerve branch for which the Veteran is already service connected. There are five separate nerve branches in the lower extremities that may be separately rated: sciatic, femoral, obturator, external cutaneous nerve of the thigh, and ilio-inguinal nerve. Assigning separate ratings from within these nerve branches is not warranted as it would constitute impermissible pyramiding.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity neuropathy is manifest by moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, bilaterally from the date of claim. Specifically, the Board notes that the January 2023 VA examination report shows moderate subjective complaints to include objective testing that revealed decreased light touch sensation at the foot/toes, decreased position sense, absent vibration sensation, and decreased cold sensation. The January 2024 VA examination report shows some trophic changes, decreased sensation, hypoactive reflexes at the bilateral ankles, pain, and numbness with unsteadiness. The evidence does not show muscle atrophy. As such, the Board finds that the evidence supports the Veteran's express contention that a 20 percent rating is warranted for moderate bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy from August 10, 2022, the entire period on appeal. The express benefit sought is granted. 

In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence is persuasively in favor of the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not in approximate balance, the doctrine is not for application. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

3. Entitlement to a Total Disability Rating Based on Individual Unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

When a Veteran files a claim for an increased disability rating, he or she is presumed to be seeking the maximum benefit under any applicable theory, including a TDIU. Rice v Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. at 453-54.

A TDIU is when a total disability rating is assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities: provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and that, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. Therefore, rating boards should submit to the Director, Compensation Service, for extra-schedular consideration all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the percentage standards. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

The January 2024 VA examination report indicated, "Veteran has constant bilateral foot pain, numbness, and tingling causing unsteadiness on his feet. He has to use a cane at times to help with balance. He would have difficulty with working." 

Unlike in the legacy system, the reasons for remand by the Board in the modernized review system are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors); and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). 

As such, the Board finds that the evidence raises the issue of TDIU. A remand for further development is warranted.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Seek any information that is not already of record deemed necessary to develop this inferred TDIU claim for the period on appeal and provide the Veteran a reasonable amount of time to respond.

2. Adjudicate the issue of entitlement to TDIU for the period on appeal.
