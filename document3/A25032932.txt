ORDER

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the Veteran's mental treatment by a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility on July 7, 2020, (Claim ID: 302103300037027000) is dismissed.

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the Veteran's mental treatment by a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility on July 7, 2020, (Claim ID: 302103300037794000) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While the appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively reversed its initial finding that the appellant's claim for payment or reimbursement for two episodes of the Veteran's non-VA treatment July 2020 and notified the appellant that the claim would be reprocessed.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a non-VA treatment provider who sought reimbursement or payment for two episodes of non-VA medical care of the Veteran.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from February 2021 decisions. The Appellant filed a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal in February 2021.

A February 2022 letter informed the appellant that, upon secondary review, the appellant's appeal for the denial due to timeliness had been approved.  That letter informed the Appellant that the claim for the care rendered on July 7, 2020, would be reprocessed.

The administrative action approving the reprocessing of the payment for the treatment in question constitutes a complete grant of the benefits sought. As a result, no determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees, and the appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(b).
