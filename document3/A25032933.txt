ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction is denied.

Service connection for hyperlipidemia is denied.

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) secondary to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

Whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted, sufficient to readjudicate the claim for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is denied. 

REMANDED

Service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's erectile dysfunction manifested in difficulty attaining and maintaining an erection. 

2. Hyperlipidemia is a laboratory finding and not a disability under VA law and regulations.

3. The weight of the competent evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's OSA is related to his service-connected PTSD. 

4. New and relevant evidence has not been received since the March 2023 denial of the claim for service connection for BPH. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code (Code) 7522 (2024). 

2. The criteria for service connection for hyperlipidemia have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5103A, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 4.1 (2024). 

3. The criteria for service connection for OSA secondary to PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1141, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303, 3.310 (2024). 

4. New and relevant evidence has not been received, and readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for BPH is not required. 38 U.S.C. § 5108 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d) (2024). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1968 to December 1969.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) on appeal from rating decisions dated June 2024, August 2024, and December 2024 of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024, August 2024, and December 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for a right knee disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

In a March 2025 docketing letter, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) provided notice to the Veteran that the additional evidence he submitted could not be considered unless he switched AMA dockets (to Evidence Submission or Hearing).  See generally Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). No docket switch request has been received to date. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed relating to service connection for BPH. As the Board is deciding this claim, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed relating to service connection for a right knee disability. As the Board is remanding this claim for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of the claim.

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity caused by the given disability. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular Code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining, including degree of disability, is to be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the claim is to be denied. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

In any claim for an increased rating, "staged" ratings may be warranted where the factual findings show distinct time periods when the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

The Veteran's erectile dysfunction is rated pursuant to Code 7522, which is for erectile dysfunction. Pursuant to that Code, a noncompensable rating is warranted for erectile dysfunction, with or without penile dysfunction. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.  This is the maximum rating allowed.  The rating criteria does not provide for a compensable rating.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has difficulty attaining and maintaining an erection. See, e.g., August 2024 VA examination. However, a compensable rating simply may not be assigned pursuant to Code 7522.  Moreover, while special monthly compensation may be assigned on the basis of the loss of use of a creative organ, the Veteran is already in receipt of the same. Thus, a compensable rating must be denied.

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection requires evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Secondary service connection may be granted for disability that is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). The evidence must show that a current disability exists and that the current disability was either caused by or aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Where lay evidence is competent, the Board must weigh the competent lay evidence against the other evidence of record in determining credibility. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1334-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006). However, the absence of corroborating records is an insufficient basis on which to find lay statements not credible. Id. at 1337.

2. Service connection for hyperlipidemia

In the August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the following findings: (1) The claimed primary disability of hypertension is service-connected; and (2) the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity of exposure to various chemicals, to include agent orange and asbestos, is conceded based on his military duties while in the service. Under the Appeals Modernization Act, the Board is bound by the favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. The Board finds no clear and unmistakable error in this instance.

The Board finds that service connection is not warranted on either a direct or secondary basis, as hyperlipidemia is not in itself a disability for VA purposes.

The Board acknowledges that private treatment records show treatment for hyperlipidemia. See July 2022 Private Treatment Record. However, hyperlipidemia is a laboratory result and not an actual disability for which VA compensation benefits are payable. See 61 Fed. Reg. 20,440, 20,445 (May 7, 1996) (Diagnoses of hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, and elevated cholesterol are laboratory results and are not, in and of themselves, disabilities. They are, therefore, not appropriate entities for the rating schedule). The term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see also Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 296 (1991); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995). A symptom, without a diagnosed or identifiable underlying malady or condition or associated functional impairment, does not, in and of itself, constitute a "disability" for which service connection may be granted. See Sanchez-Benitez v. West, 13 Vet. App. 282 (1999).

In this case, while hyperlipidemia may be a risk factor for disability, it is not itself a disability for VA purposes. Accordingly, there is no basis for awarding service connection for hyperlipidemia, and the appeal in this regard is denied.

3. Service connection for sleep apnea, including as secondary to PTSD

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for his OSA, to include as secondary to his service-connected PTSD. For the reasons outlined below, the Board finds that the weight of the competent evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's OSA is related to his PTSD and secondary service connection is therefore warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

In the August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the following findings: (1) the Veteran's participation in a toxic risk activity resulting in exposure to a herbicide during service in Vietnam is conceded; (2) the Veteran has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea shown by treatment records dated May 28, 2020; (3) the Veteran has sufficient service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection. Under the Appeals Modernization Act, the Board is bound by the favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. The Board finds no clear and unmistakable error in this instance.

The Veteran's private physician stated in an April 2020 report that the diagnosed OSA may be linked to his PTSD and depression. Additionally, the February 2021 VA psychiatric examination includes symptoms of sleep disturbance and chronic sleep impairment that are associated with his PTSD.

A November 2021 VA etiology opinion opined that the Veteran's OSA was less likely than not related to his service connected PTSD. The examiner stated, "[t]he [V]eteran has well documented service connection for PTSD and concomitant OSA. His records claim OSA as a condition, possibly contributory, to his OSA. In medical literature specifically referring to veterans from the Vietnam war, there was 69 [percent] who also had PTSD. However, the OSA is more a function of correlation as opposed to causation. Historically, PTSD does have a causative nature toward the development of Sleep Apnea in the medical literature, however, ultimately in the face of the other factors, for this Veteran there is insufficient evidence to support a causative relationship, therefore the OSA and PTSD diagnoses are likely correlative." 

Given the November 2021 VA examiner's findings that PTSD does have a causative nature toward the development of sleep apnea in the medical literature and that OSA and PTSD are likely correlative, in addition to the April 2020 private physician's note and the February 2021 PTSD VA examination, the Board cannot conclusively disassociate the current OSA disability from the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance or nearly equal that the Veteran's OSA is related to his service-connected PTSD. Secondary service connection is therefore warranted. 

4. Whether new and relevant evidence has been submitted, sufficient to readjudicate the claim for BPH

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for BPH most recently addressed in a March 2023 rating decision. In June 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received. Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

The Board concludes that new and relevant evidence sufficient to readjudicate the claim has not been submitted.

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156 (d), 3.2501(a)(1). New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1). "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue. Id. 

The Veteran's initial claim for service connection for BPH was denied in a March 2023 rating decision. Evidence added to the record since the March 2023 denial includes new VA and private treatment records and a VA examination that are not relevant as they do not contain treatment for or examination of PBH. The evidence added since the September 2023 denial also includes duplicative copies of the Veteran service personnel records previously of record at the time of the March 2023 decision. There has been no new evidence regarding the Veteran's claimed BPH added to the record since March 2023. Accordingly, readjudication is not warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

The Veteran was afforded a July 2020 VA examination for his diagnosed right knee disability. The examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness as there is no evidence in the STR's to support a knee condition. However, the examiner failed to consider the Veteran's reported medical history during the examination of having injured his knee in 1968 during service when he twisted his right knee after slipping. The examiner also did not consider lay statements submitted in April 2020, prior to the examination, that includes a statement from a buddy who served with the Veteran on the USS Hanson and observed that he injured his right knee in service. 

In order to properly adjudicate this appeal, a fully articulated and soundly reasoned medical opinion that accounts for competent lay statements is needed. As such, another VA examination must be afforded to the Veteran. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 125 (2007); Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ should arrange for a VA examination with an appropriate examiner to determine the nature and likely cause of any disability of the right knee. The examiner should review the claim file (including this remand) and note such review was conducted. Based on review of the record and examination of the Veteran, the examiner should provide an opinion with detailed rationale that responds to the following:

(a.) Please identify, by diagnosis, all disabilities of the right knee present during the appeal period (from April 2024), including osteoarthritis and degenerative arthritis. See July 2020 VA Examination.

(b.) For each disability of the right knee diagnosed, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such disability was either incurred in or otherwise related to the Veteran's military service? Please explain why.

The examiner must specifically consider the Veteran's description of his in-service injury and symptoms as well as his post-service symptoms. The examiner must also consider the buddy statements submitted in April 2020.

?

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions expressed. When providing the requested opinions, the examiner is asked to state whether the evidence is in approximate balance or nearly equal in the Veteran's favor. If the examiner cannot provide a requested opinion without resorting to speculation, it must be so stated, and the examiner must provide the reasons why that opinion would require speculation. The examiner must indicate whether there was any further need for information or testing necessary to make a determination. Additionally, the examiner must indicate whether any opinion could not be rendered due to limitations of knowledge in the medical community at large and not those of the particular examiner.
