ORDER

Eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees to the appellant from past due benefits awarded in an October 2023 rating decision granting entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED) and assigning Special Monthly Compensation for loss of use of a creation organ (hereinafter SMC(k)) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In August 2022, the Veteran submitted an original claim of entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer as well as service connection for ED as secondary to bladder cancer; the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a November 2022 rating decision denying both claims.

2. In May 2023 VA received a valid VA Form 21-22a appointing the appellant as the Veteran's representative, as well as a duly signed fee agreement stipulating the direct payment of 20 percent of past due benefits awarded; on behalf of the Veteran the appellant concurrently submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Higher Level Review (HLR) Request identifying the November 2022 rating decision and specifically the issues of service connection for bladder cancer and ED.

3. The AOJ issued a September 2023 HLR decision denying service connection for bladder cancer but identified a duty to assist error in the previous rating decision's adjudication of the Veteran's ED claim; after further development the AOJ issued an October 2023 rating decision granting entitlement to service connection for ED as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) from August 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees to the appellant from past due benefits awarded in an October 2023 rating decision granting entitlement to service connection for ED and SMC(k) have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from April 1968 to November 1970; the appellant is his representative in other matters before VA.  This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an October 2023 VA Fee Decision issued by the AOJ regarding an October 2023 rating decision granting service connection for ED and SMC(k).  As this was an initial fee determination, the contested claims procedures of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) apply.

Pursuant to these procedures, a redacted copy of the appellant's substantive appeal was sent to the Veteran's address on file.  Letters were also sent to each contested claimant in December 2023 and February 2024, respectively informing them of their appellate rights and the docketing of the appeal at the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400-20.404.  As the appellant elected the Direct Review docket in his timely December 2023 VA Form 10182 Board Appeal and the Veteran has not requested a different docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 Fee Decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. Eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees from past due benefits awarded in an October 2023 rating decision granting service connection for ED and assigning SMC(k)

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.  A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization [VSO] as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative," is required to represent a claimant before VA and to authorize VA's disclosure of information to any person or organization representing a claimant before the Department.  Without the signature of a person providing representation for a particular claim under § 14.630 of this part or an accredited VSO representative, agent, or attorney, the appointment is invalid, and the person appointed to provide representation is under no obligation to do so.  

The power of attorney shall meet the following requirements: (1) Contain signature by: (i) The claimant, or (ii) The claimant's guardian, or (iii) In the case of an incompetent, minor, or otherwise incapacitated person without a guardian, the following in the order named - spouse, parent, other relative or friend (if interests are not adverse), or the director of the hospital in which the claimant is maintained; and (iv) An individual providing representation on a particular claim under § 14.630 of this part or an accredited VSO representative, agent, or attorney; and (2) Shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past due benefits.  A direct-pay fee agreement is a fee agreement between the claimant or appellant and an agent or attorney providing for payment of fees out of past due benefits awarded directly to an agent or attorney.  A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to pay the agent or attorney out of past due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA.  A copy of a direct pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).

An initial claim is any complete claim, other than a supplemental claim, for a benefit on a form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  The first initial claim for one or more benefits received by VA is further defined as an original claim.  (See original claim, § 3.160(b)).  Id.  Initial claims include: (i) A new claim requesting service connection for a disability or grant of a new benefit, and (ii) A claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating or rate of a benefit paid based on a change or worsening in condition or circumstance since the last decision issued by VA for the benefit.  Id. 

The AMA applies to all claims originally decided after February 19, 2019.  See Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017).  Under the AMA, a claimant has three administrative review options for an adverse decision which must be filed within one year from notice of a decision - 1) a request for Higher Level Review, 2) an appeal to the Board, or 3) the filing of a supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Timely filing an appropriate administrative review option under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 may preserve an effective date from a claim which is continuously pursued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  The AMA also broadly recognizes three types of claims: a supplemental claim, an initial claim, and a claim for increase.  84 Fed. Reg. 138, 139 (Jan 18, 2019).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

By way of history, the Veteran's PTSD and CAD have been service connected from January 2016 and December 2019, respectively.  In August 2022, he submitted a VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim seeking service connection for bladder cancer and ED as secondary to his bladder cancer.  The AOJ denied both claims in a November 2022 rating decision.  After being appointed as representative, the appellant submitted a May 2023 VA Form 20-0996 HLR Request identifying the November 2022 rating decision and listing the issues of service connection for bladder cancer and ED as secondary to bladder cancer.  In September 2023, the AOJ issued a HLR decision that continued to deny the claim of entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer but also found a duty to assist error in the prior adjudication of the Veteran's ED claim.  

After further development, to include obtaining an additional medical opinion, the AOJ issued an October 2023 rating decision granting entitlement to service connection for ED as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected PTSD and CAD from the date of receipt of his August 2022 claim.  Based on this grant, the decision also assigned SMC(k) for loss of use of a creation organ per 38 U.S.C. 1114(k) from the same date.  According to internal VA records, this resulted in the award of $1,769.81 in past due benefits to the Veteran.  Finally, the October 2023 Fee Decision on appeal denied the appellant direct payment of fees because "VA never received a qualifying request to review this decision."  The appellant subsequently filed a timely VA Form 10182 Board Appeal.

At the outset, the Board finds that in May 2023 the appellant submitted a valid VA Form 21-22a appointing him as the Veteran's representative before VA, as well as a duly signed fee agreement stipulating the direct payment of 20 percent of past due benefits awarded.  The Board further finds that the appellant is eligible for the direct payment of fees from the past due benefits awarded in the October 2023 decision granting service connection for ED and assigning SMC(k).  Notably, agents and attorneys may charge fees for services provided after the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case.  Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. at 28. (2023).  A case, for fees purposes, encompasses all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations.  See, e.g., Perciavalle v. McDonough, 74 F.4th 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2023).  

In this case, the Board concludes that the appellant was permitted to charge fees for services provided after the initial November 2022 rating decision denying service connection for both bladder cancer and ED.  This was the initial decision with respect to the Veteran's August 2022 claim; which was an original claim because VA had not previously adjudicated the issue of service connection for ED.  After the initial decision denying service connection, the appellant filed an HLR request on behalf of the Veteran, and after the resulting September 2023 HLR decision identified a duty to assist error the AOJ obtained additional medical evidence before ultimately issuing the October 2023 rating decision granting service connection.  This decision granted the same or similar benefit- service connection for ED, that had been previously denied by VA in the November 2022 decision.  

Although it is debatable whether the October 2023 ED grant was on the same or similar basis as the previous November 2022 denial- as secondary to PTSD and CAD versus secondary to bladder cancer, this issue is not relevant to the present determination.  Here, the theory of entitlement that ultimately served as the basis for the grant of the Veteran's claim of service connection for ED was recognized by the AOJ as reasonably raised by the record during the pendency of the appeal.  As noted above, for fees purposes a "case" encompasses all potential claims raised by the evidence.  See Perciavalle, 74 F.4th at 1381.  Therefore, the October 2023 grant of service connection for ED was part of the same case as the November 2022 rating decision denying the same.  Similarly, the grant of SMC(k) for loss of use of a creative organ is part and parcel of compensating the Veteran for symptoms of ED.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522.  Therefore, the appellant is eligible for direct payment of fees from these awards, and the appeal is granted.
