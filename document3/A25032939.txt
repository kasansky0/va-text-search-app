REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1993 to March 2014.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date of June 4, 2023, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for IBS is granted.

The effective date for the grant of service connection based upon an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase is either the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise it will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).

Additionally, VA may grant entitlement to benefits from an effective date prior to the date the claim was received as long as a complete claim is received within one year of receipt of an Intent to File. When the complete claim is received within one year of the Intent to File, the effective date rules may be applied based on the intent to file. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

The Veteran filed an Intent to File a claim for compensation on June 4, 2023. The second paragraph of the document informed the Veteran that if his completed application was received within on year, and VA decides that he is entitled to benefits, VA may be able to provide compensation based upon the filing date of the Intent to File.

On October 12, 2023, the Veteran filed a complete claim for several issues, including a claim for IBS. In the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted service connection for IBS with an effective date of October 12, 2023, the date of the Veteran's claim for service connection.

However, the Board again notes that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 indicates that when a complete claim is received within one year of the Intent to File, effective date rules may be applied based upon the date of its filing. The Board finds that the October 12, 2023 claim was "complete," as it formed the basis for the January 2024 rating decision on appeal. Further, it was filed within one year of the June 4, 2023 Intent to File. Therefore, the Board finds that the June 4, 2023 Intent to File "a claim for increase" as contemplated by 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).

Accordingly, an earlier effective date for service connection for IBS of June 4, 2023, but no earlier, is granted. However, there is no basis upon which an effective date prior to June 4, 2023 may be granted.

Earlier Effective Date for the Assignment of Increased Disability Ratings

The assignment of effective dates is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increased compensation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

As outlined in the previous section, the Veteran filed an Intent to File on June 4, 2023. In the October 12, 2023 claim, the Veteran also requested increased ratings for his acquired psychiatric and asthma disabilities. Therefore, the Board finds that as the October 2023 claim was filed within one year of the June 2023 Intent to File, a June 4, 2023 effective date is available for both his acquired psychiatric and asthma increased rating claims, as the Intent to File is considered "the date of receipt of application." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

However, the Board must now address whether the "facts found" warrant an earlier effective date for increased ratings, dating back to June 4, 2023, based on the substantive medical evidence of record.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of June 4, 2023, but no earlier, for the assignment of a 70 percent disability rating for an acquired psychiatric disability is granted.

The Board notes that in the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted an increased disability rating of 70 percent for the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric disability with an effective date of October 12, 2023, the date of his claim. However, as noted above, an earlier effective date of June 4, 2023 is available if the evidence of record supports such a finding. 

Mental disorders are rated pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula). See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. Under the General Formula, a 70 percent evaluation is warranted for occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

The Board notes that there is approximately a four-month difference between the available earlier effective date and the currently assigned effective date. The AOJ granted the increased 70 percent disability rating based on a December 2023 VA mental disorders examination. The examiner noted the following symptoms attributable to the Veteran's diagnosis: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of short- and long-term memory, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting, and suicidal ideation. See December 2023 C&P Examination, p. 7. The Board notes that prior to this examination, the Veteran was not afforded a VA psychiatric examination since April 2014.

In addition, the Board notes that in June 2023, the Veteran sent an electronic message to his VA psychiatrist stating that he was experiencing sleep paralysis and that he was "hearing noises that weren't there . . . and feeling like others were in the room." See October 2023 CAPRI, p. 23. In another June 2023 electronic message, the Veteran reported that he was experiencing hallucinations. Id. at 24.

The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran had been experiencing ongoing and, at times, severe symptoms of his service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder. Such symptomatology was present prior to his currently assigned effective date of October 12, 2023 for the increased 70 percent disability rating. Additionally, the Board notes that there was no indication in the December 2023 VA examination suggesting that the Veteran's increased psychiatric symptomatology had a sudden or recent onset. This is further bolstered by the fact that the Veteran had not undergone a VA mental disorders examination since April 2014, over nine years prior.

Due to the above, the Board therefore finds that the facts and medical evidence of record indicate that the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder was at a level of severity constituting occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas dating back to June 4, 2023. Accordingly, the claim for an effective date of June 4, 2023, but no earlier, for the assignment of an increased 70 percent disability rating is granted. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date of June 4, 2023, but no earlier, for the assignment of a 30 percent disability rating for asthma disability is granted.

The Board notes that in the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted an increased disability rating of 30 percent under DC 6602 for the Veteran's service-connected asthma disability with an effective date of October 12, 2023, the date of his claim. However, as noted above, an earlier effective date of June 4, 2023 is available if the evidence of record supports such a finding. 

Under DC 6602, a 30 percent rating is warranted when a PFT shows a FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, or a FEV- 1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or when daily inhalation or oral bronchodilator therapy, or inhalation anti-inflammatory medication is required. The Board notes that the AOJ specifically granted an increased 30 percent disability rating for asthma based on the Veteran's use of daily inhalational therapy. See January 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative, p. 6; see also December 2023 C&P Examination, p. 3. The Board also notes that prior to this examination, the Veteran was not afforded a VA respiratory conditions examination since April 2014. See April 2014 C&P Examination, p. 72.

Turning to the Veteran's VA treatment records, his active medication list includes a prescription for albuterol as needed for shortness of breath. See January 2024 CAPRI, p. 5. The prescriber directed the Veteran to inhale two puffs by mouth every four hours as needed. Id. The prescription was from March 2023 and expired in December 2023. Id.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively indicates that the Veteran required the use of daily inhalation therapy to treat his service-connected asthma disability, dating back to at least March 2023. Therefore, as a June 4, 2023 effective date is available, the Board finds that such date is the appropriate effective date for the assignment of the increased 30 percent rating for the disability. There is no evidence indicating that an effective date prior to June 4, 2023 is warranted.
