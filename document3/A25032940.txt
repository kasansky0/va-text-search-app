FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an April 2023 rating decision, the RO reduced the ratings for the appellant's service-connected right and left hip strains with limitation of extension from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective January 3, 2023.

2. The 10 percent disability ratings for service-connected right and left hip strains with limitation of extension had been in effect since May 30, 2017, a period of more than five years.

3. The RO's action in reducing the ratings for service-connected right and left hip strains with limitation of extension from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective January 3, 2023, did not result in a reduction of compensation payments.

4. The evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 rating decision did not clearly reflect a material improvement in the appellant's service-connected right or left hip strain with limitation of extension.

5. Throughout the period under review, right hip flexion was not limited to 30 degrees or worse.

6. Throughout the period under review, left hip flexion was not limited to 30 degrees or worse.

7. The appellant is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for right hip limitation of extension for the entire period under review.

8. The appellant is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for left hip limitation of extension for the entire period under review.

9. Throughout the period under review, there has not been right thigh limitation of abduction, adduction, and rotation, such that the appellant cannot toe-out more than 15 degrees, limitation of adduction such that she cannot cross legs, or limitation of abduction with motion lost beyond 10 degrees.

10. Throughout the period under review, there has not been left thigh limitation of abduction, adduction, and rotation, such that the appellant cannot toe-out more than 15 degrees, limitation of adduction such that she cannot cross legs, or limitation of abduction with motion lost beyond 10 degrees.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The reduction of the rating for right hip strain with limitation of extension from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective January 3, 2023, was improper.  Restoration of the 10 percent disability rating for right hip strain with limitation of extension, effective January 3, 2023, is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344, 4.71a, DCs 5251.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant served on active duty in the United States Army from August 2011 to February 2015.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which, in pertinent part, increased the ratings for right and left hip strains with limitation of flexion to 10 percent, decreased the ratings for right and left hip strains with limitation of extension to 0 percent, and awarded service connection for right and left hip strains with impairment of abduction, adduction, and rotation and assigned initial noncompensable ratings, all effective January 3, 2023.  The AOJ issued the rating decision to the appellant with a notification letter on April 19, 2023.

On April 2, 2024, VA received the appellant's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), upon which she identified the April 2023 rating decision, the issues as the ratings for left and right hip strain, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that on the April 2024 VA Form 10182, the appellant also identified a July 2017 rating decision denying compensable ratings for right and left hip disabilities, a July 2018 rating decision denying service connection for right knee, right foot, and left foot disabilities, and a May 2022 rating decision denying service connection for tinnitus.  Because the April 20204 VA Form 10182 was received more than one year after notification of the July 2017, June 2018, and May 2022 rating decisions, and absent any request for an extension of the period for filing a Notice of Disagreement or indicia of good cause, the Board finds that these issues are not on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203; Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021); Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024).

Rating Reductions

1. Propriety of the reduction of the rating for right hip strain with limitation of extension (DC 5251), from 10 to zero percent effective January 3, 2023.

2. Propriety of the reduction of the rating for left hip strain with limitation of extension (DC 5251), from 10 to zero percent effective January 3, 2023.

Prior to the April 2023 rating decision, the appellant had been in receipt of 10 percent ratings for right and left hip strains with limitation of extension under DC 5251, since May 30, 2017.  In the April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ reduced these ratings under DC 5251 to 0 percent, effective January 3, 2023, and awarded 10 percent ratings for right and left hip strains with limitation of flexion under DC 5252, all effective January 3, 2023.

The AOJ determined that the appellant met the criteria for compensable ratings for limitation of flexion under DC 5252 based on 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 and did not meet the criteria for compensable ratings for limitation of extension under DC 5251.  The effect of the April 2023 rating decision was essentially a change in diagnostic codes to more accurately reflect the appellant's symptoms.  The appellant remained in receipt of one 10 percent rating each for her right and left hip disabilities.  Prior to January 3, 2023, the 10 percent ratings were under DC 5251.  Since January 3, 2023, the 10 percent ratings were under DC 5252.

The assignment of a particular diagnostic code is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case."  Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993).  One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the current diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology.  See Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625, 629 (1992).  It is permissible to switch diagnostic codes (for instance from DC 5251 to DC 5252) to more accurately reflect a claimant's symptoms.  See Read v. Shinseki, 651 F.3d 1296, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Murray v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 420, 425 (2011).  Service connection for a disability is not severed when the diagnostic code associated with it is changed to determine more accurately the benefit to which a veteran may be entitled.  Read, 651 F.3d at 1302.  

The Board observes that the AOJ previously changed the diagnostic codes for the appellant's 10 percent right and left hip disability ratings to more accurately reflect her symptoms.  

When the AOJ awarded service connection for right and left hip strains in an October 2016 rating decision, it assigned initial 10 percent ratings under DC 5252 for limitation of flexion.  In July 2017, the AOJ continued the 10 percent ratings, but such were now rated under DC 5251 for limitation of extension.  The AOJ characterized such as continuing the 10 percent ratings in the July 2017 rating decision.

As range of motion was not limited to a compensable degree for extension under DC 5251 or flexion under DC 5252, it is unclear to the Board why the AOJ changed the diagnostic codes at all.  Rather, the appellant was awarded 10 percent ratings for painful motion per 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, regardless of which diagnostic code was assigned for each hip.

Although the result of the April 2023 rating decision was a change of diagnostic codes which did not ultimately result in a reduction of the disability rating for either hip, the AOJ characterized its actions as rating reductions and cited the law and regulations for reductions.  See e.g. Owen v. McDonough, No. 22-6653, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 559, at *9 (Apr. 17, 2024) (mem dec) (Greenberg, J.) ("Just because the appellant's overall disability rating did not change, it does not follow that the award of a disability rating for a new symptom merely represents 'a change in diagnostic code for rating purposes'. . . The Board therefore erred in treating the appellant's claim on appeal as one for an increased disability rating."); See also Bethea v. Derwinski,?2?Vet. App.?252, 254?(1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).? The Board will thus analyze whether the AOJ's rating reductions were proper.

Here, the Board finds that the reduction in ratings for right and left hip strains with limitation of extension from 10 percent disabling to 0 percent, effective January 3, 2023, was not proper.

As noted supra, an April 2023 rating decision decreased the evaluations for right and left hip strains with limitation of extension from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective January 3, 2023.  This did not result in a reduction of compensation payments.  These ratings were essentially replaced by 10 percent ratings for right and left hip strains with limitation of flexion, effective January 3, 2023.  In fact, the appellant's combined evaluation for compensation increased from 60 percent to 70 percent, effective January 3, 2023, as the April 2023 rating decision also increased the ratings for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy from 10 percent to 20 percent, effective January 3, 2023.  Thus, the procedural safeguards for rating reductions outlined in section 3.105(e) are not for application.  VAOPGCPREC 71-91 (Nov. 7, 1991); see also Stelzel v. Mansfield, 508 F.3d 1345, 1347-49 (Fed. Cir. 2007); O'Connell v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 89, 92 (Vet. App. 2007). It is not contended otherwise.

The 10 percent disability ratings for service-connected right and left hip strains with limitation of extension had been in effect since May 30, 2017, a period of more than five years but less than 20 years.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c), when a disability rating has been in effect for less than five years, reexaminations disclosing improvement will warrant a rating reduction.

Rating agencies will handle cases affected by change of medical findings or diagnosis so as to produce the greatest degree of stability of disability evaluations consistent with the laws and VA regulations governing disability compensation and pension.  It is essential that the entire record of examination and the medical-industrial history be reviewed to ascertain whether the recent examination is full and complete, including all special examinations indicated as a result of general examination and the entire case history.  Examinations which are less thorough than those on which payments were originally based will not be used as a basis for reduction.

Ratings for diseases subject to temporary or episodic improvement, such as epilepsy, asthma, ulcers, and many skin diseases, will not be reduced on the basis of any one examination, except in those instances where all of the evidence of record clearly warrants the conclusion that sustained improvement has been demonstrated.  Moreover, where material improvement in the physical or mental condition is clearly reflected, the rating agency will consider whether the evidence makes it reasonably certain that the improvement will be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.  38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a).  The above considerations are required for ratings which have continued for long periods at the same level, i.e. five years or more.  38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).

Once the five-year requirement of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 has been satisfied, a reduction of the pertinent rating percentages can only be effected if the reduction complies with the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a).  The reduction can be justified only if there is a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the rating reduction is warranted.  Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993).

Specifically, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims requires that adjudicators must: 1) review the entire record of examinations and medical and industrial history to ascertain whether the recent examination(s) on which the reduction was based were full and complete; 2) decline to use examinations which are less full and complete than those on which payments were authorized or continued; 3) not reduce an evaluation except in cases where all the evidence clearly warrants a finding of material improvement.  In addition, where material improvement in the physical condition is clearly shown, the rating agency must consider whether the evidence makes it reasonably certain that the improvement will be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.  Brown, at 419-20.

Prior to reducing a veteran's disability rating, however, VA is required to "comply with several general VA regulations applicable to all rating-reduction cases, regardless of the rating level or the length of time that the rating has been in effect."  Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 349 (2000), citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.  These general provisions "impose a clear requirement that VA rating reductions, as with all VA rating decisions, be based upon review of the entire history of the veteran's disability."  Id., citing Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).

The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that such review requires VA

to ascertain, based upon review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based upon thorough examinations. . . . Thus, in any rating-reduction case not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred but also that that improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 42; see also Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 594 ("[t]hese requirements for evaluation of the complete medical history of the claimant's condition operate to protect claimants against adverse decisions based on a single, incomplete[,] or inaccurate report and to enable VA to make a more precise evaluation of the level of disability and of any changes in the condition").  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).

In considering the propriety of a reduction, the Board must focus on the evidence available to the RO at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of evaluating whether the conditions had demonstrated actual improvement.  Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277 (1992).

Here, the Board finds that the reduction was improper because the AOJ did not consider whether the evidence made it reasonably certain that the improvement would be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.  38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a).  Rather, in the April 2023 rating decision at issue, the RO appears to have determined that reductions were warranted solely based on range of motion testing results obtained at the January 2023 examination.

In the April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ reduced the 10 percent ratings for right and left hip strains with limitation of extension under DC 5251 because the limitation of extension was not limited enough to merit a compensable rating under DC 5251 for either hip, as right hip extension was to 25 degrees and left hip extension was to 25 degrees per the January 2023 contracted examination report.

The Board notes that the hip and thigh conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) states that the normal extension endpoint is 30 degrees.  Range of motion diagrams are included in 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Hip flexion and abduction are visualized in Plate II.  Hip flexion goes from 0 degrees (fully straightened) to 125 degrees (fully flexed).  Hip extension is not explicitly pictured or otherwise defined in the regulations.  While the hip flexion visual suggests that full extension of the hip would be to 0 degrees, the hip and thigh conditions DBQ suggests that full hip extension is more than 0 degrees, in that the hip would be going back behind the body up to 30 degrees.  

The Board "is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases." Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018).? Clearly relevant to this case are M21-1 provisions regarding evaluations of limitation of motion of the hip and thigh.? The M21-1 states in an example that "[n]ormal hip ROM [range of motion] is from 0 degrees (fully extended) to 125 degrees (fully flexed)."  Part V, sbpt. iii, ch. 1, sec. A.3.d.  As such, the Board finds that full extension of the hip is 0 degrees.

The statement on the hip and thigh conditions DBQ that the normal extension endpoint is 30 degrees could indicate the possibility of hyperextension, in other words, the hip going toward the back past 0 degrees (or behind the body).  If so, right and left hip extension measured to 25 degrees each would indicate hyperextension, or extension past 0 degrees.  However, expressing such in the negative would have been clearer.  Alternatively, right and left hip extension being limited to 25 degrees, in front of the body, would indicate an inability to fully extend or straighten the hip (in other words, limitation of extension).

Historically, bilateral hip extension was measured to 30 degrees during the August 2016, January 2017, and June 2017 examinations.  Extension to 25 degrees bilaterally during the January 2023 examination may indicate a loss of extension, or worsening, assuming the extension was toward the back.  Alternatively, if extension was limited to 30 or 25 degrees in front of the body, even though there would have been an improvement by getting to 25 degrees, such would still be worse than extension limited to 5 degrees, the criteria for a compensable rating under DC 5251.

In order to warrant a reduction, the evidence must show that the appellant's service-connected right and left hip strains materially improved overall resulting in an improvement in her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  In claims for restoration, the central question is not whether the schedular criteria for a particular rating are met as in a claim for increase, but whether the criteria for reduction were met.  See e.g. Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1990).

In this case, regardless of whether the extension range of motion measurements were in front or behind the body, the Board finds that the record does not support a finding that the appellant's right or left hip strains with limitation of extension actually improved as of January 3, 2023, resulting in an improvement in her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  The examiner recorded no such finding, nor did the appellant report an improvement.

In view of the foregoing, the Board finds that there is no clear basis upon which to conclude that the January 2023 contracted examination results reflected an actual improvement in the appellant's right or left hip strains with limitation of extension.  The Board finds that the RO failed to consider whether such improvement would be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.  In this case, the RO made no such findings, instead basing the reduction solely on the fact that the January 2023 examination indicated that the appellant's range of motion had increased.  In its rating decision, the RO referenced no additional evidence beyond the January 2023 examination report to show that any improvement in the appellant's disabilities would be maintained under ordinary conditions of life.

Under these circumstances, the Board finds that the RO failed to observe the applicable law and regulation in reducing the disability ratings assigned for the appellant's service-connected right and left hip strains with limitation of extension from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective January 3, 2023.  Thus, restoration of the 10 percent ratings is warranted.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations should be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if that disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).

Where a claimant appeals the denial of a claim of an increased disability rating for a disability for which service connection was in effect before she filed the claim for increase, the present level of disability is the primary concern, and past medical reports should not be given precedence over current medical findings.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 57-58 (1994).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy, and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different, or "staged," ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-510 (2007).

Disorders of the hips are rated under DCs 5250 through 5255 of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Hip flexion is measured from 0 degrees to 125 degrees; abduction is measured from 0 degrees to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II.

There is no indication, nor is it asserted, that the appellant has experienced ankylosis of the hip or thigh, or the functional equivalent thereof.  Thus, DC 5250 is not applicable.

DC 5251 pertains to limitation of extension of the thigh.  A maximum 10 percent rating is assigned for extension limited to 5 degrees.

DC 5252 pertains to limitation of flexion of the thigh.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 45 degrees.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 30 degrees.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 20 degrees.  A maximum 40 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 10 degrees.

DC 5253 pertains to impairment of the thigh.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for (a) limitation of rotation, such that one cannot toe-out more than 15 degrees, or (b) limitation of adduction such that one cannot cross legs.  A maximum 20 percent rating is assigned for limitation of abduction such that motion is lost beyond 10 degrees.

There is no indication, nor is it asserted, that the appellant has ankylosis, flail joint of the hip, or any impairment of the femur.  Thus, DCs 5250, 5254, and 5255 are not applicable.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip strain with limitation of flexion (DC 5252).

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left hip strain with limitation of flexion (DC 5252).

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip strain with limitation of extension (DC 5251).

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left hip strain with limitation of extension (DC 5251).

5. Entitlement to a separate compensable rating for right hip strain with impairment of abduction, adduction, and rotation (DC 5253).

6. Entitlement to a separate compensable rating for left hip strain with impairment of abduction, adduction, and rotation (DC 5253).

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that (1) a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip strain with limitation of flexion (DC 5252); (2) a rating in excess of 10 percent for left hip strain with limitation of flexion (DC 5252); (3) a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip strain with limitation of extension (DC 5251); (4) a rating in excess of 10 percent for left hip strain with limitation of extension (DC 5253); (5) a separate compensable rating for right hip strain with impairment of abduction, adduction, and rotation (DC 5251); and (6) a separate compensable rating for left hip strain with impairment of abduction, adduction, and rotation (DC 5253) are not warranted.

The appellant was afforded a contracted hip and thigh conditions examination in January 2023.  The claims file was reviewed.  The appellant described feeling of hip burning and difficulty with sitting.  She also gets up at night due to discomfort.  Flare-ups were denied.  No functional loss or impairment was reported.  Right hip range of motion testing revealed: flexion to 105 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, abduction to 35 degrees, adduction to 20 degrees, external rotation to 40 degrees, and internal rotation to 30 degrees.  Pain was present on right flexion, extension, and adduction.  Left hip range of motion testing revealed: flexion to 110 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, abduction to 30 degrees, adduction to 25 degrees, external rotation to 35 degrees, and internal rotation to 25 degrees.  Pain was present on all left ranges of motion.  The appellant was not limited in adduction with either hip that she was unable to cross her legs.  Passive and active range of motion were the same bilaterally.  Pain was present on active and passive motion but did not result in functional loss.  There was mild tenderness to palpation on the bilateral posterior hips.  There was no additional limitation of motion following repetitive-use testing.  Pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination would not significantly limit functional anility with repeated use over time for either hip.  There were no additional factors contributing to disability for either hip.  There was no atrophy, ankylosis, malunion or nonunion of the femur, flail hip joint, or leg length discrepancy.  There had been no surgical procedures and no assistive devices were used.  Amputation with prosthesis would not equally serve the appellant.  There was no functional impact.

Applying the facts to the criteria set forth above, the Board finds that (1) a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip strain with limitation of flexion (DC 5252); (2) a rating in excess of 10 percent for left hip strain with limitation of flexion (DC 5252); (3) a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip strain with limitation of extension (DC 5251); (4) a rating in excess of 10 percent for left hip strain with limitation of extension (DC 5253); (5) a separate compensable rating for right hip strain with impairment of abduction, adduction, and rotation (DC 5251); and (6) a separate compensable rating for left hip strain with impairment of abduction, adduction, and rotation (DC 5253) are not warranted.

The appellant's right and left hip disabilities have been manifested by limited and painful motion, with burning and difficulty sitting.

Neither the right nor the left hip had flexion limited to 45 degrees or worse, or functional impairment more nearly approximating such.  As such, ratings in excess of 10 percent under DC 5252 are not for application.

By virtue of the restorations of the 10 percent ratings for right and left hip strains limitation of extension, the appellant is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for DC 5251, 10 percent, for each hip for the entire period on appeal. 

The appellant did not experience limitation of rotation, such that one cannot toe-out more than 15 degrees, limitation of adduction such that one cannot cross legs, limitation of abduction with motion lost beyond 10 degrees, or functional impairment more nearly approximating such with respect to either hip.  Thus, a compensable rating under DC 5253 is not warranted for either hip.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the requirement of ankylosis in the General Rating Formula for Injuries and Diseases of the Spine can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis (i.e. functional immobility of the joint) during a flare-up.  Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).  At no point during the period on appeal did the appellant experience ankylosis, or the functional equivalent thereof, of either hip.  Rather, she has retained motion of the right and left hips for the entire appeal period.  It is not contended otherwise.

There is no indication, nor is it asserted, that the appellant has flail joint of the hip or any impairment of the femur.  Thus, DCs 5254 and 5255 are not applicable.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the hip and thigh.  Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); see also Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).

To assign separate ratings under DC 5253 for the same symptoms contemplated by the current compensable ratings for limitation of flexion and extension, namely: noncompensable limited and painful motion, with burning and difficulty sitting, would violate the rule against pyramiding.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14; see also VAOPGCPREC 9-2004 (2004) (discussing how separate ratings may be assigned under DCs 5260 and 5261 where there is compensable limitation of flexion and extension in the context of knee disabilities). 

Finally, in reaching this decision, the Board acknowledges that it cannot consider the ameliorative effects of medication.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012).  However, because the appellant reported during the January 2023 examination that there was no current treatment for her hips.  In other words, no medication was being taken.  As such, there are no ameliorative effects to discount.  See also Ingram v. Collins, ___ Vet. App. ___ , No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (March 12, 2025).

As the evidence is not in approximate balance and is persuasively against the appellant's contentions, the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
