REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran submitted a June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), and elected the Direct Review docket.  

In February 2025, the Veteran submitted a written statement requesting a withdrawal of his appeals for entitlement to service connection for migraines, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and sinusitis.  February 2025 VA Form 21-4138.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(3).  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(a).  It must include the name of the veteran or appellant, the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).

In the present case, the Veteran submitted a written and signed statement with his name, applicable VA file number, and request to withdraw his appeals for entitlement to service connection for migraines, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and sinusitis.  February 2025 VA Form 21-4138.  He indicated having additional evidence to submit and would like the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) to adjudicate those claims through a supplemental claim rather than with his appeal to the Board.  Id.  The Board finds his request meets the requirements listed at 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 for a valid withdrawal of appeal.

The Board notes that the Veteran's June 2024 appeal to the Board contains several other claims which are not part of his February 2025 withdrawal request.  See June 2024 VA Form 10182; February 2025 VA Form 21-4138.  The Veteran also acknowledged that his appeal to the Board is untimely and submitted a statement as to why.  June 2024 VA Form 10182.  However, the Board has not considered whether his appeal to the Board is timely, nor whether there is good cause for an extension to file, because the Veteran had also filed a request for a copy of his claims file that has not yet been fulfilled.  See December 2024 VA Form 20-10206. The Board dismisses his appeals for entitlement to service connection for migraines, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and sinusitis only because the Veteran requested we do so as soon as possible so he can file a supplemental claim.  February 2025 VA Form 21 4138.  The appeal for his other claims listed in the June 2024 VA Form 10182 will be addressed separately and at a later time after VA provides him a copy of his claims file.

As the Veteran's appeal for entitlement to service connection for migraines, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and sinusitis have been withdrawn, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration on those claims.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review those appeals, and they are dismissed.
