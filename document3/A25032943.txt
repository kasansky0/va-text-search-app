DOCKET NO. 240219-419684
DATE: April 9, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for headaches is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran honorably served on active duty from March 2016 to March 2020.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024, rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

As the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the re-adjudication.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to service connection for headaches.

The Veteran's claim for service connection for headaches must be remanded to cure a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Board herein makes no finding regarding the Veteran's credibility.  Smith v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 332, 334 (2020).

The October 2023 VA etiological opinion is conclusory in stating that the Veteran's headaches were not caused by his service connected tinnitus.  Moreover, the examiner failed to provide any opinion as to whether the Veteran's headaches were aggravated by his service-connected tinnitus.  Thus, remand is required for another etiological opinion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an appropriate examination to address the issue of entitlement to service connection for headaches. The examiner should then respond to the following:

(a.) Is it approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's headaches were caused by his service connected tinnitus?

(b.) Is it approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's headaches were aggravated by his service-connected tinnitus?

The examiner should explain the reasons for the conclusions reached and should provide separate rationales for each question if appropriate. The examiner is asked not to provide any hyperlinks as part of the rendered opinion.
