DOCKET NO. 240531-444275
DATE:  April 9, 2025

ORDER

Restoration of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), effective December 1, 2023, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time the Veteran's TDIU rating was discontinued, there was no clear and convincing evidence that he was gainfully employed.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The discontinuance of entitlement to a TDIU, effective December 1, 2023, was improper. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.343, 4.16 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from September 2005 to June 2008. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801 (2024). 

Restoration - TDIU 

The Veteran challenges the discontinuation of his entitlement to a TDIU, effective December 1, 2023. 

A disability rating of 100 percent based on individual unemployability may be reduced, subject to the procedural protections of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), but caution must be exercised in such a determination that "actual employability" is established by clear and convincing evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.343(c)(1). A finding of "actual employability" must encompass a finding that the Veteran is no longer unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The "clear and convincing" standard of proof requires that capacity for work be proven to a "reasonable certainty" but not necessarily be "undebatable." Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999). The said standard is held to be an intermediate standard between preponderance of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt. Fagan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 48, 55 (1999); Olson v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 430, 434 (1993).

In assessing the propriety of the AOJ's decision to discontinue the Veteran's TDIU benefits, the Board must focus on the evidence of record available to the AOJ at the time the rating determination at issue was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered for the limited purpose of determining whether actual improvement (or, as here, employability) was shown. Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 281-82 (1992).

In September 2023, the AOJ mailed the Veteran a notification letter proposing to discontinue his continued eligibility to the TDIU benefit based upon evidence that he had sustained gainful employment during the previous calendar year. The letter contained all the information required by 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), including the contemplated action, furnished detailed reasons therefor, and 60-day response period. He did not request a hearing within 30 days of receiving notice. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i). In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ discontinued entitlement to a TDIU, effective December 1, 2023. Having found that the procedural protections of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) have been satisfied, the Board turns to the question of the Veteran's actual employability. 

In a March 2015 legacy rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to a TDIU, effective November 28, 2014. The AOJ relied primarily on the findings from a VA PTSD examination report from January 2015. At that time, the Veteran reported that he was unemployed and had lost several jobs. He stated that he had a drinking problem, had not work well with his dad or former supervisors, and would become angry with customers or something at work. Further, he endorsed impaired judgment, impaired impulse control, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances.

In discontinuing the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU in the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran earned wages above poverty threshold for the 2022 calendar year according to Social Security Administration (SSA) records. 

At the outset, the Board notes that the claims file does not include records from the SSA regarding the Veteran's income and earnings from any calendar year, including 2022. To the extent that the Veteran may have had earned wages above the poverty threshold in 2022, the Board finds that clear and convincing evidence has not been established that the Veteran is no longer unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected PTSD. Notably, the Veteran had an unstable job history consisting of various and/or short-term positions due to his PTSD. Furthermore, there had been no impactful change in the functional limitations caused by his PTSD at the time his entitlement to a TDIU had been discontinued. Hence, the Veteran's capacity to work is not proven by reasonable certainty.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence for and against the claim is in approximate balance. Therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to restoration of a TDIU, effective December 1, 2023, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
