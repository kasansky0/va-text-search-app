DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for lumbar spine segmental and somatic dysfunction (hereafter referred to as "spine disability") is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's current spine disability is not related to his military service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a spine disability is not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2012 to November 2018, and from February 2020 to February 2022. See DD-214. The Veteran also served a period of active duty from October 2023 to December 2023. See January 2024 Return to Active Duty Termination Letter. 

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2023 decision. In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2023 decision.  

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in, or aggravated by, active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service, but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events, or the presence of disability, or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Although lay persons are considered competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside of the realm of common knowledge of a lay person. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. See Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992); Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164 (1991). Equal weight is not necessarily accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; not every item of evidence necessarily has the same probative value.

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Evidence

In April 2012, the Veteran underwent an enlistment examination where his spine was marked normal upon clinical evaluation. See STR - April 2012 Report of Medical Examination.

In September 2018, the Veteran was seen for a Separation From Military Uniformed Service examination. The Veteran denied experiencing any recurrent back pain or any back problems. See STR - September 2018 Separation Examination.

In August 2019, the Veteran underwent an annual examination. The Veteran had no waivers, no fitness restrictions, and had not been placed on temporary profile or limited duty in the past two years. The Veteran stated he did vigorous physical activities three days a week for 35 minutes, did light or moderate physical activities two days per week for 30 minutes, and did physical activities designed to strengthen his muscles three days per week. The Veteran denied having an injury, illness or disease which was incurred or aggravated while in duty status since his last physical examination. See STR - August 2019 Periodic Health Assessment. 

In December 2019, the Veteran was found medically qualified to continue enlistment. See STR - December 2019 Review of Medical Examination by State Air Surgeon Memorandum. 

In November 2020, the Veteran underwent an annual physical examination. Under Review of Systems, the Veteran's musculoskeletal system was noted to have no muscle aches or limb swelling. The Veteran had normal movement of all extremities. See STR - November 2020 Periodic Health Assessment. 

In December 2021, the Veteran underwent an annual physical examination. The Veteran has no complaints or concerns and took no mediations or had any waivers. Under Review of Systems, the Veteran's musculoskeletal system was noted to have no back pain, and the Veteran's mobility was not limited. See STR- December 2021 Periodic Health Assessment. 

In January 2023, the Veteran was seen at a chiropractic clinic due to complaints of mid to low back pain. The Veteran reported that the symptoms first appeared in 2018 while working out and appeared to recently get worse. The Veteran was diagnosed with segmental and somatic dysfunction of the cervical spine region 2, segmental and somatic dysfunction of the thoracic region at T10-12 with myalgia and thoracic radiculopathy, segmental and somatic dysfunction of the lumbar region L1, L5, and the right sacroiliac joint. See February 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.  

Analysis

The Veteran contends that his spine disability occurred as a result of physical exercise while in service in 2018. See December 2022 VA 21-526EZ and January 2024 Appellate Brief. 

First, the Board is bound by favorable AOJ findings provided that they are not clearly and unmistakably erroneous. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The AOJ found that the Veteran has a current spine disability.  This finding is confirmed by medical evidence showing a current diagnosis of segmental and somatic dysfunction of the spine. See February 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.  

The Veteran's STRs and Military Personnel Record are silent as to any medical treatment or complaints of any back pain or spine disability. While the Veteran asserts that he began experiencing back pain in 2018, the record contains several assertions from the Veteran that he had no back pain, either at the time of the examination or recurrent. Additionally, the record contains no outside contemporaneous medical records concerning the Veteran's back or lay statements about his back. Based on this, the Board finds that the most probative evidence does not support that there was an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a back injury. 

During a January 2023 visit to a chiropractic clinic, the Veteran reported he experienced back pain as a result of exercising while in service in 2018. As a layperson, he is competent to report observable symptoms that he witnessed firsthand. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). However, as a layperson, the Veteran is not shown to possess the medical expertise to opine about the etiology of his spine disability because it is outside the realm of knowledge of a lay person. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011). His lay evidence cannot be accepted as competent evidence of a nexus.

The record does not contain a nexus statement relating the Veteran's current disabilities to his military service. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was not provided a VA examination for his spine claim. As stated above, VA is obliged to provide an examination or obtain a medical opinion in a claim when the record indicates that the disability may be associated with active service. 38 U.S.C.§ 5103A(d); McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79. However, the duty to provide an examination is not limitless. Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F. 3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The McLendon threshold elements must be satisfied before VA is obliged to provide an examination or opinion. Id. A conclusory generalized lay statement that a service event or illness caused the claimant's current condition is insufficient to establish medical etiology or nexus to require an examination under McLendon. Waters, 601 F.3d at 1278-79. Here, aside from the Veteran's generalized statement that his spine disability is related to service, the record is absent of any in-service injury, event, or occurrence suggestive of a positive nexus relationship with his current disability. Therefore, the Mclendon threshold has not been satisfied and VA was not required to provide an examination or nexus opinion.

Based on the record, the Board finds there is no competent nexus between the Veteran's service and his spine disability. The record is absent of any other medical or lay evidence suggesting otherwise. The Veteran has not submitted a competent medical opinion in favor of his claim.

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the service connection claim for spine disability and as such, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021). The appeal is denied.
