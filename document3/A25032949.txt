DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the proposed reduction in the rating for posttraumatic stress disorder to include alcohol dependency and traumatic brain injury (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The February 2023 rating decision that proposed to reduce the rating for the Veteran's PTSD is not an appealable decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the proposed reduction in the rating for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1997 to February 2005.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The appeal of the proposed reduction in the rating for PTSD.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. 

For reductions, 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) requires the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) to issue a rating decision proposing the reduction and setting forth all material facts and reasons, notify the beneficiary of the contemplated action and furnish detailed reasons therefore, and allow 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that payments should continue at the present level. If a reduction is found to be warranted upon consideration of any additional evidence submitted, final rating action will be taken, and compensation will be reduced effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice of the final action expires. See Stelzel v. Mansfield, 508 F.3d 1345, 1347-49 (Fed. Cir. 2007); VAOPGCPREC 71-91 (Nov. 7, 1991).

In the February 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ proposed a decrease in the rating for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD from 100 percent to 70 percent. In the accompanying notification letter, the Veteran was given notice of the proposal as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). 

Because the February 2023 rating decision was merely the AOJ's proposal to reduce the Veteran's PTSD rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), rather than a final rating action reducing the Veteran's rating, it is not an appealable decision. Indeed, the Veteran's PTSD rating was reduced in a September 2023 rating decision, which was after the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Notice of Disagreement (Notice of Disagreement), was received. Thus, this matter must be dismissed.

The Board notes that the Veteran's spouse filled out the April 2023 Notice of Disagreement, explicitly listing herself as the person completing it. However, the Veteran signed it, along with his spouse, so the Board has interpreted the Notice of Disagreement to be filed by the Veteran. The Veteran and his spouse are encouraged to keep in mind that a Notice of Disagreement may only be filed by a claimant personally or by their representative. If the claimant is rated incompetent by VA or has a physical, mental, or legal disability which prevents the claimant from acting on their own behalf, a Notice of Disagreement may also be filed by a VA- or court-appointed fiduciary or by a person acting as next friend if the appointed fiduciary fails to take needed action or no fiduciary has been appointed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204.
