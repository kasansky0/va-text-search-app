ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable disability evaluation for left leg shin splints is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable disability evaluation for right leg shin splints is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left leg shin splints are manifested by treatment for 12 consecutive months or more, but not by unresponsive treatment to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment.

2. The Veteran's right leg shin splints are manifested by treatment for 12 consecutive months or more, but not by unresponsive treatment to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable disability evaluation for left leg shin splints have not been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.159, 4.1, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5262.

2. The criteria for a compensable disability evaluation for right leg shin splints have not been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.159, 4.1, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5262.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 2000 to June 2009.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. The AMA modernized review system applies to all claims for which VA issues a notice of an initial decision on or after the February 19, 2019 effective date of the modernized review system.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 Higher Level Review decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran's increased rating claim for her shin splints was previously denied in a May 2023 rating decision which the Veteran timely appealed by filing a December 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the direct review option. For the Direct Lane docket, the Board's review is limited to the evidentiary record at the time of the RO decision on appeal. See Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 151, (2021). 

The Board interprets the Veteran's selection of the Direct Review option with an indication of a decision being rendered within 365 days as well as statements of record as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the claim finding that the Veteran does not wish to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).?38?U.S.C. §?1155;?38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.2, 4.10.? 

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition. The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589 (1991). The medical, as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required. 38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.2, 4.10. 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.? Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.?See?38?C.F.R. §?4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.?38?C.F.R. §?4.3.? Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings.?Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established, and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.?See?Francisco v. Brown,?7?Vet. App.?55, 58 (1994).? Nevertheless, where the evidence contains factual findings that show a change in the severity of symptoms?during the course of?the rating period on appeal, assignment of staged ratings would be permissible.?See?Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2007).??? 

Pyramiding, which is the evaluation of the same disability or the same manifestation of a disability under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when evaluating a Veteran's service-connected disability.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.14.? ? 

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a Veteran prevailing in either event, or the evidence is persuasively against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.?38?U.S.C. §?5107 (b);?38?C.F.R. §?3.102.

1. Entitlement to a compensable disability evaluation for left leg shin splints is denied.

2. Entitlement to a compensable disability evaluation for right leg shin splints is denied.

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance. It is essential that the examination on which ratings are based adequately portray the anatomical damage, and the functional loss, with respect to all these elements.? 

The functional loss may be due to absence of part, or all, of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective enervation, or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion. Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.?38?C.F.R. §§?4.10, 4.40, 4.45; see also DeLuca v. Brown,?8?Vet. App.?202?(1995). The provisions of?38?C.F.R. §?4.14?(avoidance of pyramiding) do not forbid consideration of a higher rating based on greater limitation of motion due to pain on use, including during flareups. The provisions of?38?C.F.R. §?4.40?and?38?C.F.R. §?4.45?are to be considered in conjunction with the diagnostic codes predicated on limitation of motion. See Johnson v. Brown,?9?Vet. App.?7?(1996). Painful motion is an important factor of disability, and it is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. See?38?C.F.R. §?4.59; Burton v. Shinseki,?25?Vet. App.?1?(2011). Nevertheless, pain itself does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by the VA regulations applicable to the musculoskeletal system. Mitchell v. Shinseki,?25?Vet. App.?32?(2011). Moreover, functional impairment must be supported by adequate pathology.?Id.: Johnson v. Brown,?9?Vet. App.?7, 10?(1996) (both citing to?38?C.F.R. §?4.40).?

Regarding knee claims, a claimant who has arthritis and instability of the knee may be rated separately under Diagnostic Codes 5003, 5260, 5261, and 5257. See VAOPGCPREC 23-97. For example, when a knee disability is already rated under DC 5257 (addressing lateral instability), a separate rating may be warranted if the Veteran's knee also shows limitation of motion that at least meets the criteria for a zero-percent rating under DC 5260 (flexion limited to 60 degrees or less) or 5261 (extension limited to 5 degrees or more). See VAOPGCPREC 09-04. Moreover, a separate rating could be warranted under?38?C.F.R. §?4.59, based on x-ray findings of arthritis with painful motion.? 

Limitation of motion of the knee is contemplated in?38?C.F.R. §?4.71A, Diagnostic Codes 5260 and 5261. Normal range of knee motion is 140 degrees of flexion and zero degrees of extension.?38?C.F.R. §?4.71, Plate II.? 

Diagnostic Code 5260 provides for a zero percent evaluation where flexion of the leg is only limited to 60 degrees. For a 10 percent evaluation, flexion must be limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent evaluation is warranted where flexion is limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent evaluation may be assigned where flexion is limited to 15 degrees.?38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.? 

Diagnostic Code 5261 provides for a zero percent evaluation where extension of the leg is limited to five degrees. A 10 percent evaluation requires extension limited to 10 degrees. A 20 percent evaluation is warranted where extension is limited to 15 degrees. A 30 percent evaluation may be assigned where the evidence shows extension limited to 20 degrees. For a 40 percent evaluation, extension must be limited to 30 degrees. And finally, where extension is limited to 45 degrees a 50 percent evaluation may be assigned.?38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.? 

Under Diagnostic Code 5262, a 10 percent rating is warranted when treatment is required for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment with one or both lower extremities. A 20 percent rating is warranted when treatment is required for no less than 12 consecutive months, is unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or conservative treatment if the condition affects one lower extremity. A 30 percent rating is warranted when treatment is required for no less than 12 consecutive months, is unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or conservative treatment if the condition affects both lower extremities. A 30 percent rating is warranted if the condition affects both lower extremities and is unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or conservative treatment. A 40 percent rating is assigned for nonunion of the tibia and fibula, with loose motion, requiring a brace.

As for Diagnostic Code 5257, subluxation or instability with unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and medical provider prescribes both an assistive device and bracing for ambulation warrants a 30 percent rating; either a sprain with an incomplete ligament tear or repaired complete ligament tear, causing persistent instability and a medical provider has prescribed a brace and/or assistive device for ambulation or unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device or bracing for ambulation warrants a 20 percent rating; and a sprain, incomplete ligament tear or a complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device or bracing for ambulation warrants a 10 percent rating. 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257. 

Also under Diagnostic 5257, patellar instability, a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace, and either a cane or walker warrants a 30 percent rating; a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider of one of the following: a brace, cane or walker warrants a 20 percent rating; a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with or without a history of surgical repair that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane or walker warrants a 10 percent rating.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257. 

Note 1 provides that for patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps, tendon, patella, and the patellar tendon. 

Note 2 provides that a surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more of the patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for patellar instability (including but not limited to arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration). 

Diagnostic Code 5024 governs tenosynovitis, tendinitis, tendinosis, and tendinopathy. The Note for Diagnostic Code 5024 directed that diseases under Diagnostic Codes 5013 through 5024 should be evaluated as degenerative arthritis, based on limitation of motion of the affected parts.

The Board notes that Diagnostic Code 5055, governing ratings for residuals of a total knee replacement, Diagnostic Codes 5263 governing evaluations for genu recurvatum, Diagnostic Code 5258 and 5259 governing semilunar cartilage conditions, and Diagnostic Code 5256 governing ankylosis are not applicable as the Veteran does not have any of these conditions. Thus, these provisions will not be further addressed.?38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5055, 5256, 5258, 5259, 5263.? 

Factual Background

The Veteran filed a new claim for increased rating for her shin splints in February 2023, the Veteran filed an intent to file on January 25, 2023. The Veteran was previously in receipt of a noncompensable disability evaluation for her bilateral shin splints under Diagnostic Code 5299-5262 effective December 29, 2014. The Veteran is currently in receipt of a noncompensable disability evaluation for her bilateral shin splints under Diagnostic Code 5262 effective January 25, 2023. 

Following her February 2023 claim, the Veteran was awarded a 10 percent disability evaluation for both left and right leg tendinopathy under Diagnostic Code 5260, a 10 percent disability evaluation for both left and right knee instability under Diagnostic Code 5257, and a noncompensable disability evaluation for left and right leg tendinopathy under Diagnostic Code 5261, effective January 25, 2023. These ratings were awarded in a May 2023 rating decision, the Veteran did not appeal these ratings in the December 2023 Request for Higher-Level Review.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement the Veteran appealed the April 2024 Higher Level Review decision which addressed only the Veteran's rating for shin splints. In August 2024 correspondence from the Veteran's representative, the representative reiterated the Veteran is only seeking an increased rating for her bilateral shin splints. Thus, the Veteran's additional ratings under Diagnostic Codes 5260, 5261, and 5257 are not on appeal herein.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for her shin splints in March 2023. At that time, the examiner found the Veteran had a diagnosis of bilateral shin splints bilateral tendinopathy, and bilateral instability. The Veteran reported pain and that she was unable to walk or stand for long periods of time. She stated she cannot walk, bend, knee, stand or run without pain. 

Regarding the right knee, on initial range of motion testing, the Veteran exhibited abnormal motion of her right knee. The Veteran exhibited flexion to 140 degrees and extension to 5 degrees. The examiner noted the Veteran experienced pain with flexion, extension, active and passive motion, and weightbearing, but not on non-weightbearing or rest. The Veteran reported no localized tenderness. With respect to repetitive use, the Veteran was able to perform at least three repetitions with no additional functional loss. The examiner noted that the examination was conducted after repeated use over time and concluded pain, fatiguability, weakness, and lack of endurance would contribute to additional functional loss. The examiner estimated the Veteran's range of motion with repeated use over time to be flexion to 125 degrees and extension to 5 degrees. The Veteran did not report flare ups of the right knee.

Regarding the left knee, on initial range of motion testing, the Veteran exhibited abnormal motion of her left knee. The Veteran exhibited flexion to 140 degrees and extension to 5 degrees. The examiner noted the Veteran experienced pain with flexion, extension, active and passive motion, and weightbearing, but not on non-weightbearing or rest. The Veteran reported localized tenderness to the medial and lateral knee. With respect to repetitive use, the Veteran was able to perform at least three repetitions with no additional functional loss. The examiner noted that the examination was conducted after repeated use over time and concluded pain and lack of endurance would contribute to additional functional loss. The examiner estimated the Veteran's range of motion with repeated use over time to be flexion to 125 degrees and extension to 0 degrees. The Veteran reported flare ups of the left knee. The examiner noted the examination was not being conducted during a flare up, but indicated pain, fatiguability, weakness, and lack of endurance would limit functional ability during flare-ups. The examiner estimated the Veteran's range of motion during flare ups to be flexion to 125 degrees and extension to 5 degrees.

The examiner indicated the Veteran suffered from shin splints bilaterally requiring treatment for 12 consecutive months or more. The Veteran did not report the use of orthotics, assistive devices, or surgery. There was no indication the Veteran was unresponsive to shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment. The Veteran was additionally noted to experience crepitus and recurrent instability bilaterally. 

The examiner concluded the Veteran did not experience ankylosis, a meniscus condition, patellar instability, stress fracture, or genu recurvatum, nor had the Veteran undergone surgery for either knee. The examiner further noted that the Veteran is not prescribed an assistive device. 

At the conclusion of the examination, the examiner opined that for the VA established diagnoses of left and right leg shin splints, the diagnosis is changed to tendinopathy and instability as a progression of her current condition.

Analysis

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a separate compensable disability evaluation for the Veteran's shin splints under Diagnostic Code 5262 is not warranted. Although the Veteran's shin splints required treatment for 12 consecutive months or more, the record does not show the Veteran's shin splints are unresponsive to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment. Furthermore, the Veteran's shin splint symptoms, including pain and instability are considered under the Veteran's 10 percent disability evaluation for tendinopathy and instability under Diagnostic Codes 5260 and 5257. A separate compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5262 for the Veteran's pain and instability would violate the rule against pyramiding. 38?C.F.R. §?4.14.?

Further, there is no evidence of compensable limitation of extension or flexion. Thus, a higher rating is not warranted for limitation of motion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5260, 5261.

With regard to additional compensation for functional loss, the Board has considered the provisions of?38?C.F.R. §§?4.40, 4.45, 4.59, and the holdings in DeLuca.? The Board has also considered Correia v. McDonald,?28?Vet. App.?158, 169-70?(2016) and Sharp v. Shulkin,?29?Vet. App.?26, 330?(2017).?The record reveals that the Veteran experiences functional loss symptoms of pain as well as crepitus; however, these symptoms are already being compensated in the Veteran's assigned ratings. Further, there is no evidence in the record or at the examinations that the Veteran's shin splint symptoms caused reduced range of motion due to functional loss or during flare-ups, for which she is not already being compensated. Accordingly, there is no additional compensation for functional loss warranted?at any time during the appeal period. 38?C.F.R. §§?4.40, 4.45, 4.59. Nor is there any evidence of the equivalent of ankylosis during flare-ups. Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet.App. 1 (2021) (the Court explained that the ankylosis requirement "can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis during a flare.").

Accordingly, the Board finds that a compensable disability evaluation for shin splints under Diagnostic Code 5262 is not warranted, and the Veteran's claim is denied.?
