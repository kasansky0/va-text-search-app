Entitlement to service connection for a cardiovascular condition is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a lung condition is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active-duty military service from December 1965 to December 1967. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting a December 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review lane for additional development that resulted in a July 2024 decision. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for a cardiovascular condition and a lung condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

In October 2024, the Veteran waived his right to select a different Board review option. Thus, the Board may proceed with the claim. 

1-2. Entitlement to service connection for a cardiovascular condition and a lung condition is remanded.

The Veteran is asserting that he has a cardiovascular and lung condition that is related to exposures to radioactive materials while performing military duties at a military missile range. See February 2023 Correspondence. The Veteran also asserted that he was exposed to asbestos, toxic propellant fuels, and beryllium. Id. In June 2023, VA received a letter from the Veteran that included an assertion of "agent orange" exposure. See June 2023 Correspondence.

In October 2023 the RO denied the Veteran's claims via a supplemental rating decision. A December 2023 higher level review indicated that it was a duty to assist (DTA) error to deny the Veteran's claims without attempting verification of the Veteran's agent orange exposure assertions or completing a more thorough toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) analysis to include the completion of an update TERA memorandum. See December 2023 VA Form 20-0999.  The Board agrees. 

The Board finds that the July 2024 rating decision continued the denials without completing the directives listed in the December 2023 DTA citation. In addition, the Board notes that March 2023 and July 2024 VA medical opinions did not thoroughly discuss the Veteran's express assertions regarding multiple in-service exposures; as such, the Board finds the March 2023 and July 2024 medical opinions inadequate.

Unlike in the legacy system, the reasons for remand by the Board in the modernized review system are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors); and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a remand is warranted to ensure compliance with the December 2023 higher level review as well as ensuring that the examiner considers the Veteran's express assertions.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Please complete the directives enumerated in the December 19, 2023 VA Form 20-0999 to include the listed herbicide verification exposure development and the outlined enhanced TERA development. 

2. Upon completion of the directives, obtain addendum opinions from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's cardiovascular and lung conditions are at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) caused by exposure to hazardous materials, radiation and agent orange after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

Please cite March 23, 2023 VA examination reports, September 4, 2023 Correspondence, June 16, 2023 Correspondence, July 11, 2024 VA medical opinions, and any evidence obtained from the directed development listed above.  Please specifically request that the examiner discuss the Veteran's express contentions.
