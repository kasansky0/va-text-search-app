DOCKET NO. 240820-475231
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the issues of service connection for a back disability and entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In February 2025, the Appellant died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Appellant, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran in this case had active service in the U.S. Air Force from March 1964 to February 1968.  He died in June 2021.  

The Appellant was his spouse and had substituted in his place for the purposes of this appeal, which comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from February 2012 and October 2013 rating decisions.  It proceeded through the legacy claims process until an August 2024 supplemental statement of the case (SSOC).  

The Appellant opted the claims into the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), by submitting an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, identifying the August 2024 SSOC.  

Unfortunately, the Appellant died in February 2025 during the pendency of the appeal.  Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claims at this time and must dismiss this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Appellant's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the appellant's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b).  Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the Appellant.  Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant." The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/.

If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the Appellant's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).
