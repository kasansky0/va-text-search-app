ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the right upper extremity (RUE radiculopathy) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's radiculopathy is manifested by no more than mild incomplete paralysis of the right upper extremity.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for RUE radiculopathy have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8511.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1988 to December 1990.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2019 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the September 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2019 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

This matter was previously denied by the Board in a February 2024 decision.  The Veteran appealed the issue to the Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (CAVC), where it was partially remanded to the Board for further development. See September 2024 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR).  

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Separate evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time if such distinct periods are shown by the competent evidence of record during the appeal, a practice known as "staged" ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). VA's determination of the present level of a disability may result in a conclusion that the disability has undergone varying and distinct levels of severity throughout the entire time period the increased-rating claim has been pending. Hart v. Mansfield, supra.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the right upper extremity (RUE radiculopathy) is denied.

The Veteran seeks a higher initial rating for her RUE radiculopathy.  See September 2020 VA Form 10182.

The Veteran is currently rated at 20 percent for RUE radiculopathy under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5811.  The appeal period begins on February 19, 2019, with the submission of her VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. The Veteran is right-handed.

Under Diagnostic Code 8511, the following ratings apply: a 20 percent rating is warranted for mild incomplete paralysis of both the minor and major extremity; a 40 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis of the major extremity and a 30 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis of the minor extremity; a 50 percent rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis of the major extremity and a 40 percent rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis of the minor extremity; and a 60 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis of the minor extremity, with adduction, abduction and rotation of arm, flexion of elbow, and extension of wrist lost or severely affected. A 70 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis of the major extremity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8511.

Terms such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" are not defined in the regulations, nor are specific symptoms associated with those terms. Spellers v. Wilkie,?30?Vet. App.?211, 219?(2018). However, one possible source of definitions is the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual (hereinafter, the "Manual").

While the Manual is not binding on the Board, there are provisions of the Manual that address the terms in Diagnostic Code 8511. See DAV v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs,?859 F.3d 1072, 1077?(Fed. Cir. 2017). Specifically, the Manual discusses the terminology in?38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8510-8730. See VA ADJUDICATION PROCEDURES MANUAL, M21-1, III.iv.4.N.4.c (Nov. 16, 2017). The Manual must be addressed by the Board where relevant. See Wilson v. McDonough,?35?Vet. App.?75, 80?(2021).

In cases where a peripheral nerve disability is only manifested by sensory impairment, the Manual provides:

To make a choice between mild and moderate, consider the evidence of record and the following guidelines: The mild level of evaluation would be more reasonably assigned when sensory symptoms are recurrent but not continuous, assigned a lower medical grade reflecting less impairment, and/or affecting a smaller area in the nerve distribution. Reserve the moderate level of evaluation for the most significant and disabling cases of sensory-only involvement. These are cases where the sensory symptoms are continuous, assigned a higher medical grade reflecting greater impairment, and/or affecting a larger area in the nerve distribution."

VA ADJUDICATION PROCEDURES MANUAL, M21-1, III.iv.4.N.4.b (Feb. 2, 2018).

The Manual further provides that, for "severe" incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve, marked muscle atrophy is expected. In general, severe incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve involves motor and/or reflex impairment "(for example atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability." Id. "Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve." Id.

Turning to the evidence, in a January 23, 2018, VA treatment record, the Veteran reported right hand pain in the saddle joint of the right thumb, that "gets stuck since early December."

In a January 24, 2018, VA treatment record, the Veteran was referred for a consult with rheumatology for workup on a possible diagnosis of arthritis of the right thumb. The clinical indication listed rheumatoid arthritis, "RA." Veteran refused to schedule the consult due to wanting community care instead, so the consult was discontinued.

In a September 11, 2018, VA treatment record, the Veteran reported right elbow and right thumb pain. The examiner noted a history of bursitis with symptoms of tennis elbow and a new onset of thumb pain.

In an October 24, 2018, VA treatment record, the Veteran called the triage advice line with complaints of right thumb and elbow swelling for 6 weeks.  She reported a pain level of 5/10, especially with pressure on the elbow.  She also reported that her thumb has been intermittently swollen for two years, "but swelling returned yesterday" and she was "unable to bend thumb."

In an October 25, 2018, VA treatment record, the Veteran complained of right elbow pain for six weeks.  She presented a self-diagnosis of olecranon bursitis and the examiner's diagnosis was olecranon bursitis with lateral epicondylitis.

Also on October 25, 2018, an occupational therapist assessed the right elbow pain as mild pain at the olecranon "more consistent with olecranon bursitis vs. lateral epicondylitis."

In an April 2019 VA examination, the Veteran reported RUE radiculopathy. The examiner recorded no constant or intermittent pain, but mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and numbness in the right upper extremity. The examiner assessed the Veteran's RUE radiculopathy as mild. In assessing additional neurologic abnormalities, the examiner noted the Veteran's report of pain in both shoulders.

After considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's radiculopathy is manifested by no more than mild incomplete paralysis of the right upper extremity.

To that end, the Veteran's RUE radiculopathy manifested with only mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and numbness in the April 2019 VA examination. There was no pain noted on the April 2019 VA examination.  Moreover, the Veteran's prior reports of right thumb pain were associated with possible rheumatoid arthritis.  See January 24, 2018, VA treatment record.  Notably, the Veteran failed to complete her consult to rule out arthritis and obtain a formal diagnosis for the right thumb pain.  Further, her additional reports of right thumb swelling and ankylosis are not consistent with a rating of radiculopathy contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  See January 23, 2018; October 24, 2018, VA treatment records.  

Additionally, the record is negative for, and the Veteran has not alleged, lost or diminished reflexes or muscle atrophy. Therefore, an initial rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for the RUE radiculopathy at any time during the period on appeal.

In the September 2024 JMPR, CAVC directed the Board to "clarify its finding regarding the September 2018 and October 25, 2018, treatment records." 

Concerning the September 11, 2018 VA treatment record, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the thumb pain and swelling reported was due to a possible diagnosis of arthritis, as this was the consulted recommendation.  These symptoms are also not contemplated neurologic symptoms under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  There is no positive evidence that the Veteran's right thumb pain reported in the January 24, 2018, treatment record was due to her RUE radiculopathy, nor has the Veteran or her representative asserted as much.  While the Board does not discount that the pain is real, the Board notes that failure to complete a medical work-up does not constitute positive evidence for the etiology of the reported pain as being due to the RUE radiculopathy.  Moreover, the October 24, 2018, VA treatment record shows that the Veteran reported intermittent swelling of the right thumb for two years and that she was unable to bend the thumb.  This suggests that the Veteran's right thumb pain was a separate condition, as there was no indication of a neurological involvement. Thus, the Board finds that these treatment records are not probative to the issue on appeal because there is no positive evidence related to the appealed issue.

Concerning the October 25, 2018, VA treatment records, although the record indicates there was constant pain in the right elbow, both the treating provider and the occupation therapist have opined that this pain was due to a nonservice-connected condition of olecranon bursitis and/or lateral epicondylitis.  As such, the Board finds this record is also not probative to the issue on appeal as these are nonservice-connected conditions, and there has been no argument or evidence raising a theory of aggravation to the RUE radiculopathy.

The Board has reviewed other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to upper extremity neurological disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. As the evidence is clear that the rated disabilities stem from upper radicular nerve impairment, and Diagnostic Code 8510 is the appropriate provision under which to rate the Veteran's right upper extremity radiculopathy.

In reaching its conclusions, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's belief that her RUE radiculopathy is more severe than as reflected by the currently assigned disability ratings. The Board must consider the entire evidence of record when analyzing the criteria laid out in the rating schedule. While the Board recognizes that the Veteran is competent to provide evidence regarding her symptomatology, she is not competent to provide an opinion regarding the severity of her symptomatology in accordance with the rating criteria. See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007). Ultimately, the Board finds the medical evidence in which professionals with medical expertise examined the Veteran, acknowledged her reported symptoms, and described the manifestations of the Veteran's RUE radiculopathy in light of the rating criteria to be more persuasive than her reports regarding the severity of her RUE radiculopathy.

Consideration has been given to assigning staged ratings. However, at no time during the period in question have the disabilities warranted higher schedular ratings than those assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, supra. Further, neither the Veteran nor her representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the increased rating claims adjudicated herein. Doucette v. Shulkin, supra.

In consideration of the above, the Board finds the probative evidence weighs persuasively against a finding of moderate incomplete paralysis of the major extremity.  As such, an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for RUE radiculopathy is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
