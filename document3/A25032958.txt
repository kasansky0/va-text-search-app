ISSUE

The validity of debt created due to overpayment in the amount of $3,979.68, as a result of failure to withhold attorney fees from retroactive benefits awarded to the Veteran and whether the overpayment resulted from sole administrative error on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) without the payee's knowledge that it was erroneous.

ORDER

An overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits in the amount of $3,979.68, was properly created; the appeal is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In July 2015, the Veteran and his representative entered into a valid fee agreement allowing for direct payment from VA to the representative of 20 percent of a retroactive award of VA benefits.

2. In May 2018, VA notified the Veteran that he was entitled to a retroactive Concurrent Receipt of Retired and Disability Pay (CRDP) compensation payment of $20,224.69 for the period May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2018.  

3. In an August 2020 letter, VA notified the Veteran that the CRDP compensation award was processed and that VA failed to withhold attorney's fees in the amount of $3,979.68 from the Veteran's retroactive entitlement amount.  VA proposed to recover the amount that should have been paid to his agent and that this action would result in an overpayment. The 20 percent due to the representative from the past-due benefits totaled $3,979.68.

4. VA's failure to make a direct payment to the Veteran's agent did not constitute a reduction or discontinuance of benefits.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The overpayment debt in the amount of $3,979.68 due to retroactive payment of attorney's fees was validly created. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5304(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.654, 3.700.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from January 1969 to July 1970; from March to June 2003 and from March to November 2008.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2021 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Debt Management Center (DMC). 

In the March 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a).

However, in a November 2024 correspondence, the Veteran's former representative withdrew the Veteran's hearing request.  Therefore, the Board finds that there is no outstanding hearing request and will proceed with adjudication of the matter on the merits.  The representative also requested to hold he record open for 90 days. The matter was held in abeyance until the completion of the 90 days.

The validity of debt created due to overpayment in the amount of $3,979.68, as a result of failure to withhold attorney fees from retroactive benefits awarded to the Veteran and whether the overpayment resulted from sole administrative error on the part of the VA without the payee's knowledge that it was erroneous.

The Veteran contends, without specificity, that the overpayment debt in the amount of $3,979.68, which was created as a result of the failure to withhold agent fees from the Veteran's retroactive compensation award is not valid.  See March 2021 VA Form 10182.  For the reasons explained below, the Board finds that the overpayment debt is valid. 

For a determination that the overpayment was not properly created, such that the debt was not valid, it must be established that the claimant was either legally entitled to the benefits in question or, if the claimant was not legally entitled, then it must be shown that VA was solely responsible for the claimant being erroneously paid benefits. Administrative errors include all administrative decisions of entitlement, whether based upon mistake of fact, misunderstanding of controlling regulations or instructions, or misapplication of law. VAOPGPREC 2-90 (July 17, 1989), 55 Fed. Reg. 27757 (1990).

In order for the overpayment to be considered the result of sole administrative error, and for the appellant to consequently not be liable for the debt, the appellant must not have known, or should not have known, that the VA compensation benefits were erroneous. In other words, a finding of sole administrative error requires not only error on the part of VA, but that the beneficiary is unaware that the payments are erroneous. 38 U.S.C. § 5112 (b)(9), (10); 38 C.F.R. § 3.500 (b)(2); Jordan v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 171 (1997) (sole administrative error is not present if the payee knew, or should have known, that the payments were erroneous).

When a claimant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant, the total fee payable to the attorney may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d); 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(1). The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran. See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Jackson v. McDonald, 635 Fed. Appx. 858 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 33 (2019)

In July 2015, the Veteran and his representative entered into a valid fee agreement allowing for direct payment from VA to the representative of 20 percent of a retroactive award of VA benefits.  

In May 2018, VA notified the Veteran that he was entitled to a retroactive CRDP compensation payment of $20,224.69 for the period May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2018.  

In an August 2020 letter, VA notified the Veteran that the CRDP compensation award was processed and that VA failed to withhold attorney's fees in the amount of $3,979.68 from the Veteran's retroactive entitlement amount.  VA proposed to recover the amount that should have been paid to his agent and that this action would result in an overpayment. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the overpayment debt is valid. In that regard, there was an active fee agreement between the Veteran and his previous agent, J.P., for the period in which the Veteran was entitled to the retroactive CRDP compensation payment.  In May 2018, VA issued a retroactive payment for the period in which J.P. was the Veteran's representative.  VA did not withhold the requisite 20 percent from the award and issued the full retroactive amount to the Veteran.  The Veteran's agent was entitled to attorney's fees pursuant to the July 2015 fee agreement. 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636 (h)(1).  The 20 percent due to the representative from the past-due benefits totaled $3,979.68.  Therefore, the overpayment debt in the amount of $3,979.68 was properly created to recoup the amount mistakenly paid to the Veteran, instead of his agent.  

As to any administrative error, the statutory and regulatory provisions pertaining to such error allow for a finding of improper creation only in cases that involve a discontinuation or reduction of benefits (i.e. compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension). 38 U.S.C. § § 5112 (b)(10); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.500 (b)(2). In this case, neither of these types of situation is present, as the Veteran underwent no change in circumstances and VA did not reduce or discontinue any ongoing benefit payment. Instead, VA failed to withhold 20 percent of the single, total lump sum past due benefits payment awarded to the Veteran for the Veteran's agent fees pursuant to a valid fee agreement. Thus, while the VA action was clearly erroneous, the error was not made in relation to any reduction or discontinuance, but merely in relation to a distribution. Consequently, it cannot be construed as the type of action, which would lead to the improper creation of an overpayment. 38 U.S.C. § § 5112 (b)(10); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.500 (b)(2).

Regardless, even assuming arguendo that the erroneous distribution could be construed as involving reduction or discontinuance, the erroneous payment was not due to sole VA administrative error. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5112 (b)(10); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.500 (b)(2). This is so because, having signed the fee agreement, the Veteran was aware or should have been aware, that he was overpaid when he received his past due benefits without the fee withheld.

(continued on the next page)

Accordingly, the Board concludes that the overpayment debt of $3,979.68 is valid, and that the benefit sought on appeal must be denied.
