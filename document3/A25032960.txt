ORDER

Service connection for sleep apnea (also claimed as snoring, daytime drowsiness, difficulty sleeping, night sweats, startle out of sleep) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not perfect a timely appeal of the September 2015 rating decision to the Board, and no good cause has been presented to warrant acceptance of a late filing or a filing of a modernized review system review option.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of service connection for sleep apnea (also claimed as snoring, daytime drowsiness, difficulty sleeping, night sweats, startle out of sleep) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1986 to March 1990 and from June 2000 to November 2003. He also served in the United States Marine Corps from November 1991 to November 1995, from March 1996 to September 1999 and from November 1999 to May 2000. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2015 rating decision from the local VA Regional Office (RO). 

The Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request to the Board in May 2024, and elected the Direct Review option by a Veterans Law Judge. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

The Board notes that evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when such new evidence would not be allowed to be considered. Therefore, the Board may not consider this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran, however, may file a Supplemental Claim at a future date and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, the Board notes that on May 16, 2024, VA sent the Veteran correspondence informing him that his May 2024 10182 was being rejected, as the VA decision that he disagreed with was still in the Legacy (non-modernized system). VA sent the Veteran a letter in October 2024 informing him that records showed that he tried to access the "Request a Board Appeal" page on May 8, 2024, and that if the issues that he attempted to appeal did not appear as listed above he would need to submit a new VA Form 10182. Subsequently, in December 2024 the Veteran submitted a new VA Form 10182, indicating that he disagreed with May 2015 and December 2015 rating decisions, and selected the Direct Review option. In February 2025 VA sent the Veteran a letter informing him that VA could not docket the issues listed in his December 2024 VA Form 10182. However, in March 2025 VA sent the Veteran correspondence stating that the February 2025 letter was sent in error, and that his May 2024 10182 had been docketed. The letter also informed the Veteran that it was possible that after a more detailed review, the Board may determine that the appeal request did not meet necessary procedural requirements, and if so, may issue a decision dismissing the appeal based on such defect. 

1. Service connection for sleep apnea (also claimed as snoring, daytime drowsiness, difficulty sleeping, night sweats, startle out of sleep) is dismissed. 

The Veteran has attempted to file an AMA Notice of Disagreement to the Board in May 2024 as to a legacy rating decision that was issued in September 2015. For the following reasons, this appeal must be dismissed under the AMA. 

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, See Pub. L. No. 115-55, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). This law created a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review under a modernized review system. The AMA automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). Pursuant to the AMA, claimants may elect to review an AMA decision by timely filing a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review request, or Board appeal; or by opting into the modernized review system, following issuance of a Statement of the Case or Supplemental Statement of the Case, by filing for a review option under the new system in accordance with § 3.2500 on a form prescribed by the Secretary within the time allowed for filing a substantive appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500. 

With regard to the filing of a VA Form 10182, Board Appeal, the governing regulation states: "Except . . . for simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision." 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). If good cause is shown, an extension of the period of time for filing a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) may be granted. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c). 

By way of background, the Veteran was initially denied service connection for sleep apnea in a September 2015 rating decision. The Veteran did file a timely notice of disagreement with that rating decision, and an SOC was issued in December 2016. Along with the SOC, VA informed the Veteran that a substantive appeal must be filed within 60 days from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction mailed the Statement of the Case to the appellant, or within the remainder of the 1-year period from the date of mailing of the notification of the determination being appealed, whichever period ends later. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52. The Veteran however did not perfect a timely appeal to the Board. Therefore, that decision became final. 38 U.S.C. §7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103.

On March 28, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, seeking service connection for sleep apnea. In correspondence dated March 30, 2022, VA notified the Veteran that he did not file his request on the proper form. The Veteran was provided instructions on the proper form to use and was informed that no action would be taken until VA received the completed form.

On June 4, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, seeking service connection, in pertinent part, for sleep apnea. In a June 2022 rating decision, the AOJ continued to deny service connection for sleep apnea, on the basis that no new and relevant evidence had been submitted since the September 2015 rating decision. Notice of the Veteran's decision was provided on June 9, 2022. The Veteran was informed that if he did not agree with that decision, he had one year from the date of the letter to appeal the issue and provided him with instructions pertinent to the AMA claims and appeals process. The Veteran did not submit a Notice of Disagreement within the one-year appeal period.

On August 7, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, again seeking service connection for sleep apnea. In correspondence dated October 20, 2023, VA notified the Veteran that he did not file his request on the proper form. The Veteran was provided instructions on the proper form to use and was informed that no action would be taken until VA received the completed form.

In May 2024, the Veteran initiated the present appeal by filing a VA Form 10182, indicating, in pertinent part, that he disagreed with the above-named issue in the September 2015 rating decision. The Board however first finds that as to that rating decision, the May 2024 VA Form 10182 is untimely. Specifically, while the Veteran initially filed a NOD with the September 2015 rating decision, the Veteran did not perfect a timely appeal by filing a VA Form 9 within 60 days of issuance of the December 2016 SOC, and no new and material evidence was received within one year of the September 2015 rating decision. Therefore, the September 2015 rating decision was final. 

Further, the Veteran has filed an AMA review request as to a legacy decision. The AMA became effective February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2. This law creates a new framework for veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review and is applicable to all claims initially decided after that date. 

Here, the rating decision which the Veteran seeks to appeal was issued in September 2015, prior to the implementation of the AMA framework. As the decision on appeal was issued prior to the implementation of the AMA, it must be considered under the legacy system it replaced. The Veteran may opt to have the appeals processed under the AMA, but to do so, must make such election following issuance of a Statement of the Case (SOC) or a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400(c)(2), 19.2(d)(2). The Veteran did not make such an election in this case. 

This case is distinguishable from Hall v. McDonough, 34?Vet. App.?329 (2021). In Hall, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) drew a distinction between questions of jurisdiction (i.e., whether the Board is legally permitted to review a matter), and question of claims processing procedures (i.e., whether deadlines and regulations were properly followed). Id. at 333. The Court concluded that the Board erred in a case where it dismissed an appeal under the AMA when the rating decision sought to be appealed was issued in the legacy appeals system. Id. In other words, the Court concluded that the Board may not dismiss an appeal simply because the Veteran filed an incorrect form when seeking to continue the appellate process. 

In both cases, the claimants filed AMA review requests as to legacy decisions. An important distinction between these two cases, however, is timing. In Hall, the Veteran's 10182 was submitted within one year of the legacy decision he sought to appeal. Id. at 330. In this case, the Veteran submitted his 10182 approximately nine years after the 2015 legacy decision that he sought to appeal was issued to him. 

In Ferko v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?262 (U.S. 2024), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) held the one-year deadline to file a legacy notice of disagreement (NOD) is not a jurisdictional bar to Board review, but a mandatory claims-processing rule. However, this case is distinguishable from Ferko. In Ferko, the Veteran filed his legacy NOD only two weeks after the one-year deadline had expired, and he presented extenuating circumstances as to why his NOD should be accepted. Id. Here, the Veteran filed an AMA NOD to the Board and not the RO, filed it several years after his rating decision was issued, and did not present good cause or extenuating circumstances as to why it could not be filed earlier. 

Assuming arguendo that the May 2024 VA Form 10182 was instead a disagreement with the most recent June 2022 AMA rating decision which denied his claim for service connection for sleep apnea. The Board nonetheless finds that the May 2024 NOD was untimely because at the time of the June 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was provided with instructions pertinent to the AMA claims and appeals process, and informed that he had one year from the date of the letter to appeal the issue, and the Veteran did not file an appeal within the one-year period as instructed.  

As more than one year expired from the date of notification of the September 2015 rating decision, the May 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD was untimely as to the appeal of the denial of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. As the Court noted in Hall v. McDonough, although the Board cannot dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, it may dismiss an appeal for a procedural defect. See Hall v. McDonough, 34?Vet. App.?329 (2021) (the Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction but may consider dismissing it for other non-jurisdictional reasons such as a procedural defect). In this regard, the Veteran's filing of the untimely NOD is a procedural defect, and the Board may dismiss the claim at this time. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.
