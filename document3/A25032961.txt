REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity (LLE) radiculopathy is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 21, 2000, to May 22, 2001, December 2003 until February 2005, and from January 12, 2006, to April 8, 2007.  He was honorably discharged from each period of service.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied LLE radiculopathy secondary to a service-connected back condition. In June 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) requesting the direct review docket with review by a Veterans Law Judge.  Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

By way of background, the April 2024 rating decision denied the Veteran's supplemental claim stating that new and relevant evidence was not received. The Board is not addressing this issue as there was a duty to assist error which predates the Veteran's supplemental claim and requires this claim to be remanded. 

The denial of due process may include issuing a Board decision prior to the expiration of the one-year period for a claimant to request a docket change. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, the Board is not rendering a decision on the merits but remanding the case. Accordingly, the Veteran's due process rights are not affected by not waiting until April 11, 2025, the end of the period in which to request a docket change. 

Entitlement to service connection for LLE radiculopathy is remanded.

The Veteran submitted a September 2011 claim which included a "disc condition" which he contended began while stationed in Iraq in 2006. The June 2013 VA thoracolumbar examination report noted the Veteran had right lower extremity (RLE) radiculopathy. The June 2013 rating decision granted the Veteran service connection for his spine condition and RLE radiculopathy effective September 2011. In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a claim for lower extremity bilateral radiculopathy.  This is the first time the Veteran asserted he had LLE radiculopathy.  In a September 2022 statement to support his claim, the Veteran asserted that his bilateral radiculopathy was secondary to his back condition which resulted in numbness, cramps, and pinprick sensations.  

The October 2022 VA thoracolumbar spine examination report noted that the evaluation was for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy but concluded that the Veteran did not have LLE radiculopathy as there was no objective evidence of LLE radiculopathy. The examiner noted there was objective evidence of moderate pain on palpitation down the Veteran's right leg but did not note whether the left leg had objective evidence of pain. As the left leg was not mentioned with regard to pain, it is unclear whether the examiner examined his left leg for pain. 

The October 2022 examination report noted that both the RLE and LLE had normal reflexes and strength, but noted the RLE lower leg/ankle and foot/toes had decreased sensation. Sensation on the LLE was noted as normal. The report noted the Veteran did not have LLE paresthesias, dysesthesias or numbness.  The examiner did not note the Veteran's September 2022 description of his LLE symptoms, which included numbness, cramps and pinprick sensations or address why the examiner disagreed with the Veteran's lay statement.  The examiner also did not explain the rationale for the opinion that there was no LLE radiculopathy. 

A September 2023 VA thoracolumbar examination found the right knee and ankle had reduced reflexes, and the right knee had decreased sensation to light sensory touch on the right thigh/knee. The right straight leg test was positive. The LLE had normal reflexes, normal sensation, and negative straight leg test. 

The examiner noted that the Veteran had no LLE paresthesias or dysesthesias and no numbness. The Veteran's September 2022 statement noted bilateral numbness, cramps, and pinprick sensations. The examiner did not address whether during the examination the Veteran stated he had no LLE paresthesias, dysesthesias or numbness or whether this was the examiner's conclusion based on the medical examination. If this was the examiner's conclusion based on the medical examination, an explanation of how this conclusion was derived should be included in the examination report.  If the examiner did not agree with the Veteran's statements regarding LLE radiculopathy symptoms, the opinion should also explain why the examiner disagreed with the Veteran's statements and reached a different conclusion. 

Examiners must consider the Veteran's statements and offer a detailed rationale for conclusions. Neither the October 2022 nor the September 2023 examiner addressed the Veteran's lay statements regarding his LLE, nor did they offer an explanation to the extent they disagreed with the Veteran's lay statements.  Accordingly, both opinions are inadequate. 

The VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). Lay testimony is competent to prove that a claimant exhibited certain lay-observable symptoms and the time those symptoms appeared.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  Lay testimony, however, is not competent to determine the diagnosis, extent or etiology of radiculopathy symptoms as such matters require medical expertise to determine. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board notes that the VA has a statutory duty to assist the Veteran that includes the duty to conduct a thorough and contemporaneous examination, so that the rating of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one. Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121 (1991); Snuffer v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 400 (1997). Assistance by VA includes providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on a claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). When the medical evidence is inadequate or incomplete VA must supplement the record by seeking an advisory opinion or ordering another medical examination. Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991); Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 213 (1992).

Accordingly, a remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. These issues are remanded to obtain an examination and adequate medical opinion to directly address the Veteran's LLE radiculopathy symptoms considering his lay statements and the evidence of record.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ is requested to provide this remand to the medical examiner and schedule a new examination to evaluate the Veteran to determine if he has LLE radiculopathy. 

2. The examiner is requested to discuss the Veteran's lay statements regarding LLE radiculopathy symptoms as well as the medical evidence in the new opinion. If the medical examiner does not find that the Veteran's description of his symptoms is accurate, the examiner is requested to explain the rationale for such disagreement.

3. If the examiner finds that the Veteran does not have LLE radiculopathy, the examiner is requested to provide a detailed explanation for this finding and to explain the medical principles for this conclusion.
