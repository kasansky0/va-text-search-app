ORDER

The appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a September 2023 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied entitlement to service connection for hypertension.

2. The October 2024 VA Form 10182 listing the September 2023 rating decision was untimely and good cause to grant an extension for the filing is not shown.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to entitlement to service connection for hypertension are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1971 to August 1973.  He appeals a September 2023 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denying service connection for hypertension.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

An appeal of a decision by the AOJ consists of a Notice of Disagreement submitted to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.201.  A claimant must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If a Notice of Disagreement is not filed within the one-year period, the decision becomes final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(d)(2), 20.1103.

If the Veteran submits an untimely VA Form 10182 or submits an incorrect form to appeal a given rating decision, the Board may dismiss the appeal due a procedural defect, where the claimant did not substantially comply with proper claims processing rules.  See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (stating VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings); see also Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021).

On the October 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran listed the "2023-09-06" rating decision as the "Date of Decision" on appeal.  See October 2024 VA Form 10182.  As October 2024 is more than a year after September 2023, the Board finds the appeal is untimely.

The Veteran did not file a motion for an extension, has not provided good cause to extend the filing period, and no other arguable waiver is applicable here.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).

Based on the foregoing, as no good cause has been shown and no waiver was made as to the October 2024 VA Form 10182, the October 2024 VA Form 10182 was, and remains, untimely.  As a result, the appeal is dismissed.
