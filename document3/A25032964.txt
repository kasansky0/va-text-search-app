ORDER

Entitlement to payment of retroactive educational assistance under the Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) provisions of Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (known as the Post-9/11 GI Bill), effective July 25, 2018, and no earlier, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Appellant submitted an application for Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits on July 25, 2019. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to payment of retroactive educational assistance benefits effective July 25, 2018, and no earlier, under the Post-9/11 GI Bill have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 3031; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.1029 (b)(2), 21.7131(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1983 to May 1983 and from November 1995 to July 2016. The Appellant is the Veteran's daughter, whom education benefits under Chapter 33 have successfully been transferred. 

The administrative decision on appeal was issued in March 2020 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the May 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on January 25, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to payment of retroactive VA educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33, Title 38, United States Code (Post-9/11 GI Bill) effective July 25, 2018

The Appellant contends that her use of transferred benefits under Chapter 33 should be effective as early as January 25, 2016, the date she began her education at University of Maryland College Park. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran successfully transferred part of his Chapter 33 benefits to the Appellant in October 2010. This is the date that the Department of Defense approved the Veteran's transfer request.

The evidence of record shows that the Appellant submitted the Application for Family Member to Use Transferred Benefits (VA Form 22-1990E) and dated the form October 30, 2018. Specifically, it was indicated that the Appellant was seeking to use her transferred Chapter 33 benefits at University of Maryland College Park as early as January 25, 2016, towards a bachelor's in science. However, this Application was not received by VA until July 25, 2019, as noted by the time stamp on the Applicant's application. 

Notably, the law provides that when an eligible individual enters into training, the commencing date of the award of educational assistance for the program of education the service member is pursuing, is the latest of: (1) the date of certification of the educational institution; (2) one year before the date of claim; (3) the effective date of the approval of the course; or (4) one year before the date VA receives approval notice. 38 C.F.R. § 21.7131 (a)(1)(i)(A)-(D). For purposes of determining the commencing date of an award of that educational assistance, the "date of claim" is the date on which a valid claim or application for educational assistance benefits is considered to have been filed with VA. 38 C.F.R. § 21.1029 (b). If an informal claim is filed and VA receives a formal claim within one year of the date VA requested it, the date of claim is the date VA received the informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 21.1029 (b)(1). If a formal claim is filed (other than previously described), the date of claim is the date VA received the formal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 21.1029 (b)(2). If a formal claim itself is abandoned and a new formal or informal claim is filed, the date of claim is as provided for above, as appropriate. 38 C.F.R. § 21.1029 (b)(3).

As noted, the Appellant's VA Form 22-1990 was received by VA on July 25, 2019, One year before the date of the earliest indication of a claim is July 25, 2018. The record does not contain any other earlier documentation, prior to July 25, 2019, that could be reasonably construed as an informal claim for VA educational assistance benefits. See 38 C.F.R. § 21.1029 (b). 

The Board points out that the Veteran is seeking reimbursement of educational expenses incurred while attending the University of Maryland College Park as early as January 25, 2016, which is well more than one year before the date VA received the Appellant's claim for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. 

Therefore, the claim for retroactive payment of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits for expenses incurred while studying at the University of Maryland College Park is granted in part. Specifically, retroactive payment of Chapter 33 educational assistance is granted effective July 25, 2018, and no earlier.

Unfortunately, there is no provision that allows for payment of benefits more than one-year prior to the date of claim, even if a claimant was unaware of his/her potential eligibility to use such benefits at an earlier date. Thus, entitlement to retroactive educational assistance beginning July 25, 2019, and no earlier, is granted.
