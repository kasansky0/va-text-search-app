FINDING OF FACT

In January 2025, the Veteran died while the appeals were pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for hemorrhoids, including an earlier effective date prior to May 31, 2022, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

2. Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to April 19, 2022, for the 10 percent rating assigned for hemorrhoids have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1969 to June 1971.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeals. A January 2025 Social Security Administration inquiry confirms that the Veteran passed away in January 2025. See also February 2023 VA 40-1330 Application for Government Headstone or Marker (confirming January 18, 2025, as date of death). Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claims at this time and must dismiss the appeals. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b).  Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the Veteran, yet. Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant."  The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/.  If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the Veteran's death and then grants the request, these dismissed appeals will resume its place on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).
