DOCKET NO. 240425-435465
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has tinnitus; the evidence as to whether the disability is related to his active service is at least in equipoise.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for an award of service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from April 1991 to September 1996. His decorations include the Southwest Asia Service Medal.

The rating decision underlying the present appeal was entered in October 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. Following a denial on Higher-Level Review in April 2024, the Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) later that month, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the October 2023 AOJ rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

As a final introductory matter, the Board notes that service connection for tinnitus was previously denied in a September 2019 rating decision. In the October 2023 decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been presented or secured to warrant readjudication of the claim. The Board is bound by that favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801(a).

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus 

The Veteran seeks to establish service connection for tinnitus. He believes that the disability can be attributed to his exposure to noise in service as a result of his job as an aircraft mechanic.

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

If a Veteran serves 90 days or more of active, continuous service after December 31, 1946, and manifests certain chronic diseases-including organic diseases of the nervous system-to a degree of 10 percent or more during the one-year period following his separation from that service, service connection for the condition may be established on a presumptive basis, notwithstanding that there is no in-service record of the disorder. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Service connection may also be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) by (a) evidence of (i) a chronic disease shown as such in service (or within an applicable presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307) and (ii) subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease, or (b) if the fact of chronicity in service in not adequately supported, by evidence of continuity of symptomatology. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) relating to continuity of symptomatology can be applied only in cases involving those conditions explicitly recognized as chronic under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that tinnitus is a disease, rather than merely a symptom, and that 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) "includes tinnitus, at a minimum where there is evidence of acoustic trauma, as an 'organic disease[] of the nervous system.'" Moreover, the Court indicated that, as such a presumptive condition, tinnitus warrants consideration of the continuity of symptomatology provisions found at 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).

A layperson is generally incapable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007). However, lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when: (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition (e.g., a broken leg, separated shoulder, pes planus (flat feet), varicose veins, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), etc.), (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In essence, lay testimony is competent when it pertains to the readily observable features or symptoms of injury or illness and "may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection." Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). A determination as to whether medical evidence is needed to demonstrate that a Veteran presently has the same condition he or she had in service or during a presumptive period, or whether lay evidence will suffice, depends on the nature of the Veteran's present condition (e.g., whether the Veteran's present condition is of a type that requires medical expertise to identify it as the same condition as that in service or during a presumption period, or whether it can be so identified by lay observation). See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 310 (2007).

Thus, medical evidence is not always or categorically required when the determinative issue involves either medical diagnosis or etiology, but rather such issue may, depending on the facts of the particular case, be established by competent and credible lay evidence under 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). See Davidson, supra. 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. §5107; 38 C.F.R. §3.102. An approximate balance of the evidence includes, but is not limited to, equipoise. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Evidence is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Id.

In the present case, there is no material dispute that the Veteran has tinnitus. In the rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made a favorable finding to that effect. That favorable finding is binding on the Board and is not in dispute. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The first element of service connection, as to the presence of a current disability, has therefore been established.

Nor is there any material dispute that the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise during service. In the rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made a favorable finding that his military occupational specialty of aerospace maintenance journeyman had a high probability for hazardous noise exposure. That favorable finding is also binding on the Board and is not in dispute. The second element of service connection, as to an in-service event, injury, or disease, has therefore also been established. 

As to the nexus, or link, between the Veteran's tinnitus and his conceded in-service exposure to hazardous noise, he is competent to provide statements with respect to the onset and presence of tinnitus, inasmuch as such symptoms are observable by a lay person. During a September 2019 VA examination, he reported having tinnitus for 20 to 30 years. At a February 2022 private wellness examination, he reported struggling with tinnitus since being in the military. Additionally, during an August 2023 private audiology visit, he reported that he felt that his tinnitus began during his military service. The Board finds that the Veteran's statements with respect to onset in service are credible.

The Board acknowledges that the VA audiologist who evaluated the Veteran in September 2019 offered an unfavorable opinion with respect to nexus. The Board notes, however, that it does not appear that the examiner gave adequate consideration to the Veteran's reported history of tinnitus going back 20 to 30 years, all the way back to service. As detailed above, he is competent as a lay person to provide such a history.

On balance, and taking into account the totality of the evidence-including the Veteran's conceded in-service noise exposure and his statements with respect to onset of symptoms-the Board is persuaded that the criteria for an award of service connection for tinnitus have been met. The evidence, at a minimum, gives rise to a reasonable doubt on the matter. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The appeal is granted.
