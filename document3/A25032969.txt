DOCKET NO. 240326-427286
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the February 2024 denial of a disability evaluation greater than 50 percent for a service-connected psychiatric disorder ("generalized anxiety disorder (PTSD) (claimed with insomnia)") is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In September 2024, the Veteran notified the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) that he intends to withdraw his appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to withdraw the appeal of the February 2024 denial of a disability evaluation greater than 50 percent for a service-connected psychiatric disorder ("generalized anxiety disorder (PTSD) (claimed with insomnia)") have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from August 1997 to March 2018.

This matter is on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision by a VA Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182 or "NOD") and selected the hearing docket. 

In a September 2024 statement (before his hearing was scheduled), the Veteran explicitly and unambiguously indicated that he wished to withdraw his appeal as to the issue of entitlement to a disability evaluation greater than 50 percent for his service-connected psychiatric disorder. The Board does not have jurisdiction to review the issue and the appeal is dismissed. See 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.
