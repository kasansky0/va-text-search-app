ORDER

Service connection for bilateral eye disabilities, to include open angle glaucoma and legal blindness, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's bilateral eye disability, to include open angle glaucoma and legal blindness, is related to an in-service event.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral eye disabilities have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from June 1979 to January 1986.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral eye disabilities is granted.

The Veteran generally contends that his bilateral eye disabilities are related to his service. See Veteran's statement, received October 15, 2021. 

In the April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that new and relevant evidence had been submitted. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). As such, the Board will not address the issue of whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim and acknowledges a favorable finding that sufficient new and relevant evidence is of record to proceed to the merits of the issue.  

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In the April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ also made favorable findings by which the Board is bound that the Veteran has a diagnosis of bilateral glaucoma, and that he complained of and/or was treated for not being able to see and needing glasses in September 1980. These favorable findings satisfy elements one and two of service connection. Regarding a current diagnosis, the Board also finds that the evidence reflects diagnoses of legal blindness due to open angle glaucoma.

Thus, the question is whether the Veteran's current bilateral eye disabilities are related to service. On this question there are probative opinions in favor of and against the claim. 

The evidence against the claim includes a March 2022 VA addendum opinion in which the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's current bilateral glaucoma disability was less likely than not incurred or caused by an in-service event. In support of the opinion, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's recurrent eyelid swelling noted in his service treatment records sounded like a type of allergy and the Veteran was diagnosed with exophoria which is likely to have caused him to have trouble reading. Lastly, the VA examiner explained open angle glaucoma symptoms are silent, which is the reason most glaucoma progresses before a problem is identified; the America Academy of Ophthalmology does not mention trouble with nighttime vision as a symptom of glaucoma. 

The evidence in favor of the claim includes an October 2021 opinion from the Veteran's VA treating optometrist in which the optometrist opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's bilateral glaucoma disability is related to his military service. The optometrist also opined that the Veteran was legally blind due to open angle glaucoma. In support of the opinion, the VA optometrist noted that the combination of the Veteran's history of night vision loss and how quickly he was diagnosed with glaucoma once seeing a medical professional supports a nexus. Additionally, the optometrist stated that open angle glaucoma even untreated progresses somewhat slowly and the level of vision loss when the Veteran was finally diagnosed suggests that glaucoma had started years ago while on active duty. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds these opinions to be entitled to equal weight of probative value. As such, the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current bilateral glaucoma disability is related to his service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for bilateral eye disabilities, to include open angle glaucoma and legal blindness, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
