ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for a genitourinary disorder  is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In June 2023, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) received written notice from the Veteran requesting a withdrawal of his appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for a genitourinary disorder.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for a genitourinary disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

?

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1969 to February 1971, February 1971 to November 1975, and November 1976 to February 1981.

The present appeal arises from an August 2022 supplemental claim rating decision which determined new and relevant evidence had not been received. The Veteran appealed that decision by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in December 2022. He elected the Evidence docket. The appeal was assigned docket number 221202-303477.

Entitlement to service connection for a genitourinary disorder.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific errors of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

The requirements for making a written withdrawal of an appeal are set out in 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. By regulation, a veteran's "appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal." 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(a). To be effective, the "withdrawal[] must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf)." 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1). The withdrawal must also include "the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn." 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1). Furthermore, "if the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety, or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal." 38 C.F.R. §20.205(b)(1).

When deciding whether a withdrawal is valid, the Board should ordinarily confine itself to examining the written submission to determine whether it complies with the requirements laid out in the regulation. See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2020). If the withdrawal includes the name of the veteran, the file number, and unambiguously identifies the claim(s) to be withdrawn, the written withdrawal will be considered valid, and the Board need not look to other evidence to find it so. Id.

On June 21, 2023, the Veteran submitted a written statement, dated June 12, 2023, in which he indicated that he wished to withdraw his appeal for entitlement to service connection for a genitourinary disorder, which also identified by the docket number 221202-303477.  This written statement also included the Veteran's name and VA file number, and it was signed by the Veteran. The statement also clearly and unambiguously indicated the intent/request to withdraw the appeal seeking service connection for a genitourinary disorder.

Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal as to entitlement a service connection for a genitourinary condition is withdrawn. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
