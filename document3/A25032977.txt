ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and unspecified depressive disorder, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, he has an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD AUD, MDD, and unspecified depressive disorder, that is at least as likely as not related to a traumatic stressor event that occurred during active military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, AUD, MDD, and unspecified depressive disorder, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1988 to December 1992. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2024 decision. In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2024 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 decision. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

In determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the Veteran's description of the claim, symptoms described, and the information submitted or developed in support of the claim. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). 

In light of the decision in Clemons and the diagnoses of record, the Board has expanded the Veteran's claim to include acquired psychiatric disorders and the issue has been recharacterized as stated on the title page. This will provide the most favorable review of the Veteran's claims in keeping with the holding in Clemons. 

Service Connection

Generally, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, Naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Typically, this requires (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. See Shedden v. Principi,381 F.3d 1163, 1167(Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the disability in accordance with the DSM-V for claims certified on or after August 4, 2014; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus or link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f), 4.125(a). The Board notes that this present appeal comes to the Board from a March 2024 rating decision, derived from a May 2022 initial claim, therefore the DSM-V criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD applies.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. §5107; 38 C.F.R. §3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski,1 Vet. App. 49(1990).

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and unspecified depressive disorder, is granted.

The Veteran contends that he has an acquired psychiatric disability that is related to traumatic events during his active military service. 

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current acquired psychiatric disorder disability, to include PTSD, AUD, MDD, and unspecified depressive disorder, that is related to an in-service stressor event during his active duty Naval service while stationed in Guam. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. §3.303(a), 3.304.

Evidence

The Veteran's military personnel records (MPRs) reveal that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was "orthopedic cast room technician," other MPRs described him as "hospital corpsman," and that he was stationed at the Naval hospital in Guam from June 1990 through April 1992. See VBMS document titled, "Military Personnel Record," receipt date 01/14/2022.

The Veteran's file lacks any evidence of service treatment records (STRs). The AOJ made three requests for the Veteran's STRs from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) on June 24, 2022, July 24, 2022, and January 5, 2023. The Veteran's file includes an August 2022 subsequent development letter, a September 2022 "Final Attempt Letter," and a December 2022 'Final Attempt Letter." In the December 2022 "Final Attempt Letter," the AOJ informed the Veteran that the NPRC was unable to locate his STRs and that further attempts to obtain them would be futile. See VBMS document titled, "Final Attempt," receipt date 12/15/2022. 

In May 2022, the Veteran submitted his initial claim, two lay statements, and a May 2022 private examination and opinion. In the Veteran's May 2022 lay statements, he identified K.S., as an airman killed by a grenade during a training exercise in Guam and for whom the Veteran treated during multiple surgeries over several days, in effort to save her life. The Veteran also identified a second stressor event related to his service in Guam, where an unnamed Marine was brought into the hospital with significant burn injuries from which he died. See VBMS document titled, "VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim," receipt date 05/27/2022; VBMS document titled, "21-0781, Statement in Support of Claim for PTSD," receipt date 05/27/2022.

The May 2022 private examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD according to the DSM-V. The private examiner identified only one stressor event, the death of the airman during the training exercise in Guam, as described in the Veteran's lay statements. The private examination report includes detailed descriptions of the Veteran's mental health history, legal history, and occupational history as well as specific symptoms and experiences since the stressor event. See VBMS document titled, "Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility," receipt date 05/27/2022.

In June 2022, the Veteran's Benefits Administration, Office of Field Operations, Military Records Research Center (MRRC) completed research on the claimed stressor event, concluding that Airman K.S. died following an automobile accident in Texas. See VBMS document titled, "Records Research Center Response," receipt date 06/24/2022. In response, the AOJ notified the Veteran that more information was required to verify the claimed stressor event. The notification letter did not inform the Veteran that the MRRC had determined the name of the reported Airman did not match the circumstances of his claimed stressor. See VBMS document titled, "Subsequent Development Letter," receipt date 10/04/2022.

The Veteran's record reveals back and forth communications between the AOJ, the MRRC, and Veteran between October 2022 and February 2023. In response to the AOJ's October 2022 and December 2022 notifications of failure to verify the stressors, the Veteran resubmitted the stressor statement in October 2022, December 2022, and January 2023. At no point did the AOJ inform the Veteran of the June 2022 MRRC response indicating he had provided an incorrect name for the deceased airman.

The Veteran was afforded the first of three VA examinations in September 2022. The September 2022 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD, AUD, and MDD in accordance with the DSM-V. The examiner found that it is not possible to differentiate the symptoms between diagnoses because they "frequently overlap and aggravate each other." In support of the Veteran's PTSD diagnosis, the examiner identified only one stressor that contributed to the Veteran's PTSD. The stressor is the same event described in the Veteran's May 2022 lay statements and identified by the May 2022 private examiner. The September 2022 VA examiner noted relevant evidence including the Veteran's DD-214 indicating MOS and medals as "E-4; Orthopedic Cast Room Tech; GCM, Overseas Service Ribbon, NDSM," enlistment examination "without psychiatric issues," and the Veteran's statement in support of claim. The September 2022 examination report does not identify any other stressors and attributes all symptoms to the diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorders. See VBMS document titled, "C&P Exam," receipt date 09/22/2022 (DBQ). In a corresponding medical nexus opinion, the September 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder disability is at least as likely as not related to the Veteran's claimed in-service event, injury, or illness. The rationale was that the Veteran's diagnoses are supported by his statement and description of the in-service stressor event, reports of self-medicating with alcohol, MOS, and lack of history of mental illness prior to enlistment. See VBMS document titled, "C&P Exam" receipt date 09/22/2022 (opinion). 

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a news article/obituary that identifies L.L. as a young Airman who was killed in an August 1991 accident while stationed in Guam. The news article/obituary details her traumatic injuries and explains that she died four days after a training accident. The article included significant details of the horrific injuries that led to her death, as well as the circumstances of the training exercise and accident. See VBMS document titled, "Correspondence," receipt date 06/29/2023. The details of the news article/obituary are consistent with the Veteran's description in his May 2022 lay statements and the May 2022 and September 2022 examination reports, with the exception of the name of the airman and the date of the event.

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a buddy statement from, LCDR J.O., a friend who the Veteran met during his Naval service. LCDR J.O. explains that during their Naval service, the Veteran mentored him and instructed him in techniques related to orthopedic surgical casting, that the Veteran was "a model Sailor who imparted a commitment to excellence coupled with an outstanding attitude and calm demeanor." LCDR J.O. described reconnecting with the Veteran after discharge from Naval service and he noted "an apparent change in his general demeanor and attitude...multiple changes in his employment status...multiple family challenges after coming back off active-duty," and that the Veteran shared that he had been exposed to "extremely traumatic and extreme situations in particular one situation that resulted in the death of a service member which had resulted during one of the military exercises." LCDR J.O. added that it is his opinion that the Veteran was not the same person he served with while on active duty in the case of his mental health. See VBMS document titled, "Buddy/Lay Statement," receipt date 06/29/2023.

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted private treatment records revealing mental health therapy from October 2022 through June 2023. The records reflect diagnoses of PTSD, depression, and anxiety as well as treatment and medication management for his acquired psychiatric disorder disability. An October 2022 record includes a summary of the Veteran's reported stressor as, "I was a corpsman and ortho assistant surgery. I was trained in Combat, we were doing a special operation, a medic blown up her leg (sic)." See VBMS document titled, "Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility," receipt date 07/26/2023. 

The Veteran was afforded his second of three VA examinations in August 2023. The August 2023 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with unspecified depressive disorder and AUD but declined to diagnose the Veteran with PTSD. The examiner also found "no criterion met," in every single category of the PTSD diagnostic table. The examiner explained the lack of PTSD diagnosis stating that the Veteran's "claimed stressors are unconfirmed, as noted in the 03/15/2012 rating decision narrative, and given that there is no substantiating marker evidence present in the Veteran's available records...under C&P diagnostic standards, DSM PTSD diagnostic criteria A cannot be considered met and therefore the Veteran cannot be assigned the diagnosis of PTSD for his claimed military traumas." The examiner then opined that based on the "available STRs," "there is no evidence that the Veteran was diagnosed or treated for mental disorders, trauma-related or otherwise," during his Naval service, that his performance reviews indicate exclusively good performance throughout his service, and that there is no "marker evidence or mental disorder diagnoses in the years immediately following his discharge from active-duty service." The examiner then opined that the prior VA examiner and a private examiner who rendered diagnoses of PTSD, "were acting in the capacity of clinicians and, as such, they may approach the diagnostic process and diagnostic decisions differently than forensic Examiners in C&P. Clinicians can be and often are more liberal when assigning diagnoses and may not uphold the more stringent standards required of C&P Examiners, particularly in regard to PTSD Criteria A." The August 2023 VA examiner then concluded as to the Veteran's "other [mental health] diagnoses," that there is no evidence "in the Veteran's available STRs" of the Veteran being diagnosed with these or any other Mental Disorders during his military service, or the years immediately following his discharge from service, these conditions cannot be considered to have resulted from events or conditions the veteran may have encountered during his military service." See VBMS document titled, "C&P Exam," receipt date 08/03/2023. 

In October 2023, the AOJ obtained and associated with the Veteran's file, an Official Military Activities Report (OMAR). OMAR is a VBA research tool that aggregates several approved data sources for stressor verification. The October 2023 OMAR casualties report confirmed the death of Airman L.L., on August 20, 1991, due to accident.  See VBMS document titled, "Web/HTML Documents," receipt date 10/03/2023. 

The AOJ immediately requested a new VA examination and opinion and under "potentially relevant evidence," for the examiner to review, identified the OMAR as "stressor verified." See VBMS document titled, "VA 21-2507a Request for Physical Examination," receipt date 10/03/2023.

The Veteran was afforded his third of three VA examinations in November 2023. The November 2023 VA examiner prepared two separate disability benefits questionnaires (DBQs), one for PTSD, and one for mental disorders other than PTSD. At the very beginning of both DBQs, the November 2023 VA examiner made a notation that "the Veteran's most recent C&P exam is dated 8/3/2023. He stated there have been 'no changes since the last exam' and that he maintains the traumatic events reported at that time, but rather the VBA received a new document(s) that was submitted as evidence. As the Veteran maintained there were no changes in any area of the exam, to include symptoms, social and occupational impairment, SI/HI, intent or plan, the Veteran was asked to review the exam for any areas he felt were deficient. The Veteran stated he did not have any            additional information to add since his last exam, so all information noted on Aug 3, 2023, was reviewed and remains the same at this time." The examiner further indicated that "Documents in Virtual VA and the veteran's electronic folder (E-File) in VBMS were reviewed. All new evidence/documents submitted since last exam reviewed." Both of the November 2023 DBQs and corresponding opinion are verbatim copies of the August 2023 VA examination report and opinion. There is no indication that the November 2023 VA examiner considered or incorporated any evidence, to include the OMAR, news article/obituary, or buddy statement that were specifically tabbed for review in the October 2023 AOJ request for new examination and opinion. See VBMS documents titled, "C&P Exam," receipt date 11/20/2023 (two DBQs and one opinion); see also VBMS document titled, "VA 21-2507a Request for Physical Examination," receipt date 10/03/2023.

In December 2023, the AOJ requested an addendum opinion from the November VA examiner and specifically requested that she review and address the October 2023 OMAR evidence that confirmed the death of Airman, L.L., and which was not considered in the November 2023 opinion. See VBMS document titled, "CAPRI," receipt date 12/01/2023.

In the December 2023 addendum opinion, the same November 2023 examiner opined that, "there is no contention by this examiner regarding the confirmed stressor, rather as indicated on the last exam the evidence provided does not support a [diagnosis] of PTSD or any other [mental health] condition related to the claimed in service stressor. Though an individual may be exposed to a traumatic event, not everyone develops Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Each person is unique in their ability to manage fear, stress and the threat posed by a traumatic event or situation. It is certainly possible that the Veteran experienced some symptoms related to exposure to this event at the that time, but there is no evidence of any diagnosis, signs/symptoms or conditions of PTSD or any other [mental health] conditions during [active duty] service, within one year of [discharge] of [active duty] service or for decades following [discharge] from [active duty] service." The examiner then again copied the August 2023 opinion verbatim. See VBMS documents titled, "C&P Exam," receipt date 12/14/2023 (addendum opinion).

In addition to evidence, the Veteran's representative has submitted arguments imploring VA to grant his client's claim. See VBMS document titled, "VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application," receipt date 06/29/2023; see also VBMS document titled, "VA form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review," receipt date 06/06/2024. The Board has thoroughly reviewed the arguments submitted by the representative. 

Analysis

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder is related to the traumatic events he experienced during service.

First, the Board finds that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed disability of PTSD in accordance with the DSM-V. The May 2022 private examination report and September 2022 VA examination report reveal that the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD in accordance with the DSM-V criteria prior to the rating decision on appeal. 

Second, the Board finds that the October 2023 OMAR casualties report constitutes credible supporting evidence because it was procured by the AOJ using approved methods to access significant activity data for stressor verification. The Board also finds that the June 2023 news article/obituary constitutes credible supporting evidence because it was created by a third-party source with no evidence of relationship to the Veteran, and its information expressly corresponds to the October 2023 OMAR verified casualties report. The Board further finds that the Veteran's MPRs constitute objective evidence of the Veteran's MOS as a hospital corpsman or orthopedic cast room technician, and his duty location at the Naval hospital in Guam from June 1990 through April 1992. 

Third, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that the May 2022 private opinion and the September 2022 VA examination report and opinion constitute medical evidence of a nexus or link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. Both the May 2022 private opinion and September 2022 VA examination report identified the same in-service stressor as verified by the OMAR casualty report and described in the news article/obituary and neither report attributes the Veteran's symptoms to any other stressor or traumatic event. 

In addition, the May 2022 and September 2022 examination reports include extensive prior, during, and post-service history, are internally consistent, and the DSM-V PTSD diagnosis includes descriptions of the in-service stressor that are consistent with the OMAR casualty report, news article/obituary, and the Veteran's MPRs. The September 2022 VA examiner also noted that the Veteran was "cooperative and... describe military stressors in vivid emotional details." Neither examination report gave any indication that the Veteran's reported history of symptoms and stressful events were inconsistent or contrived. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.2; see also Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999) (an examination report must, among other things, provide an adequate rationale to support an understanding of the conclusion contained therein). Despite restating the incorrect dates of stressors as reported by the Veteran, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that the August 2023 VA examination report includes an adequate rationale to support the DSM-V diagnosis of PTSD. 

In contrast, the Board finds that the August 2023, November 2023, and December 2023 VA examination reports and opinions are inadequate because they failed to consider and incorporate credible supporting evidence of record, namely the OMAR report, news article/obituary, and the Veteran's relevant MPRs. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (Inadequate medical examinations include examinations that provide unsupported conclusions). The November 2023 VA examiner even acknowledged that new evidence was added to the Veteran's file since the August 2023 examination, yet did not address or incorporate the OMAR casualty report into either the November 2023 VA examination report and opinion or the December 2023 addendum opinion. 

The Board further finds that the August 2023, November 2023, and December 2023 examination reports and opinions are inadequate and based on an inaccurate factual premise because they improperly rely on the absence of evidence as negative evidence. Lack of evidence cannot be treated as substantive negative evidence. In other words, reliance on the lack of medical evidence, especially without consideration of lay statements, is an inadequate rationale. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) has held that the mere absence of evidence does not equate to unfavorable evidence. See Forshey v. Principi, 284 F.3d 1335, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (en banc) (cautioning that negative evidence, meaning actual evidence weighing against a party, must not be equated with the absence of substantive evidence); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007) (holding that an examination must consider lay evidence of in-service incurrence or continuity of symptomatology since service). The examiners expressly rely on "available STRs" and repeatedly found that there is no evidence of record that the Veteran sought mental health care during active Naval service. Moreover, the August 2023 and November 2023 examiners neglected to consider the Veteran's express report to the September 2022 VA examiner that, while on active duty, he sought mental health care and was treated for symptoms of acquired psychiatric disorders from the Navy providers. Accordingly, the Board finds that the August 2023, November 2023, and December 2023 examination reports and opinions are inadequate and based on an inaccurate factual premise because they improperly relied on the absence of STRs as negative evidence and failed to consider the Veteran's lay report regarding in-service mental health care. 

Furthermore, the Board finds that the August 2023 and November 2023 opinions are conclusory and supported by no evidence as to the opinion that the May 2022 and September 2022 examination reports and opinions are entitled to less weight than their own. The August 2023 and November 2023 examiner's opinion that the May 2022 and September 2022 examiners were "acting in the capacity of clinicians," is not supported by evidence of record and entitled to no probative weight. The August 2023 and November 2023 examiners explained their opinion stating that clinicians are "more liberal" when assigning diagnoses because applying "more stringent standards required of C&P Examiners, "runs a risk of alienating a potential patient and undermining or eliminating the possibility of developing a therapeutic relationship." There is no evidence that either the May 2022 private examiner, or the September 2022 VA examiner were acting in any capacity other than as expert witnesses. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) ("Both VA medical examiners and private physicians offering medical opinions in veterans benefits cases are nothing more or less than expert witnesses."). See also Sickles v. Shinseki, 643 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (noting that, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, VA medical examiners are presumed competent). The August 2023 and November 2023 VA examiners cited no evidence to support their conclusory opinion that the May 2022 and September 2022 examiners were unqualified or less qualified to render medical nexus opinions. Accordingly, the Board finds that the August 2023 and November 2023 opinion as to the capacity and qualifications of the May 2022 and September 2022 examiners is conclusory and entitled to no probative weight.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the August 2023, November 2023, and December 2023 VA examination reports and opinions are unsupported by reasoned explanation that incorporates credible supporting evidence of record. A medical opinion that is unsupported and unexplained is purely speculative and does not provide the degree of certainty required for medical nexus evidence. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); see also See Miller v. West, 11 Vet. App. 345, 348(1998) (medical opinions must be supported by clinical findings in the record; bare conclusions, even those made by medical professionals, which are not accompanied by a factual predicate in the record, are not probative medical opinions). As such, the Board finds that the May 2022 and September 2022 examination reports and opinions are more probative of whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD that is related to the claimed in-service stressor.  

Therefore, the Board finds that the May 2022 and September 2022 examination reports and opinions constitute medical evidence of a nexus or link between the Veteran's current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304(f), 4.125; Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, MDD, AUD, and unspecified depressive disorder. The appeal is granted. 38 U.S.C. §5107; 38 C.F.R. §3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski,1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
