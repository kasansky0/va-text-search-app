FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left knee osteoarthritis with limitation of flexion is manifested by painful and limited range of motion, but it does not more closely approximate flexion limited to 30 degrees or less.

2. The Veteran's right knee osteoarthritis with limitation of flexion is manifested by painful and limited range of motion, but it does not more closely approximate flexion limited to 30 degrees or less.

3. The Veteran's LLE sciatic nerve does not more closely approximate moderately severe incomplete paralysis

4. The Veteran's RLE sciatic nerve does not more closely approximate moderately severe incomplete paralysis

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for left knee osteoarthritis limitation of flexion have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

2. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee osteoarthritis limitation of flexion have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent from for LLE radiculopathy sciatic nerve have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

4. The criteria for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent from for RLE radiculopathy sciatic nerve have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1987 to August 1991 and from June 2006 to November 2007, and with additional Reserve service. The Veteran has a combined rating of 100 percent effective from November 11, 2022. See Rating Decision Codesheet (August 2024). 

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) and requested review of a February 15, 2023, rating decision denying higher ratings for bilateral knee osteoarthritis limitation of flexion and bilateral lower extremity (BLE) sciatic nerves. On December 20, 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 15, 2023, decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 15, 2023, decision. 

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 15, 2023, rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Lastly, a claim for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) has not been raised by the record. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Here, the Veteran has not asserted TDIU, and the evidence of record has not raised TDIU. See VA 21-4138 (November 2022) (Veteran reports being full-time employed). The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

Evaluations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous."  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time.  Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings).  When adjudicating a claim for an increased initial evaluation, the relevant time period is from the date of the claim.  Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 215 (2007), rev'd in irrelevant part, Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (2009).  When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed.  Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has not been afforded with VA examinations in conjunction with his claims for increased ratings as he submitted disability benefit questionnaires (DBQ) reports, completed by a private physician, concerning these issues and requested his claims be adjudicated without a VA examination. See VA 21-526EZ (November 2022); VA Examination (November 2022). VA has a duty to assist claimants in the development of their claims includes obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Here, the record contains the Veteran-submitted DBQ reports, received in November 2022, which contain sufficient information for evaluating the severity of his bilateral knee and BLE radiculopathy and are adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). Given the adequacy of the DBQ reports along with the Veteran's expressed desire to proceed with adjudication without be provided VA examinations, the Board finds there is no pre-decisional duty to assist error to warrant a remand for new VA examination. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee osteoarthritis with limitation of flexion. 

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee osteoarthritis with limitation of flexion. 

A July 2014 rating decision awarded service connection for left and right knee osteoarthritis with limitation of flexion (left and right knee disabilities) and assigned 10 percent rating each pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260, effective from November 17, 2012. See Rating Decision (July 2014). On November 29, 2022, VA received the Veteran's formal application for increased ratings for left and right knee disabilities, which were denied in a February 15, 2023, rating decision. See VA Form 21-526 (November 2022); Rating Decision (February 2023). The Veteran has appealed the denial of higher ratings for left and right knee osteoarthritis limitation of flexion. See VA Form 20-0996 (August 2023); VA Form 10182 (January 2024). 

The relevant rating review period begins November 29, 2022, the date of the claim for increase ratings with one year look back, and ends on February 15, 2023, the date of the rating decision subject to the HLR rating decision on appeal.  

The Board concludes that that the most persuasive evidence of record weighs against rating in excess of 10 percent each for left and right knee osteoarthritis limitation of flexion. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5260 provides that flexion of the leg limited to 60 degrees is rated as noncompensable (0 percent) disabling; flexion of the leg limited to 45 degrees is rated 10 percent disabling; flexion of the leg limited to 30 degrees is rated 20 percent disabling; and flexion of the leg limited to 15 degrees is rated 30 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. 

Normal ranges of motion of the knee are to 0 degrees in extension, and to 140 degrees in flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

When rating based on limitation of motion, a separate rating may be assigned for knee disabilities based on limitation of flexion as well as limitation of extension of the knee if both pathologies exist. Likewise, separate ratings may be assigned based on limitation of flexion (Diagnostic Code 5260), as well as instability or subluxation (Diagnostic Code 5257), and separate symptomatology due to dislocation of the semilunar cartilage (Diagnostic Code 5258) or removal of semilunar cartilage (Diagnostic Code 5259), if found. See VAOPGCPREC 23-97 (Multiple Ratings for Knee Disability). 

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38C.F.R. §4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011). The final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint." Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016). VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination. Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

Turning to the evidence of record, VA treatment records note complaints of chronic joint pain, including in his knees, and his active medications include a topical medical gel applied twice daily for pain and muscle aches. See CAPRI (December 2022); CAPRI (February 2023). In September 2022, the Veteran presented with complaints of increasing right knee pain and recent onset of "catching" but he denied use of over-the-counter medications and no additional medication was prescribed; a VA bilateral knee x-ray report confirmed findings of osteoarthritis in both knees; and physical therapy was advised but not received prior to rating decision on appeal. See CAPRI (December 2022); CAPRI (February 2023). Neither the Veteran nor the record identifies non-VA treatment for his knees.  

In November 2022, the Veteran filed his claim for increased ratings along with a knee disability benefit questionnaire (DBQ) report completed by a private physician. See VA Form 21-526EZ (November 2022); VA Examination (November 2022). The knee DBQ report shows diagnoses of right and left knees osteoarthritis and recorded the Veteran's reports of decreased range of motion and daily flare-ups with prolonged walking, standing or sitting that reduce his flexibility and limits his range of motion due to severe pain and "immobility" and results in functional loss while walking, sitting, standing, and climbing stairs. See VA Examination (November 2022). 

Clinical evaluation shows the Veteran's left and right knees with range of motion from 10 degrees to 60 degrees, on active and passive testing, with evidence of pain in flexion and extension, as well as evidence of pain with weight-bearing, non-weightbearing, active motion, and passive motion causing functional loss that limits range of motion due to pain and weakness. See VA Examination (November 2022). There was no additional limitation of motion after repetitive use testing, and the report estimated additional limitation of range of motion from 20 degrees to 45 degrees in each knee due to pain during flare-ups. See VA Examination (November 2022). The report found additional factors contributing to bilateral knee disabilities as interference with standing, disturbances in locomotion, less movement than normal, weakened movement, swelling. See VA Examination (November 2022). There was no evidence of recurrent subluxation, persistent instability, or recurrent patellar instability; the Veteran did not have a history of meniscal condition or surgical procedure involving either knee; and the Veteran required occasional use of knee braces to decrease pain and help in locomotion. See VA Examination (November 2022). The report found the Veteran's bilateral knee disability resulted in functional impairment with walking, bending, and going up stairs; inability to sustain prolonged standing or walking without causing severe pain; and pain and fatigue limiting physical activity and requiring him to take frequent breaks. See VA Examination (November 2022).

The Board acknowledges that the November 2022 knee DBQ report does not fully comply with the requirement of Correia, as it does not provide specific values for weight-bearing and non-weight bearing despite noting reports of functional loss. See Id. at 158. However, the Board finds no prejudice results from such failure to provide specific values. The fundamental issue for Correia is that examinations perform adequate joint testing for pain. Id. There is no indication that the 2022 knee DBQ report contain active motion result that were not conducted in weight-bearing and passive motion testing requires the physician to force the joint through its motions while non-weight bearing, indicating similar range of motion results would apply to weight-bearing and non-weightbearing. Moreover, active motion testing produces most restrictive results as it requires a claimant to actively move through motion and tends to produce the "worst case scenario" of impairment, and thus, it would tend to support the highest possible rating. Given this understanding, and in consideration of the findings contained in the reports, the Board finds the concerns of Correia have been adequately addressed. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

On balance, in view of the foregoing, the more persuasive evidence weighs against a finding that the criteria for a higher rating are more nearly approximated during the relevant rating review period for left or right knee osteoarthritis limitation of flexion.

Neither the lay nor the medical evidence reflects that the Veteran's left or right knee is more nearly manifested by or approximates limitation of flexion to 30 degrees or less to warrant the assignment of a rating in excess of 10 percent under Diagnostic Code 5260. See 38 C.F.R. § 4. 71a. His bilateral knees had flexion limited, at most, to 45 degrees due to pain during flare-ups, which does not more nearly approximate flexion limited to 30 degrees or less. See 38 C.F.R. § 4. 71a, Diagnostic Code 5260; see also DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 202 (1995). His statements do not provide any indication of functional loss that more nearly approximates 30 degrees even if accepting his report of increased bilateral knee symptoms with prolonged walking or standing. Here, each knee is currently rated at 10 percent for limitation of flexion to 45 degrees after consideration of additional functional loss due to pain during flare-ups. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260. 

To the extent the Veteran contends that he experienced severe pain that limited his knee flexion to 30 degrees or less, the Board finds that such lay statement is inconsistent with his reports to his treating VA medical providers during this period. For example, in January 2022, the Veteran reported engaging in daily stretching, biking, and exercising; in April 2022, he reported being active and exercising daily, and riding a bike for an hour; and he is consistently evaluated as functionally independent - all of which strongly suggests range of motion greater than 30 degrees in each knee. See CAPRI (December 2022). If the Veteran had, in fact, been experiencing severe pain resulting in knee limitation of flexion to 30 degrees or less, it is reasonable to expect that he would not have been able to engage in most of those activities. See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 496, 511 (1995) (holding that the Board may consider internal consistency, and consistency with other evidence of record, when determining the credibility of lay evidence). Additionally, VA treatment records show specific chronic knee complaints in September 2022, which he described as progressing but there is no indication observed as "severe" limitation of flexion nor did the Veteran seek the recommended physical therapy prior to February 2023 rating decision on appeal, which strongly indicates that his symptomatology was not so severe as to limit flexion to 30 degrees. See CAPRI (December 2022); CAPRI (February 2023). 

Moreover, the Board's findings are not based on any ameliorative effects of medication as the lay and medical evidence of record does not indicate the Veteran regularly uses pain medication to alleviate symptomatology impacting his knees and does not require discounting during the rating review period. See Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (March 12, 2025) (the Board must discount the beneficial effects of medication when assigning an evaluation of a musculoskeletal disability). While in the past the Veteran was prescribed Tylenol and muscle relaxant for his knee symptomatology, those VA-prescriptions expired prior to the November 2022 knee DBQ report. See CAPRI (December 2022) (a September 22, 2021 VA treatment record shows the Veteran was advised to continue use of Voltaren gel, take Tylenol (Acetaminophen 325mg) as need, and take meloxicam for limited period; meloxicam was discontinued in April 2022 and Acetaminophen expired in September 2022). Additionally, the November 2022 knee DBQ report does not show he currently uses medication for his knees, and contemporaneous VA treatment records show his complaints of chronic joint pain mainly involve his hips and muscle tightness in his neck, shoulder, low back, and hips, and not specifically for knees - strongly suggesting his active prescription for topical pain medication was not used frequently for knees nor at the time of the November 2022 clinical evaluation recording range of motion findings and gathering information for estimated range of motion opinions. Thus, the Board finds there is sufficient evidence to rate the disability without remanding for an addendum opinion regarding the ameliorative effects of medication as the level of severity without the infrequently used medication would not result in a higher rating; and thus, there is no pre-decisional duty to assist error to warrant a remand per 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. 

Additionally, the Board has considered whether a higher or separate rating may be assigned under any other potentially applicable Diagnostic Code during the applicable periods under appeal for bilateral knee disability; but the Board finds no basis to do so. The Veteran already has separate 30 percent ratings for limitation of extension in each knee under Diagnostic Code 5261, and the most persuasive the lay and medical evidence does not reflect or approximate the presence of knee ankylosis or the functional equivalent of such; recurrent subluxation or instability of the knee joint; episodes of locking, pain, and effusion into the joint; impairment of the tibia and fibula; or genu recurvatum. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5256, 5257, 5259, 5261, 5262, and 5263.

The most persuasive the lay and medical evidence does not reflect or approximate the presence of knee ankylosis or the functional equivalent of ankylosis. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5256; see also Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 20 (2021) (holding that consideration must still be given to whether a claimant's functional loss "is consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis in other words, if it is the functional equivalent of ankylosis."). Ankylosis is defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 94 (32nd ed. 2012). Here, neither the VA treatment records nor the November 2022 knee DBQ report findings for ankylosis or findings consistent with the presence of functional ankylosis. To the extent that the Veteran described severe pain resulting in "immobility" in his knees, the Board finds his statements are incongruent with his reports of regularly exercising, stretching, and biking which demonstrate he retained mobility in each knee. See CAPRI (December 2022). As such, the Board finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that his left or right knee disability has not been manifested by the functional equivalent of ankylosis. See Chavis, supra. 

Moreover, even had the Veteran, assuming arguendo, had severe flare-up of knee pain productive of temporary immobility, the Board finds that there is no identifiable, discrete period of time to assign a higher rating and that doing so for a flare-up would violate the rule regarding stabilization of ratings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344. Stated differently, in the context of veterans' claims, assigning a rating in excess of 10 percent for each knee based on an isolated flare would violate the rule regarding stabilization of ratings, which directs rating officials to affect the greatest degree of stability of disability evaluations when faced with fluctuating conditions. See Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152, 158 (2009).

The evidence of record does not reflect that the Veteran's bilateral knee disability affects the tibia, fibula, or result in genu recurvatum, and therefore, Diagnostic Code 5262 and Diagnostic 5263 are not for application.

Also, neither a separate nor a higher rating is warranted for the knee based on removal of cartilage of the with symptoms under Diagnostic Codes 5258 or 5259. Although the Veteran reports episodes of right knee "catching," the medical evidence of record, including imaging studies, does not show he has dislocated semilunar cartilage with effusion into the knee joint nor is there evidence of cartilage, semilunar, removal of, symptomatic. 

Further, a separate rating is not warranted for recurrent subluxation or lateral instability under Diagnostic Code 5257. Neither the knee DBQ report nor the VA treatment records show evidence of sprain ligament, incomplete ligament tear, complete ligament tear, or a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability in either knee despite the Veteran's occasional use of braces. Also, clinical evaluation found no instability in the knees. For the above reasons, a separate disability rating under Diagnostic Code 5257 is not warranted for either knee.

On balance, as explained above, the most persuasive evidence of record weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for either the left or right knee osteoarthritis based on limitation of flexion.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Accordingly, the claims are denied.

3. Entitlement a rating in excess of 20 percent for LLE radiculopathy, sciatic nerve. 

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for RLE radiculopathy, sciatic nerve. 

An April 2020 rating decision granted service connection for LLE and RLE radiculopathy, sciatic nerve associated with service-connected lumbar spine disability and assigned each a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8520 effective from March 19, 2019. See Rating Decision (April 2020). A March 2021 rating decision awarded increased rating to 20 percent for each leg effective from February 25, 2021. See Rating Decision (March 2021). On November 29, 2022, VA received the Veteran's formal application for increased ratings for BLE sciatic nerve, which were denied in a February 15, 2023, rating decision. See VA Form 21-526 (November 2022); Rating Decision (February 2023). The Veteran has appealed the denial of higher ratings. See VA Form 20-0996 (August 2023); VA Form 10182 (January 2024). 

The relevant rating review period begins November 29, 2022, the date of the claim for increase rating with one year look back, and ends on February 15, 2023, the date of the rating decision subject to the HLR rating decision on appeal.  

The Board concludes that that the most persuasive evidence of record weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent each for LLE and RLE radiculopathy sciatic nerve. 38 U.S.C. §§1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. 

The Veteran's RLE and LLE radiculopathy sciatic nerves are rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520 (sciatic nerve).

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. Under these criteria, moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy, is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

The words "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe", "marked", and "severe" as used in the various diagnostic codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. See Spellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 211, 219 (2018). Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. 4.6. The use of the terminology within a VA examination report, moreover, is not in and of itself dispositive. Id. 

With respect to the definition of mild, moderate, and moderately severe, the Veterans Benefits Administration had already issued guidance in the M21-1 Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) defining these terms. The M21-1 is not binding on the Board and, to rely on the M21-1, the Board must conduct an independent analysis before determining whether the provisions may be relied upon as a factor to support its decision. Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018). Clearly relevant to this case are M21-1 provisions regarding evaluations of paralysis of all radicular groups. The M21-1 describes "moderate" incomplete paralysis (that is, a 20 percent rating) should be reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment, where the sensory involvement covers "a larger area in the nerve distribution." Id. M21-1 examples of a moderate disability include motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. Id. Also, the M21-1 provides that a "moderately severe" evaluation (that is, a 40 percent rating) is available when there is motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability. Id. Atrophy may, but need not, be present for a moderately severe rating. Id. Lastly, for "severe, incomplete paralysis" expect motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases. For the sciatic nerve marked muscular atrophy is expected. And even though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve. Further, neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve.

Turning to the evidence of record, VA treatment records do not show treatment for BLE radiculopathy. See CAPRI (December 2022); CAPRI (February 2023). Although VA treatment records note the Veteran's complaints of decreased sensation and weakness, they were not specifically attributed to his BLE radiculopathies and clinical evaluations consistently found normal lower extremities, without any indication of sensory, reflex, or muscle deficit. See CAPRI (December 2022); CAPRI (February 2023).

In November 2022, the Veteran filed his claim for increased ratings along with a back disability benefit questionnaire (DBQ) report completed by private physician. See VA Form 21-526EZ (November 2022); VA Examination (November 2022). The back DBQ report shows diagnoses BLE radiculopathy involving the sciatic and femoral nerves, and the Veteran reported his BLE radiculopathy has worsened and described symptoms of constant pain, moderate intermittent pain, moderate paresthesia and dysesthesias, and severe numbness bilaterally. See VA Examination (November 2022). Also, clinical evaluation revealed some reduced muscle strength (4/5) in ankle and toes without evidence muscle atrophy and the findings of decreased reflexes (1+) and decreased sensation in knees and ankles. See VA Examination (November 2022). The DBQ report found "[o]verall, the Veteran shows mild to severe sensory and objective symptoms of radiculopathy as result of progression of back condition" and noting he should be evaluated for medication and/ or surgery for relief of his symptoms. See VA Examination (November 2022).

The Board finds that the more persuasive evidence of record weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent each for RLE and LLE sciatic nerves. To warrant a higher rating, the evidence must more closely approximate moderately severe incomplete paralysis or worse. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  Here, the findings from the VA treatment records and the November 2022 back DBQ report reveal, at most, moderate severity of sciatic nerve in each leg. See VA Examination (November 2022); CAPRI (December 2022); CAPRI (February 2023).

Neither the lay nor the medical evidence reflects more than moderate impairment in the legs; and symptoms and findings that more closely approximate moderately severe impairment are not shown. In this regard, the DBQ report shows the Veteran complained of mild to severe symptomatology but clinical evaluation of the BLE revealed no more than slight decrease muscle strength and some diminished reflexes and sensation without evidence of muscle atrophy, trophic changes, or complete sensory loss. See VA Examination (November 2022). Moreover, VA treatment records reflect grossly normal and no focal deficit on clinical evaluations throughout the pendency of the rating review period. See CAPRI (December 2022); CAPRI (February 2023). Further, VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran regularly exercises, rides a bike, and is independent in all his ADLs without indication that he requires assistance in ambulation because of his BLE radiculopathy. See CAPRI (December 2022); CAPRI (February 2023). 

Overall, the Board finds that the Veteran's BLE sciatic nerves do not suggest functional impairment equivalent to moderately severe incomplete paralysis or worse in either leg as there is no more than reduced muscle strength (4/5), diminished reflexes (1+), decreased sensation, and subjective complaints of mild to severe symptomatology attributable to his BLE radiculopathy. Although reduced muscle strength and diminished reflexes tends to demonstrate moderately severe impairment as suggested by the M21-1, the Veteran has only slightly reduced muscle strength measured at 4/5 and diminished reflexes measured at 1+ which do not demonstrate muscle weakness and reduced reflexes of a higher level as associated with moderately severe or worse impairment. Even though the DBQ report found the Veteran had mild to severe sensory and subjective symptoms of radiculopathy, the Veteran does not require the use of an assistive and there was no finding muscle atrophy, trophic changes, or absence of sensation. In sum, the totality of the evidence does not suggest functional impairment equivalent to moderately severe or worse incomplete paralysis in the RLE and LLE, and ratings in excess of 20 for RLE and LLE sciatic nerve radiculopathy are not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

The Board accepts that the Veteran believes his BLE sciatic nerves warrant higher ratings. However, whether a disability meets the schedular criteria for the assignment of a higher evaluation is a factual determination by the Board based on the Veteran's complaints coupled with the medical evidence. Both the lay and medical evidence are probative in this case. Although the Veteran contends that he meets the criteria for the next higher disability rating, his complaints along with the medical findings do not meet the schedular requirements for higher evaluations than now assigned, as explained above. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8520. Further, the Board assigns greater probative value to the medical evidence, to include his VA treatment records and the DBQ report prepared by medical professionals after evaluating the Veteran and review of the record.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes. Notably, the Veteran already has separate 10 percent ratings for BLE femoral nerves under Diagnostic Code 8526, which are not on appeal. See Rating Decision Codesheet (February 2023). There is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected. Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.  

In conclusion, the Board finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claims for ratings in excess of 20 percent for RLE and LLE radiculopathy sciatic nerves.

Accordingly, the claims are denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
