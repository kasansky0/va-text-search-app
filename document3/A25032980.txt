DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment for the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) dental care provided to the Veteran on July 17, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved payment for the July 17, 2020, episode of care provided to the Veteran by the appellant.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment for the cost of non-VA dental care provided to the Veteran on July 17, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from March 2006 to October 2007 and December 2008 to November 2013.  

The appellant, Meridian Dental, is a non-VA dental provider who rendered medical care to the Veteran on July 17, 2020.  

This matter is on appeal before the Board from a February 2021 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied payment for the dental care rendered to the Veteran on July 17, 2020.  

In April 2021, the Board received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the appellant electing the Direct Review docket. 

The appellant's claim for payment for the cost of non-VA care provided to the Veteran on July 17, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.?  Specifically, in a July 15, 2021 decision, the AOJ advised the appellant their claim for payment for the July 17, 2020 episode of care was reprocessed and approved in the amount of $168.39 of the billed charges of $179.00.  ?  

The Board acknowledges the payment granted in the July 15, 2021 decision was less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for the July 17, 2020 episode of care.  If the amount paid for the July 17, 2020 episode of care was disagreeable to the appellant, the appellant was permitted to file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.  Nevertheless, the July 15, 2021 administrative action approving entitlement to payment of $168.39 of the billed charges of $179.00 for the cost of non-VA dental care provided to the Veteran during the July 17, 2020 episode of care constitutes a reversal of the prior denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.?  

Accordingly, there remains no determination with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is dismissed.?  38?U.S.C. ยง?7105(d).
