ORDER

The appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the March 2024 rating decision; the appeal is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his attorney representative and the associated fee agreement are valid. 

2. In October 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for service connection for hypertension; the subsequent March 2024 grant of service connection for hypertension was not the initial decision on the issue. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the March 2024 rating decision have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1981 to February 1989.   

The appellant is the Veteran's attorney representative. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) notes that he does not represent the Veteran in this simultaneously contested claim. 

The matter comes before the Board on appeal from an April 2024 fee decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  The Veteran did not elect to change the docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 fee decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405. Any evidence submitted after the decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the March 2024 rating decision. 

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904.

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA. The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a). A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time. Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney. To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. A direct-pay fee agreement is a fee agreement between the claimant or appellant and an agent or attorney providing for payment of fees out of past-due benefits awarded directly to an agent or attorney. A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to pay the agent or attorney out of past-due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA. A copy of a direct pay fee agreement must be filed with the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case. This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court. 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1). An attorney or agent may charge fees when past-due benefits are awarded after a Veteran has filed a supplemental claim because the decision after the supplemental claim is not the initial decision with respect to the case. See Military Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1138-41 (Fed. Cir. 2021). A case, for fees purposes, encompasses all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations. See, e.g., Perciavalle v. McDonough, 74 F.4th 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2023). A supplemental claim is any complete claim for a VA benefit on an application form prescribed by the Secretary where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(2). A supplemental claim need not be filed on a specific VA form. See Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *16-*20 (March 13, 2025). A claim for service connection and a subsequent claim for an increased rating are not the same case. See id., at *10-*11; see also, Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024). However, an attorney or agent may charge fees for the filing of a supplemental claim requesting review of the initial rating assigned for a disability after the grant of service connection, including whether a total rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is warranted. See Chisholm, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *11. The initial rating assigned is part of the claim for service connection and, therefore, part of the service connection case for fees purposes. See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484 (2006).

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).

Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be reasonable if the agent or attorney provided representation that continued through the date of the decision awarding benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f)(1).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded based on a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3). The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran. See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Jackson v. McDonald, 635 Fed. Appx. 858 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

The Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22a appointing the appellant as his representative in September 2023. At that time, the parties executed a fee agreement which states that the appellant is entitled to fees in the amount of 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded, and that fees are to be paid directly to the appellant by VA. Accordingly, the Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his attorney and the associated fee agreement are valid.

Turning to the pertinent procedural history, the AOJ denied the claim for service connection for hypertension in an October 1989 rating decision. The AOJ found that new and material evidence had not submitted to reopen the claim for service connection for hypertension in an October 2015 rating decision, November 2016 rating decision, and July 2018 rating decision. The Veteran did not file a Legacy system appeal as to any of these decisions. 

In October 2023, the appellant, on the Veteran's behalf, filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim of service connection for hypertension.

In a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for hypertension and assigned an initial 10 percent rating effective September 29, 2023. 

In an April 2024 fee decision, the AOJ found the appellant was not eligible to fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the March 2024 rating decision. The appellant filed the instant appeal. 

The Board finds the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the March 2024 rating decision. An attorney may charge fees for representation provided after the initial decision on an issue. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1). A supplemental claim filed more than a year after the initial rating decision is part of the original case, and an attorney may charge fees for representation provided in filing that supplemental claim. See Military-Veterans Advocacy, 7 F.4th at 1138-41. Here, the March 2024 rating decision was not the initial decision on the claim, as it had been last previously denied in a July 2018 rating decision, and the October 2023 supplemental claim was a continuation of adjudication on that issue. Thus, because the October 2023 supplemental claim seeking service connection for the previously denied claim of service connection for hypertension resulted in the grant of service connection for hypertension, the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees arising out of this grant.
