ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of June 28, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of June 28, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for sinusitis is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On June 28, 2022, the Veteran first filed a formal claim seeking entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis claimed as due to in-service exposure to fine particulate matter and/or burn pits and other toxins while deployed to Iraq in 1991.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence plausibly establishes that the Veteran served in Iraq during Desert Storm between July 1991 and October 1991.  The evidence verifies additional service in Somalia between October 1993 and February 1994. 

3. The Veteran was granted service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis on a presumptive basis due to in-service exposure to burn pits and other toxins and was assigned an effective date of August 10, 2022, the date that the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was enacted.  The PACT Act presumptively linked allergic rhinitis and sinusitis to in-service exposure to burn pits and other toxins for those veterans who served in Iraq and/or Somalia on or after August 2, 1990.  

4. The evidence is in approximate balance that the Veteran's current allergic rhinitis and sinusitis were incurred during the Veteran's active duty service, and thus, entitlement to service connection first arose as of the June 28, 2022 date of claim. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of June 28, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1119, 1120, 5110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.303, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of June 28, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for sinusitis have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1119, 1120, 5110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.303, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1990 to September 1994. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Board of Veterans' Appeals' (Board) Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The time for a Board docket change under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not elapsed.  However, since the Board can issue a fully favorable decision, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with the adjudication of this appeal.  

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7104, Board decisions must be based on the entire record in the proceeding and upon consideration of all evidence and material of record and applicable provisions of law and regulation.  The law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-29 (2000).  The Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence within the period on appeal and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claims.  The Veteran must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein.  See Timberlake, supra.

1. Entitlement to an effective date of June 28, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of June 28, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for sinusitis is granted.

In April 2023 and May 2023 rating decisions, the AOJ assigned an effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.  On appeal, the Veteran's attorney has argued that the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date of June 28, 2022, for the award of service connection for these disabilities.  Following a complete review of the relevant evidence of record, the Board agrees and shall award an effective date of June 28, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis based on the analysis below. 

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service.  Otherwise, for an award based on an original claim, claim reopened after a final disallowance, or claim for an increased rating, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

In the present case, the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to burn pits and other toxins pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1119 based on his verified service in Somalia from October 1993 to February 1994.  The Veteran was awarded service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis because these disabilities are presumptively related to in-service exposure to burn pits and under toxins pursuant to the PACT Act's creation of 38 U.S.C §§ 1119 and 1120.  Claims granted under the PACT Act will be effective no earlier than August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the law.  An earlier effective date may be warranted, however, if the grant is based on another theory of entitlement, such as direct service connection, secondary service connection, or a presumption other than those identified under the PACT Act. 

In the August 2024 appellate brief, the Veteran's attorney argued that the AOJ "erred by arbitrarily setting the effective date of the award of service connection based on the date of the August 8, 2022 VA examination."  The attorney further argued that "an effective date must not be based arbitrarily on the date of a diagnosis-rather, entitlement arises on the date that the disability manifests regardless of how long it goes undiagnosed thereafter."  The attorney stated that the AOJ misapplied the concept of "date entitlement arose" because, in his view, the AOJ relied on the date of diagnosis at a VA examination to assign an effective date despite evidence in the record showing the disabilities were present and active at the time of the June 28, 2022 date of claim.  Accordingly, he argued that the Veteran was entitled to the earlier effective date of June 28, 2022, for the award of service connection for his allergic rhinitis and sinusitis. 

The Board agrees that an earlier effective date of June 28, 2022, is warranted for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, but not in accordance with the Veteran's attorney's argument.  This is because the attorney's argument is predicated on the fundamental mistaken belief that the AOJ assigned the August 10, 2022 effective date because this is the first date that the evidence showed a clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.  In advancing this argument, the attorney appears to have conflated the August 10, 2022 effective date of service connection with the date of the August 8, 2022 VA examination.  If the AOJ awarded service connection based on the mechanical exercise of applying the effective date of the VA examination first showing a clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, the AOJ would have granted service connection as of August 8, 2022, the date of the VA examination first showing a factually ascertainable clinical diagnosis.  This is not what happened in this case.  

Contrary to the attorney's assertion, the AOJ did not select the August 10, 2022 effective date because it was the first date that a clinical diagnosis was confirmed; instead, this date was selected because it was the effective date of the PACT Act, and the claims were being granted pursuant to the PACT ACT's newly added presumptive service connection provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1119 and 1120.  Thus, in the AOJ's view, August 10, 2022, was the "date entitlement arose" because it was the first date that presumptive service connection could be granted under the PACT Act.  As noted above, claims granted pursuant to the PACT Act can be effective no earlier than August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the Act.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).  However, the AOJ's approach in assigning the August 10, 2022 effective date was short-sighted, as a grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis on a direct basis would have allowed for an earlier effective date back to the June 28, 2022 date of claim.  

Indeed, in the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ identified a predecisional duty to assist error and requested VA medical opinions addressing whether direct service connection was warranted for the Veteran's allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.  Unfortunately, the resulting December 2023 VA medical opinion focused on the fact that presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 was not warranted because the conditions were not diagnosed within 10 years of service separation (addressed further below), and there was "no objective evidence in the Veteran's service records indicating that the Veteran's claim[ed] sinusitis and/or chronic [allergic rhinitis] was diagnosed while in service."

The Board cannot find this December 2023 VA medical opinion to be adequate for adjudicative purposes as it relied exclusively on the absence of evidence in the Veteran's service treatment records, and it did not address the Veteran's competent and credible lay reports of allergic rhinitis and sinusitis symptoms since his active duty service.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020) (explaining that a VA examination is inadequate if the examiner does not consider lay evidence); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007) (similarly holding that, when the Veteran has provided lay testimony of an in-service injury, an examiner cannot ignore that lay evidence and base his or her opinion on a lack of corroborating medical records). 

At the August 2022 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with sinusitis.  He alleged that his symptoms had initial onset in 1991 while serving in Iraq during the first Gulf War and continued to the present.  The Veteran's service department records do not expressly verify that the Veteran served in Iraq, but there are notations that he was deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991, participated in Operation Desert Storm from July 1991 to October 1991, and was awarded the Southwest Asia Service Medal.  Given these factors, it is plausible that the Veteran served in Iraq during 1991, and the Board finds his lay reports to be consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service as shown by service records.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

In March 2023, the Veteran attended an additional VA examination, where diagnoses of chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis were verified.  The Veteran alleged the date of onset for his symptoms as "throughout his military career."  It was noted that the Veteran had persistent nasal congestion, discharge/dripping, and sinus/eye irritation and pain while deployed to Iraq during Desert Storm, where he was exposed to burn pits and burning trash.  The Veteran reported that his condition had progressed and worsened since initial onset. 

In November 2023, the Veteran attended a final VA examination, where diagnoses of chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis were verified.  Again, the Veteran reported that his symptoms began in 1991 while serving in Desert Storm.  The Veteran stated that his conditions began "after assisting in burning trash duties."  At the onset of his conditions, he experienced facial pain, frequent nasal congestion, itchy eyes/throat, and a stuffy nose.  He alleged that his conditions occurred on a continuous basis to the present.

Despite the lack of documentation of sinusitis or allergic rhinitis in the Veteran's service treatment records, the Veteran has consistently reported that the symptoms of his sinusitis and allergic rhinitis began in approximately 1991 during his deployment in Iraq, where he was exposed to burn pits and burning trash.  He alleged that his symptoms continued on a recurrent basis through the present, and they were ultimately diagnosed as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.  As a layperson, the Veteran is competent to report symptoms observable to his senses, and his allegations are credible as they have remained consistent over time.  

The Board finds the Veteran's lay reports are sufficient to satisfy the medical nexus element of a direct service connection claim, as he has probatively reported allergic rhinitis and sinusitis symptoms on a continuous basis since their onset in 1991 while serving in the Southwest Asia theater of operations.  These symptoms were eventually relied upon to support a clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d), "[s]ervice connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service," and the Veteran's lay reports are sufficient to meet this requirement.  As the record shows a current disability; in-service symptoms and in-service exposure to burn pits and other toxins; and lay evidence competently bridging the evidentiary gap between the Veteran's current disability and his service, the elements of direct service connection have been met.  

As the claims can succeed on a direct service connection basis, the AOJ should have granted an effective date of June 28, 2022, as entitlement to service connection was established on the date of claim, regardless of the applicability of the PACT Act.  Consistent with the analysis above, the Board shall grant entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis as of the earlier date of June 28, 2022, and on this limited basis, the Veteran's appeals are granted.  This is the relief expressly requested by the Veteran's attorney and fully resolves the Veteran's appeals.  

It is undisputed in the record that the Veteran first filed a claim seeking entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis on June 28, 2022, and this filing date is more than 27 years after the Veteran's separation from service.  Applying the general effective date rules in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2), the date of claim is the earliest date for which service connection may be achieved.  There is no evidence or argument supporting an effective date earlier than June 28, 2022, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.  

Lastly, the Board acknowledges that allergic rhinitis and sinusitis are diseases presumptively linked to fine particular matter for veterans who served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations under 38 C.F.R. § 3.320.  In the April 2023 and May 2023 rating decisions, the AOJ declined to apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §3.320 because the record lacked objective evidence showing that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis and sinusitis were manifested to any degree within 10 years from the date of the Veteran's separation from service.  

However, on September 1, 2023, after service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis had been established, VA issued a final rule revising 38 C.F.R. § 3.320, easing the evidentiary burden of Gulf War veterans who file claims with VA for asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis.  See 88 Fed. Reg. 60336 (Sept. 1, 2023), Presumptive Service Connection for Respiratory Conditions Due to Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter.  Specifically, VA amended 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(2) to remove the 10-year manifestation requirement for asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis (to include rhinosinusitis), now indicating that the presumption is available if the disabilities manifest to any degree "at any time following" separation from a qualifying period of military service.  This new rule became effective on October 31, 2023.  It is questionable whether the amended version of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 is applicable to the Veteran's claims, as it became effective after the ratings decisions granting service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis were issued.  

Even if the amended version of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 was applicable to the Veteran's claims, or if the Board were to determine that the lay evidence was sufficient to show manifestation of sinusitis and allergic rhinitis within 10 years of separation from service under the pre-amended version of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320, the earliest effective date possible under the law is the June 28, 2022 date of claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  As the Veteran has been awarded this effective date on a direct service connection basis for his allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, no further analysis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 is warranted, as it could not result in an effective date earlier than June 28, 2022, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.  

Based on the foregoing, the Veteran's appeal seeking an effective date of June 28, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis is granted.
