ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for headaches is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for left wrist carpal tunnel syndrome is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for ingrown toenails is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his headaches began during active service.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had bilateral wrist carpal tunnel syndrome, ingrown toenails, hemorrhoids or constipation at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for headaches are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left wrist carpal tunnel syndrome have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for ingrown toenails have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

5. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

6. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for constipation have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from August 1989 to April 1992.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

1. Entitlement to service connection for headaches is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for migraine headaches, which he believes are due to completing his job responsibilities in service, to include field training, squadron runs, and getting new families settled in with housing. 

For the reasons discussed below, the Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that began during active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).

The April 2024 rating decision includes two favorable findings: (1) the Veteran has a current diagnosis of acute intermittent tension headaches; and (2) a March 1992 service treatment record shows a complaint of frequent headaches.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  These favorable findings satisfy the first two requirements for service connection.  Thus, the only issue remaining is whether there is a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67.

Turning to the evidence of record, in a June 1989 Report of Medical History for enlistment, the Veteran denies frequent or severe headaches.  

In a March 1992 Report of Medical History, the Veteran reports frequent and severe headaches.  In section 25 of the Report, the clinician comments that the headaches were not recent, were not frequent, and were successfully treated with Tylenol.

VA obtained an opinion concerning the Veteran's claimed migraine headaches in April 2024.   The Veteran reported he had acute, intermittent tension headaches that were not chronic.  The Veteran reported the headaches began while in service in around 1992, occurred once or twice every couple of weeks, and were mild.  He reported he managed the headaches with Tylenol.  He reported that the headache frequency and pain have increased since leaving service, and that he now has headaches lasting for one to three hours and occurring every two to three days.  He denied any head injury pre or post service.

In the "Evidence Review" portion of the April 2024 VA examination report, the examiner stated that he was unable to confirm a current chronic diagnosis of headache (including migraine) with the current available service or post treatment records and therefore no diagnosis was warranted.  The examiner stated that VA post service medical records were silent for any complaint of, treatment for, or diagnosis of a headache; that the Veteran's complaint of headaches was subjective only; and that the Veteran denied past or present medical appointments or imaging concerning his claimed medical condition.  In Section III of the VA examination report, the examiner gave a negative nexus opinion.  As a rationale, the examiner stated that there was a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of acute/intermittent tension headaches, not chronic, and military service, and that without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury was considered to be a more likely etiology.

After reviewing the evidence of record, and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection is warranted.  The Veteran has essentially reported that his recurrent headaches began in service and have continued since.  The Veteran is competent to report onset and continuity of his symptoms.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  There is no reason to doubt the veracity of his report based on review of the claims file.  When a claim involves a diagnosis based on purely subjective complaints, the Board is within its province to weigh the Veteran's testimony and determine whether it supports a finding of service incurrence and continued symptoms since service.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 305 (2007).  If it does, such testimony is sufficient to establish service connection.  Id.  

The Board assigns no probative weight to the April 2024 VA examination report because it is internally inconsistent:  the examiner indicated both that a diagnosis was not warranted and that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of acute/intermittent tension headaches, not chronic.  Further, the opinion is inadequate because the examiner appears to have disregarded the Veteran's lay statements and improperly relied on the absence of treatment records to support a negative nexus opinion.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

In sum, the credible, competent and probative evidence weighs in favor of the claim.  Accordingly, service connection for headaches is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome is denied.

3. Entitlement to service connection for left wrist carpal tunnel syndrome is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, which he asserts is due to performing his daily job requirements in service.  His DD Form 214 indicates his military occupational specialty was administrative specialist.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

Turning to the evidence of record, Reports of Medical Examination dated June 1989 and March 1992 indicate normal clinical evaluations of the upper extremities. 

Service treatment records, as well as post-service treatment records, are silent for any complaints, diagnosis or treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome.

While the Veteran may believe he has a current diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education and training. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence, which fails to show the Veteran has had any complaints, symptoms, diagnosis or treatment for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome during and after service.

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination for his claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel but finds an examination is not required.  The Secretary must provide a VA medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-86 (2006).

In this case, there is no competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability. There also is no medical or lay evidence of  carpal tunnel symptoms in service or indication that the claimed disability may be associated with the Veteran's service. Thus, the low standard of McLendon has not been met and a VA examination is not warranted.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim for entitlement to service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

4. Service connection for ingrown toenails is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for ingrown toenails, which he contends are due to wearing boots and running miles in service.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of ingrown toenails and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. at 294; McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321.

Turning to the evidence of record, in a June 1989 Report of Medical History, the Veteran denies foot trouble.  A June 1989 Report of Medical Examination indicates a normal clinical evaluation of the feet, except for mild asymptomatic pes planus. In a March 1992 Report of Medical History, the Veteran reports foot trouble.  In section 25 of the Report, the clinician commented that the Veteran's reported foot trouble was his ankle.  A March 1992 Report of Medical Examination indicates a normal clinical evaluation of the feet.

The Veteran's service treatment records and post-service treatment records are silent for complaints, treatment or diagnosis for ingrown toenails.

While the Veteran may believe he has a current diagnosis of ingrown toenails, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education and training. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4.  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence, which fails to show the Veteran has had any complaints, symptoms, diagnosis or treatment for ingrown toenails both during and after service.

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for his claimed ingrown toenails.  As noted above, VA's duty to provide an examination is not limitless and is only triggered when there is, among other things, competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and an indication of a link between a veteran's claimed disability and service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4); McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 81-86. Here, the record does not show a diagnosis of ingrown toenails.  Further, the record does not indicate a link between a current ingrown toenail disability and an in-service event.  Thus, the low standard of McLendon has not been met and a VA examination is not warranted.

Because the evidence of record weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable.  Entitlement to service connection for ingrown toenails is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

5. Service connection for hemorrhoids is denied.

6. Service connection for constipation is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for hemorrhoids, which he contends are due to the food selection and dehydrated meals eaten in Western Germany.  The Veteran also seeks service connection for constipation, which he contends is due to dehydration from squadron runs. 

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of hemorrhoids or constipation and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. at 294; McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321.

Turning to the evidence of record, a June 1989 Report of Medical Examination indicates a normal clinical evaluation of the anus and rectum.  In a June 1989 Report of Medical History, the Veteran denies intestinal trouble and rectal disease.

In a March 1992 Report of Medical History, the Veteran denies rectal disease and intestinal trouble.  A March 1992 Report of Medical Examination indicates a normal clinical evaluation of the anus and rectum.

Service treatment records are silent for complaints, treatment, or diagnoses of hemorrhoids and constipation.  

On the Veteran's October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, he describes in-service events, but does not describe current symptoms, or any treatment for the claimed hemorrhoids and constipation. The Veteran's post-service medical records do not otherwise reveal any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses of these claimed conditions during the pendency of the appeal or recent to the filing of the claim. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran, as a lay person, is competent to report constipation; however, as stated previously, he has reported in-service constipation, and not current complaints, symptoms, or treatment for constipation. While the Veteran believes he has hemorrhoids or a gastrointestinal disorder manifested as constipation, he is not competent to diagnose either.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires medical knowledge and training.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4.  The record does not show that he has the skills or medical training to make such a determination. 

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for hemorrhoids and constipation.  As noted above, VA's duty to provide an examination is not limitless and is only triggered when there is, among other things, competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and an indication of a link between a veteran's claimed disability and service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4); McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 81-86.

Here, the record does not show any diagnosis of hemorrhoids or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a hemorrhoid or constipation disability.  Further, the record does not indicate a link between any current hemorrhoid or constipation disability and the claimed in-service event (namely, the food the Veteran consumed and the dehydration he reported experiencing decades ago while he was in service).  Thus, the low standard of McLendon has not been met and a VA examination is not warranted.

Entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids and constipation is denied.  Because the evidence of record weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
