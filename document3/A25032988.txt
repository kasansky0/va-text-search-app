REMANDED

The appeal as to the appellant's eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the February 2024 rating decision is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1984 to May 1994.  

The appellant is the Veteran's former attorney representative. 

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 fee decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), in which the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) found that the appellant was not eligible to fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in a February 2024 rating decision that granted an increased rating for major depressive disorder effective December 15, 2023, and entitlement to a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) effective August 4, 2023. 

The appellant filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) in April 2024. 

The Board finds that remand is warranted in order to provide corrective notice, because the February 2024 fee decision is incomplete and does not properly identify the full issue at the center of the present appeal. See 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.3103(f). Notably, the February 2024 fee decision does not identify the amount of past-due benefits from which attorney fees is now sought and incorrectly states that the amount of past-due benefits is $0.00. The Board finds that this statement is incorrect because the February 2024 rating decision created a retroactive award. See February 2024 Rating Decision- Codesheet, February 2024 Award Print. The appellant, and particularly the Veteran who would be required to return the fee amount from the past-due benefits if an attorney fee were to be granted, is entitled to know the amount of money in dispute and as it currently stands, the existing fee decision is legally inadequate in this respect. 

Thus, as the February 2024 fee decision does not indicate the specific amount of the retroactive award as well as the proper amount withheld for fees (20 percent of the past-due benefits awarded), the Board finds that the AOJ committed error in that the February 2024 fee decision failed to meet the notice requirements under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.802(a). Accordingly, remand is necessary for the AOJ to clarify the total amount of past-due benefits awarded in the February 2024 rating decision, from which a 20 percent attorney fee is now sought on appeal, and appropriately notify both contested claimants in a corrected fee decision on the matter.
