ORDER

The appeal for a compensable rating for a headache disability is dismissed.  

The appeal for an increased rating for a right knee disability is dismissed. 

The appeal for an increased rating for a lumbar spine disability is dismissed. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's untimely appeal for a compensable rating for his headache disability does not conform to claims processing rules. 

2. The Veteran submitted both a VA Form 20-0995 Higher-Level Review Request and a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal on August 8, 2022, regarding his right knee disability, and therefore his appeal to the Board was an impermissible concurrent election. 

3. The Veteran submitted both a VA Form 20-0995 Higher-Level Review Request and a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal on August 8, 2022, regarding his lumbar spine disability, and therefore his appeal to the Board was an impermissible concurrent election. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for a compensable rating for a headache disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for an increased rating for the Veteran's right knee disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. 

3. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for an increased rating for the Veteran's lumbar spine disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2009 to July 2010. 

Headaches

The Board shall not entertain an application for review on appeal unless it conforms to the law. 38 U.S.C. § 7108. Under the AMA framework, an appeal consists of a properly completed VA Form 10182 submitted to the Board within one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of its decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

The Veteran submitted an August 2022 VA Form 10182. In that form, he indicated that he was appealing an August 2022 rating decision for a headache disability. However, the rating decision issued on that date did not address headaches. Rather, a compensable rating for headaches was denied in a March 2020 rating decision. The Veteran was notified that he had one year from the date of the decision to select a review option, including an appeal to the Board.

The case of Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021), involving a late-filed notice of disagreement, held the "timeliness provision regarding substantive appeals is not jurisdictional in nature and serves as a claims-processing mechanism."  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have reported any circumstances relating to the delayed filing of the Veteran's August 2022 VA Form 10182 for which consideration of equitable tolling provisions may be warranted, nor did they request an extension of time in which to file an appeal for good cause.  Indeed, the Veteran was able to submit additional claims in April 2020.

Based on the foregoing, absent good cause and/or circumstances warranting equitable tolling, the Veteran's August 2022 VA Form 10182 is untimely under VA claims processing rules as it relates to the claim for a headache disability. Dismissal of the appeal is appropriate.

If the Veteran wishes to revisit this claim, he may file a Supplemental Claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Lumbar Spine and Right Knee

The Veteran's claims for higher ratings for lumbar spine and right knee disabilities were denied in November 2021. On August 8, 2022, the Veteran submitted both a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review and a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) for his lumbar spine and right knee disabilities. In October 2024, the Board notified the Veteran of his concurrent election and clarified that if he did not submit a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days, his August 8, 2022, VA Form 10182 would be dismissed. The Veteran did not respond or submit a new VA Form 10182.  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, claimants may elect to review a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) by filing a supplemental claim, HLR request, or Board appeal. Current regulations prohibit concurrent election of review of a VA decision under different appeal lanes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited. The Court held that a claimant could select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). The Court's holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple administrative review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); Id. at 2-3. Accordingly, the Court's holding in Terry makes it clear that only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues.

Here, the Board lacks jurisdiction to address the above claims, as doing so would constitute an impermissible concurrent election. Therefore, the appeals are dismissed as a matter of law.
