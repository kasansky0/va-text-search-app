DOCKET NO. 240627-451268
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

An effective date earlier than May 6, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time of receipt of the May 6, 2021, Intent to File, there were no pending service connection or increased rating claims; nor was there a formal claim or intent to file a claim of entitlement to TDIU of record at that time.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than May 6, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to TDIU have not been met 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 1975 to July 1981 and from March 2008 to April 2009.

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2024 decision. In June 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2024 decision.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

An effective date earlier than May 6, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to TDIU is denied.

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to May 6, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to TDIU. In this regard, the Veteran's representative has argued for both August 15, 2013, and June 9, 2015, as appropriate effective dates.

A claim for a TDIU is a claim for an increased rating. Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 31-32 (2007). The provisions governing the assignment of the effective date of an increased rating are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) and (b)(2), and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

The effective date for an award of increased compensation will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). However, an exception is available when the evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation. If an increase in disability occurred within one-year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

In this regard, the law provides that a TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Court has also held that a claim of entitlement to TDIU is part and parcel of an underlying increased rating claim, when raised during the open appeal period. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

Here, the record reflects that the Veteran was employed full-time until June 2015. In April 2016, he filed a VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. In a July 2016 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to TDIU. The Veteran did not appeal that decision.  

In a September 2018 Board decision, which involved the adjudication of several increased ratings claims, the Board noted that "the Veteran's TDIU claim was denied by the RO in an unappealed rating decision dated July 2016. The Veteran has not since contended that he is unemployable due to his PTSD or right ankle disabilities on appeal such that remand of a TDIU claim pursuant to Rice is for consideration."

The Veteran did not appeal the September 2018 Board decision, or file any claims, until a May 6, 2021, VA 21-0966 Intent to File was received. Such represents the date that the Veteran's effective date for TDIU was derived from.

The Veteran's representative has argued that VA failed to infer TDIU at the time of a March 2020 rating decision, which granted service connection for sleep apnea, and awarded an effective date of August 19, 2013. However, the March 2020 rating decision adjudicated a service connection claim, not an increased rating claim, and, accordingly, TDIU is not raised by the record as part of this appeal per Rice.

The Veteran's representative has also argued that TDIU was raised by the record but unadjudicated, and should be effective June 9, 2015, the day after the Veteran's final day of gainful employment. The Board disagrees. As shown above, the Veteran did not appeal the July 2016 denial of TDIU by the AOJ. In September 2018, the Board explicitly stated that TDIU was not raised as part of the pending appeal. The Veteran did not appeal the September 2018 Board decision, or submit any correspondence to VA until his May 6, 2021, Intent to File, was received.

Accordingly, the record reflects that, at the time of receipt of the May 6, 2021, Intent to File, there were no pending service connection or increased rating claims to allow for an earlier effective date for TDIU under Rice. There was also no unadjudicated claim of entitlement to TDIU of record prior to May 6, 2021. Consequently, there is no basis for the Board to award an effective date for entitlement to a TDIU earlier than May 6, 2021.

Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs against the grant of an effective date earlier than May 6, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to TDIU. As such, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply, and the claim is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).
