Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ambulance transport provided to the Veteran by a County emergency medical service (EMS) on May 29, 2023.

REASONS FOR REMAND

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 decision of the C.W. Bill Young Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center Beneficiary Travel Department. In August 2023, the Veteran appealed to the Board via a VA Form 10182 and elected the Evidence Submission docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. 

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(ii).

Turning to the laws and regulations, under 38 U.S.C. § 1728, a veteran may be entitled to payment or reimbursement of unauthorized medical expenses incurred at a non-VA facility for treatment of a service-connected disability, or a nonservice-connected disability associated with and held to be aggravating a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1728; 38 C.F.R. § 17.120. Claims under 38 U.S.C. § 1728 must be filed within 2 years after the date the care or services were rendered, or in the case of services rendered prior to a VA adjudication allowing service-connection the claim must be filed within 2 years of the date the veteran was notified by VA of the allowance of the award of service-connection.

Veterans not eligible for reimbursement under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1728 may, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1725, be reimbursed for the reasonable value of emergency treatment furnished in a non-VA facility if they are active VA health-care participants (i.e., enrolled in the annual patient enrollment system and recipients of a VA hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care under such system within the last 24-month period) and are personally liable for such non-VA treatment. 38 U.S.C. § 1725; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000-1008.

To receive payment or reimbursement for emergency services under 38 U.S.C. § 1725, a claimant must file a claim within 90 days after the latest of the following: the date that the veteran was discharged from the facility that furnished the emergency treatment; the date of death, if the death occurred during transportation to a facility for emergency treatment or during the stay in the facility that included the provision of the emergency treatment; or the date the veteran finally exhausted, without success, action to obtain payment or reimbursement for the treatment from a third party. 38 C.F.R. § 17.1004(d). 

The Board notes that 38 U.S.C. § 1725 was recently amended, generally increasing the time limit for a private medical provider to file a claim with VA for payment or reimbursement for applicable emergency care to 180 days and requiring that a veteran not be held liable for payment of the treatment in cases where the claim was filed after this deadline.

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 111 and 38 C.F.R. part 70, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) may make payments for travel expenses incurred in the United States to help veterans and other persons obtain care or services from VHA including for travel by ambulance, if necessary. 38 C.F.R. §§ 70.1-70.20. Persons eligible for beneficiary travel payments are listed under 38 C.F.R. § 70.10 and include veterans traveling to or from a VA facility or VA-authorized health care facility for examination, treatment, or care, and who have a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more, are traveling for treatment of a service-connected disability, or are unable to defray the expenses of such travel. 38 C.F.R. § 70.10 (a).

Historically, on May 29, 2023, the Veteran was transported by a County EMS from his home to a non-VA emergency department after being diagnosed as hypotensive. He seeks reimbursement for the transportation.

The June 2023 denial letter explained that the Veteran's travel did not meet the eligibility criteria for transportation benefits as the travel was not for a scheduled compensation and pension examination, he was not vision impaired, had a spinal cord injury, or was an amputee, and the travel was not in connection with VA's special disabilities rehabilitation program, and his annual income for the calendar year immediately preceding the date of transport exceeded the maximum annual rate of VA pension.

A subsequent September 2024 letter denied the claim for payment or reimbursement of the ambulance transport expenses on the basis that emergency treatment was not provided for an adjudicated service connected disability, the Veteran was not treated for a non-service connected disability aggravated with and aggravating a service connected disability, he was did not have a total disability permanent in nature resulting from a service-connected disability, he was not treated for an illness, injury, or dental condition while participating in a rehabilitation program, and the treatment was not provided for an acute suicidal crisis. 

The claim was also denied on the basis that it was not timely filed within 90 days after the latest of the following: 1) the date the Veteran was discharged from the facility that furnished the emergency treatment, 2) the date of death, if death occurred during transportation to a facility for emergency treatment or if the death occurred during the stay in the facility that included the provision of the emergency treatment, or c) the date the Veteran finally exhausted, without success, action to obtain payment or reimbursement from a third party. 

Although the appeal was adjudicated under 38 U.S.C. § 111, a regulation on ambulance costs typically paid as VA beneficiary travel, this case appears to involve emergency medical treatment at a non-VA facility. 

The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, implemented at 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000-1008, provides general authority for reimbursement for the reasonable value of emergency treatment furnished in a non-VA facility to those veterans who are active VA health-care participants (i.e., enrolled in the annual patient enrollment system and recipients of a VA hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care under such system within the last 24-month period) and who are personally liable for such non-VA treatment and not eligible for reimbursement under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1728. 

The law and regulations governing beneficiary travel under 38 U.S.C. § 111 explicitly do "not cover payment for emergency transportation of veterans for non-service-connected conditions in non-VA facilities when the payment for transportation is covered by §§ 17.1000 through 17.1008 of this chapter, as authorized by 38 U.S.C. § 1725." 38 C.F.R. § 70.1.

Payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for ambulance services, may be made for transporting a veteran to a facility where payment or reimbursement is authorized under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for emergency treatment provided at a non-VA facility, or payment or reimbursement would have been authorized under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for emergency treatment had the veteran's personal liability for the emergency treatment not been fully extinguished by payment by a third party, including under a health-plan contract, or by VA, where the veteran: is financially liable to the provider of the emergency transportation; does not have coverage under a health-plan contract that would fully extinguish the medical liability for the emergency transportation; has no contractual or legal recourse against a third party that could reasonably be pursued for the purpose of fully extinguishing the veteran's liability to the provider; and is not eligible for reimbursement for any emergency treatment expenses under 38 U.S.C. § 1728. 38 C.F.R. § 17.1003.

Based on the Veteran's contentions that he required ambulance transport for an emergency, the AOJ should have also adjudicated the Veteran's reimbursement claim as one for beneficiary travel benefits (38 U.S.C. § 111) and for emergency travel expenses to a non-VA facility under 38 C.F.R. § 17.1003.

As VHA did not develop and adjudicate the issue under 38 U.S.C. § 1725, the record does not contain sufficient evidence to establish whether the May 29, 2023, emergency ambulance service would have been payable under 38 U.S.C. § 1725.

As noted above, the Veteran was diagnosed as hypotensive and taken to the emergency room. However, the non-VA hospital medical records remain outstanding and have not been sought. The failure to obtain such treatment records constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist omission. Remand is necessary to obtain those treatment records.

Next, a VA internal document notes that an Explanation of Benefits was received on July 19, 2023, and a claim for payment or reimbursement received on December 22, 2023. As it is unclear whether VHA considered the claim under the amended time limit, the Board finds that remand is warranted, to provide an adequate notice of decision which clearly addresses the 180-day time limit, and the date of the original claim.

Further, the Veteran's record indicates that he was a member of a Medicare plan on the date of service, and whether Medicare could have been the initial payer of the ambulance bill. Medicare is considered other health insurance. As the reviewable evidence of record does not indicate whether other criteria for reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 have been met, including whether the Veteran was an active VA health-care participant at the time of the treatment and whether the Veteran had coverage under a health-plan contract, the record needs to be developed for a claim for reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. § 1725. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a) ("[d]ecisions of the Board shall be based on the entire record in the proceeding and upon consideration of all evidence and material of record and applicable provisions of law and regulation").

As correction of these errors by the AOJ in satisfying its regulatory and statutory duties would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the medical reimbursement claim on appeal, the appeal must be remanded for the VHA to associate such pertinent records with the file, properly adjudicate the Veteran's claim under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and provide appropriate notice of the decision under 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b) to the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Ask the Veteran to submit authorizations for VA to secure for the record complete clinical records from the non-VA emergency department for treatment provided on May 29, 2023. If he does so, obtain those records.

2. Thereafter, adjudicate the claim of entitlement to payment or reimbursement of ambulance expenses incurred on May 29, 2023, under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000-1008. 

This includes the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 17.1003 allowing for payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for ambulance transportation to a non-VA facility where payment or reimbursement would have been authorized under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for emergency treatment had the Veteran's personal liability for the emergency treatment not been fully extinguished by payment by a third party, including under a health-plan contract.

Adjudication includes taking all appropriate action to determine whether ambulance services provided by Manatee County EMS on May 29, 2023, was submitted for payment/approval under the Veteran's other health insurance, Medicare Part B.

3. All inquiries, both positive and negative, should be documented by the record. If these costs were submitted for approval by Medicare, documentation of the notice letter/date of any decision should be obtained and associated with the Veteran's claim.

4. If a claim has already been filed with Medicare, the AOJ must determine whether the remaining balance, if any remains, is for a copayment, deductible, coinsurance, or other medical expense.
