2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, Pub. L. No. 117-168, 403(d)(2) (2022).

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for heart disability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from February 1969 to February 1971.  He is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents during service.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In November 2024, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) vacated and remanded a March 2024 Board decision pursuant to a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR).  Specifically, the parties agreed that the Board never discussed (a) that the May 2023 examiner opined that the Veteran's blockage from calcification and not cholesterol was typical with Agent Orange exposure; (b) that the Veteran's private doctor opined that his development of hypertension was consistent with Agent Orange exposure; (c) that the Veteran himself recounted he oversaw the removal of contaminated soil at Fort Gordon; or (d) the March 2023 Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum conceding toxic exposure in service.  The parties further agreed that the Board never explained its basis for rejecting the Veteran's contention of exposure to Agent Orange.  Additionally, the parties agreed that the Board erred by failing to discuss whether a claim for bilateral foot fibromas was reasonably raised by the record.

For the sake of clarity, the Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claim of service connection for soft tissue sarcoma to a claim of service connection for bilateral plantar fibromas.

Within 90 days of the November 2024 JMR, in November 2024, the Veteran submitted additional argument pointing out that the March 2023 TERA memorandum showed that the Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange during service and that his VA Medical Center treatment records show "soft tissue masses in his feet" rather than soft tissue sarcomas, and that the VA examination was inadequate.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).  38 U.S.C. § 7107(b).

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.  Service connection may also be granted for a disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran's service records document exposure to herbicide agents during service.  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.  Diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e) warrant service connection on a presumptive basis due to exposure to herbicides.  See also 38 U.S.C. § 1116.

The standard of proof to be applied in decisions on claims for VA benefits is set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  Under that provision, VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary.  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  Id.; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  "It is in recognition of our debt to our veterans that society has [determined that,] [b]y tradition and by statute, the benefit of the doubt belongs to the veteran."  Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54.

1. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension

3. Entitlement to service connection for a heart disability

The Veteran contends that his diabetes mellitus type II ("diabetes"), hypertension, and heart disability are caused by his exposure to herbicide agents during service.

As discussed above, the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents during service.  He is diagnosed as having, in pertinent part, coronary arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, among other disabilities.  Coronary arteriosclerosis is a form of coronary artery disease as indicated in the Veteran's VA Medical Center treatment records.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e), coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes are listed among diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents. 

Also, on August 10, 2022, the President signed into law the Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins (PACT) Act of 2022.  Among other things, the Act added hypertension to the list of diseases presumed to be associated with exposure to herbicide agents.  See PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).

In summary, the Veteran's diabetes, hypertension, and heart disabilities are all presumed to have been caused by his exposure to herbicide agents during service.  The Board also finds that there is no evidence to rebut the presumption of exposure to herbicide agents in service.

For the foregoing reasons, service connection for diabetes, hypertension, and heart disability are granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral plantar fibromas is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral foot disability is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the May 2023 rating decision on appeal.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) did not obtain an adequate medical opinion prior to the rating decision on appeal.  

VA's duty to assist also includes obtaining a medical examination or opinion when such is necessary to decide on the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).  An examination or medical opinion is necessary if the evidence of record (1) contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability, or persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability; and (2) establishes that the claimant suffered an event, injury, or disease in service; or has a presumptive disease or symptoms of such a disease manifesting during an applicable presumptive period; and (3) indicates that the claimed disability or symptoms may be associated with the established event, injury, or disease in service; but (4) does not contain sufficient medical evidence for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.  Id.; see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

With respect to the claim of service connection for a bilateral foot disability, the statutory duty to assist has been triggered, as the Veteran contended that his current bilateral plantar fibromas are causally related to his service, to include exposure to herbicide agents.  He has not yet been afforded an examination for this claim.

The Board thus finds that the Veteran should be afforded an appropriate examination with respect to his service connection claim for a bilateral foot disability.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination by a VA clinician to determine the nature and etiology of his bilateral plantar fibromas.  The clinician should review the virtual file.  The clinician is to address whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that bilateral plantar fibromas was caused by the Veteran's service, to include conceded exposure to herbicide agents in service.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for his or her opinion(s) in the examination report.  The examiner must also discuss the possibility of the Veteran's service, other than exposure to herbicide agents, being the cause of the Veteran's bilateral foot disability.  If any of the above requested opinions cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner must state this and provide a rationale for such conclusion.
