CONCLUSION OF LAW

DM have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 2012 to February 2016.

This matter is on appeal from an August 2022 rating decision by a VA Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182 or "NOD") and selected the hearing docket.

In a September 2024 statement (before a Board hearing was scheduled), the Veteran explicitly and unambiguously indicated that he wished to withdraw his September 12, 2022, NOD appealing the August 2022 rating decision. 

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the issues in the August 2022 rating decision the appeal is dismissed. See 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.
