REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses incurred on June 12, 2024, to July 30, 2024. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1977 to February 2003. He has been 100 percent disabled since September 2021, plus in receipt of special monthly compensation (SMC). 

This decision has been written under the guidelines of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In September 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim. That same month, the Veteran appealed to the Board via a Form 10182 and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

The Veteran asserts that he was denied travel expenses for travel to a medical facility for radiation treatment appointments. He stated that he was told by the VA Medical Center staff to file his claims for travel reimbursement at the end of his radiation treatment appointments.

Turning to the relevant laws and regulations, payment or reimbursement for beneficiary travel may be authorized under 38 C.F.R. §§ 70.1-70.50. See also 38 U.S.C. § 111. VA will approve payment for beneficiary travel if the travel was made to obtain care or services for a person who is eligible for beneficiary travel payments under 38 C.F.R. § 70.10. Eligible persons include veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more who travel to or from a VA facility or VA-authorized health care facility for examination, treatment, or care for any condition. 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a)(2).

A claimant must apply for payment of beneficiary travel within 30 calendar days after completing beneficiary travel that does not include a special mode of transportation. 38 C.F.R. § 70.20(b).

In this case, the claims file does not contain all of the records considered by the AOJ in the decision on appeal. The September 2024 decision letters state that the claims for reimbursement for beneficiary travel on June 12, 2024, to July 30, 2024, were denied because the appointments were marked as not completed and the request for payment consideration was received greater than 30 calendar days from the date that the Veteran completed the travel associated with the appointment or the date that he became administratively eligible for payment of Beneficiary Travel benefits. 

The September 2024 decision letters also noted that the evidence relied on included patient medical records, but the file does not include the Veteran's complete medical records for the relevant period of time. VA internal documents show that the mileage/reimbursement was approved for $11.49. It is not clear whether he was in fact approved and received the beneficiary travel benefits for the June 12, 2024, to July 30, 2024, appointments. 

Due process requires that the AOJ ensure that a copy of the record before it is made available for the Board's review in connection with the appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (requiring the Secretary to consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case). The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating a veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Accordingly, on remand, the records should be obtained and associated with the claims file.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Associate with the electronic claim file all evidence considered in connection with the claim on appeal.

2. The record should include (but is not limited to): the records cited in the September 2024 decision, including the Veteran's medical records, and any other relevant documents received or generated in connection with the claim.

3. If any such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the appellant with notice of the unavailability of records.

4. Provide appropriate notice of the decision under 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b) to the Veteran.
