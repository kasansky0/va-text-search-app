ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for alcohol use disorder as a complication of service-connected generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with unspecified bipolar related disorder is granted. 

Entitlement to an effective date of May 6, 2021 for the 100 percent rating for GAD with unspecified bipolar related disorder and alcohol use disorder is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits. 

The appeal as to entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's alcohol use disorder is due to or a complication of service-connected psychiatric disorder. 

2. In February 2020, VA continued a 50 percent rating for GAD; the Veteran did not elect an administrative review option within one year following. 

3. On May 6, 2021, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim which was continuously pursued; the evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's psychiatric disorder with alcohol use disorder was manifested by total occupational and social impairment at the time this claim was filed. 

4. Considering the grants herein, the Veteran is assigned a total schedular rating during the entirety of the period for review; he does not have additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, and the issue of TDIU is moot. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for secondary service connection for alcohol use disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

2. The criteria for an effective date of May 6, 2021, and no earlier, for a 100 percent rating for service-connected psychiatric disorder with alcohol use disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.130, Diagnostic Codes 9400, 9432.

3. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal concerning entitlement to TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2009 to May 2011. 

This appeal stems from rating decisions issued in September 2023 and January 2024. In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As concerns the earlier effective date for a 100 percent rating, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. Regarding TDIU, the Board may only consider evidence at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the respective AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Neither the appellant nor representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist. See Scott v McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to duty to assist argument).

1. Entitlement to service connection for alcohol use disorder

In September 2023, VA confirmed and continued the previous denial of service connection for alcohol dependency. The March 2024 Form 10182 does not specifically list this issue; however, when referencing the rating assigned for psychiatric disorder, it refers to multiple hospitalizations since 2019. The Board observes that the hospitalizations were alcohol related and finds the issue within the scope of claim and for consideration herein. See Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188 (2021). 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Compensation shall not be paid if a disability is the result of a Veteran's own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs. 38 U.S.C. §§ 105, 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.301. VA's General Counsel has confirmed that direct service connection for a disability that is a result of a claimant's own abuse of alcohol or drugs is precluded for purposes of all VA benefits for claims filed after October 31, 1990. See VAOPGCPREC 7-99; 64 Fed. Reg. 52375 (1999); Allen v. Principi, 237 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The exception, as explained in Allen, is when a disability like alcohol or drug abuse is secondary to an already service-connected disability. 

In March 2012, a VA examiner opined that the diagnosed alcohol dependence preceded service and was not caused by it. While the Veteran reported that alcohol consumption increased significantly during service and he attributed it to a means of coping with anxiety and panic attacks, the examiner found this explanation self-serving. 

A private discharge summary dated in March 2021 indicates the Veteran has a history of chronic alcoholism due to his underlying psychiatric disorder with anxiety and depression. 

In June 2021, a VA examiner indicated that the symptoms of GAD and alcohol use could be partially differentiated; however, the two conditions can exacerbate one another, which prohibits separating their effects in any definitive manner. 

In August 2021, another VA examiner indicated that it was possible to differentiate the symptoms of GAD and alcohol use but that it was not possible to differentiate the impairment caused by each disorder. He further opined that any changes in severity or increase in the Veteran's distress is a direct result of his alcohol use and being in a relatively rapid cycle of hospitalization for detox and subsequent relapse. The symptoms from alcohol withdrawal are closely related to the anxiety symptoms. 

The Veteran most recently underwent a VA examination in August 2023. The examiner indicated that the symptoms of the various disorders could be differentiated but given the potential secondary nature of/potential mutual exacerbation, it was difficult to differentiate impairment without resorting to mere speculation. The examiner stated that alcohol dependency cannot be directly service connected. However, the alcohol use disorder and sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic use disorder is likely secondary to his service-connected psychiatric disorder. In support, the examiner cited medical research indicating the disorders are frequently comorbid, mutually exacerbating, and often co-occur. Further, alcohol may be used in an attempt to self-medicate.

On review, the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's alcohol use disorder is due to or a complication of his service-connected psychiatric disorders. Resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, secondary service connection is warranted for alcohol use disorder. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. The Board observes that the sedative use disorder documented on the examination is in sustained remission. 

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for a 100 percent rating for service-connected psychiatric disorders

In September 2023, VA increased the rating for GAD to 100 percent from August 30, 2023. The Veteran appealed this decision to the Board. In the March 2024 Form 10182, the attorney argued that VA erred by assigning the effective date from the date of examination. He further argued that the Veteran has been hospitalized multiple times since May 2019 and that he is entitled to a total rating from May 6, 2021 due to continuous pursuit. 

The general rule with respect to the effective date for an award of increased compensation is that the effective date of an award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An exception to that rule applies under circumstances where evidence demonstrates factually ascertainable increase in disability during the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation. In that situation, the law provides that the effective date of the award shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). In all other cases, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).

Continuous pursuit of a claim or an issue can be achieved by timely and properly filing an appropriate review option, generally within one year of an AMA decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c). 

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). For the period prior to March 24, 2015, a "claim" or "application" is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). An informal claim is any communication indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits. The benefit being sought must be identified. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Effective March 24, 2015, the law no longer allows for informal claims, but the pertinent regulation allows a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

As is relevant, in November 2016, VA increased the rating for GAD to 30 percent from August 29, 2016. The Veteran did not appeal this decision and new and material evidence was not received within the one-year appeal period. Thus, the decision is final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

In April 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ requesting a mental health convalescent increase. In May 2019, VA increased the rating for GAD to 50 percent effective April 23, 2019. On December 4, 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. In February 2020, VA continued the 50 percent rating for GAD and denied TDIU. The Veteran did not elect an administrative review option within one year. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

On May 6, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. In July 2021, VA increased the rating for GAD to 70 percent from June 28, 2021, and denied entitlement to a temporary total evaluation (TTE). Thereafter in July 2021, the Veteran submitted a Form 21-526EZ and a Form 21-8940. In November 2021, VA proposed to reduce the rating for GAD to 30 percent and denied TDIU. In May 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review (HLR) with the November 2021 decision. In June 2022, VA denied TDIU. In July 2022, the Veteran submitted an HLR request with the July 2021 decision. In August 2022, VA denied TTE. In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim and in December 2022, VA denied service connection for alcohol dependency and entitlement to TTE. In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim with the December 2022 rating. In May 2023, VA confirmed the previous denial of service connection for alcohol dependency and for TTE. In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim with the July 2022 denial of TDIU. Also in July 2023, the Veteran submitted an HLR request with the May 2023 decision. In August 2023, VA found duty to assist errors, and in September 2023, VA denied TTE but increased the rating for GAD to 100 percent from August 30, 2023. 

There is significant overlap between the issues of increased rating for psychiatric disorder, and entitlement to TTE and TDIU based on same. The Board further observes that under certain circumstances, a VA Form 21-8940 can be a supplemental claim. See Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (Vet. App. Mar. 13, 2025). 

In this case, the Veteran filed a Form 21-8940 indicating that he was unable to work due to GAD. This was within one year of the July 2021 rating that addressed the evaluation for GAD. Accordingly, the Board finds that continuous pursuit applies, and the appeal stems from the May 6, 2021 supplemental claim. 

Considering the grant above, the Board will consider the Veteran's alcohol use disorder in determining when there was a factually ascertainable increase in his psychiatric disorder. 

Pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 100 percent rating is assigned when there is total occupational and social impairment due to symptoms such as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Codes 9400, 9432.

The AOJ assigned the 100 percent rating effective August 23, 2023, which is the date of a VA examination showing total occupational and social impairment. 

The June 2021 VA examination indicates occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity which is consistent with a 50 percent rating. The August 2021 VA examination indicates occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks which is consistent with a 30 percent rating. Evidence of record also suggests that the Veteran had started a business selling items on eBay. 

Review of private treatment records, however, shows the Veteran had multiple hospitalizations during the period for review related to alcohol use with significant impairment in functioning. The records also reflect severe psychotic symptoms to include auditory hallucinations due to withdrawal symptoms. 

A July 2021 letter from a VA psychologist indicates that the Veteran's mental health disorder has led to social isolation, anxiety and depression with poor motivation and accompanying auditory and visual hallucinations. Paranoid delusions are present which impair his daily functioning and his ability to relate to others. The Veteran has trouble discerning hallucinations from reality. A December 2021 letter from the VA psychologist indicates that the Veteran's mental health condition has deteriorated at an alarming rate over the last year, and he is experiencing severe psychosocial as well as occupational impairment. She further stated that when she first met him in 2019, his presentation was much more well-organized. A February 2022 letter reflects similar information. 

An April 2023 VA note indicates that a social worker conducted a home visit. The Veteran reported he had not showered in 3 weeks, and he smelled of alcohol. The unit was filthy and in deplorable condition. 

While there is information indicating that the Veteran was trying to run an online business, the overall evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's psychiatric disorder with alcohol use was manifested by total occupational and social impairment at the time of the May 2021 claim. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, a 100 percent rating is assigned effective May 6, 2021. 

The Board acknowledges the VA psychologist letter indicating the Veteran's presentation was much more organized in 2019. Notwithstanding, and considering the multiple hospitalizations starting in approximately May 2019 to include the level of impairment reflected in corresponding private records, the Board finds that the correct effective date is based on date of claim. Thus, an earlier date is not warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). 

3. Entitlement to TDIU

In January 2024, VA denied entitlement to TDIU. The Veteran appealed this decision to the Board. Considering the procedural history discussed above, the period for review is from May 6, 2021 to the rating decision on appeal. 

Considering the grants herein, the Veteran is now assigned a total schedular rating during the entirety of the period for review. The Board acknowledges that it is not categorically true that the assignment of a total schedular rating renders an individual unemployability claim moot. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008) (holding that there could be a situation where a veteran has a schedular total rating for a particular service-connected disability and could establish a rating based on individual unemployability for another service-connected disability in order to qualify for special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) by having an "additional" disability of 60 percent or more ("housebound" rate)).

The Veteran is service connected for psychiatric disorders and right and left elbow disorders. He does not assert, nor is there any evidence to suggest his elbow disorders are so severe as to preclude all forms of substantially gainful employment. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. Rather, he argues he cannot work due to his psychiatric issues.

?

Even if TDIU was established based solely on the Veteran's psychiatric disorder with alcohol use, he does not have additional disabilities of 60 percent to qualify for an award of SMC at the housebound rate. Accordingly, the Board finds that the issue of TDIU is moot in this appeal stream. Thus, the appropriate course is to dismiss the appeal. See Furtick v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 293, 297 (2021).
