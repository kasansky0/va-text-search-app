ORDER

Service connection for lumbar spine fusion L5-S1 is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's back disability began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for lumbar spine fusion L5-S1 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2002 to November 2008.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2023 decision. In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2023 decision.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran submitted the claim on appeal using a signed VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits. The complete VA Form 21-526EZ includes 'Notice to Veteran/Service Member of Evidence Necessary to Substantiate a Claim for Veterans Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.' This part of the form contains explicit notice to the claimant that "You are entitled to a hearing at any time in the claims process. If you wish to have a hearing or have other questions, contact VA online through Ask VA: https://ask.va.gov or call us toll-free at 1-800-827-1000 (TTY:711)." By signing the VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran certified they received the notice attached to their application titled, Notice to Veteran/Service Member of Evidence Necessary to Substantiate a Claim for Veterans Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits. Therefore, the Board finds that he was provided with notice of his right to a hearing before the AOJ issued its initial decision on appeal.

1. Service connection for lumbar spine fusion L5-S1 is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for lumbar spine fusion L5-S1. He contends he was injured on active duty. See October 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

On August 10, 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was enacted. The PACT Act provides, in relevant part, that the VA has certain duty-to-assist requirements for veterans determined to have been involved in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA.) See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (f).

Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence of record. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (VA must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence). The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claims. The Veteran must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000).

In the October 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found the Veteran has a diagnosed back disability (i.e., he underwent a lumbar spine fusion on September24, 2019, at Twin Cities Hospital) and had complaints of back pain during service in February 2006. Therefore, the question for the Board is whether the Veteran's current disability began during service or is otherwise at least as likely as not related to his in-service back pain.

The Veteran's October 2002 enlistment report of medical examination reflects a normal clinical evaluation of the 'spine, other musculoskeletal.' His October 2002 enlistment report of medical history also indicates that he denied a history of arthritis, rheumatism, or bursitis; recurrent back pian or any back problems; swollen or painful joints; and bone, joint, or other deformity. 

A February 2006 service treatment record notes pinpoint tenderness over the center of mid/lower back for two weeks. The Veteran denied any known injury, weakness, radiating symptoms, and numbness/tingling. The clinician indicated that x-ray showed no fracture or dislocation. The complaint was assessed as midback pain. A February 2006 physical profile serial report reflects temporary duty restrictions due to back pain. 

An October 2008 report of medical assessment indicates the Veteran reported his overall health is better compared to his last medical assessment/physical examination. He denied suffering from any injury or illness while on active duty for which he did not seek medical care. He also denied taking any medications or having any conditions which limit his ability to work in his primary military specialty or require geographic or assigment limitations. 

A September 2014 post-service private treatment record indicates the Veteran complained of low back pain for two weeks that began as he was getting out of his truck. The Veteran reported a history of similar symptoms previously at age 18 or 19. The clinician assessed the complaint as acute lumbar sacral myofascial strain.

July 2019 private treatment records note back pain and seizing. A July 2019 x-ray series demonstrated maintained vertebral body heights, intact pedicles, maintained disc spaces, and preserved lumbar curvature. An August 2019 private magnetic resonance imagining report (MRI) notes broad-based central disc herniation at L5-S1 with bilateral neural foraminal encroachment.  

An August 2019 private treatment record also indicates the Veteran was referred for evaluation of severe lower back pain/bilateral leg pain/radiculopathy. The clinician indicated the Veteran has been having pain since 1998. The clinician also indicated that imaging shows some degenerative changes at the L5-S1 with some facet arthrosis and darkened disc L5-S1 with annular tear, centralized and foraminal stenosis, primary facet arthrosis, and degenerative discs.

A September 2019 private treatment record also indicates the Veteran has been symptomatic since 1998. 

The Veteran's September 2019 operative report indicates the Veteran had advanced lumbar spondylosis at L5-S1, lower back pain, bilateral leg radiculopathy, foraminal stenosis, central stenosis, and bilateral sacroiliitis. The physician indicated a posterior spinal fusion at L5-S1 was performed. The physician also noted that the Veteran has been symptomatic since 1988 with progressive symptoms that are affecting his quality of life and activity. 

A July 2020 private treatment record indicates the Veteran has had lower back pain 'for many years' but denies specific antecedent trauma. July 2020 private treatment records reflect diagnoses of low back pain, degenerative spondylosis, sacroiliitis, postlaminectomy syndrome, and lumbar radiculopathy. 

In September 2020, the Veteran reported sudden onset of back pain for eight weeks. He also reported a history of chronic and recurrent lower back injury from his military service.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in December 2020. The examiner diagnosed fusion lumbar spine L5-S1. During the examination, the Veteran reported an episode of acute lower back pain in July 2019. He denied any trauma but reported continued low back pain symptoms that wax and wane. The December 2020 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's back disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by service. The examiner found that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim because there is no evidence for low back injury or chronic back symptoms during service. The examiner acknowledged that a February 2006 service treatment record notes an acute complaint of mid-back pain but found that it is anatomically unrelated to his current back diagnosis. Finally, the examiner noted that the Veteran's May 2006 and August 2007 health assessments were negative.

In January 2022, the Veteran submitted an article from Sports Health titled "Underreporting of Musculoskeletal Injuries in the US Army." The article indicates that the purpose of the article is to evaluate injury reporting among active duty U.S. Army soldiers. Ultimately, the study purports to find that approximately half of musculoskeletal injuries in a Bridge Combat Team were not reported.

A September 2022 VA mental health crisis intervention note indicates the Veteran reported suffering a back injury in service.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in February 2023. The examiner diagnosed spinal fusion. In SECTION II - MEDICAL HISTORY, the examiner acknowledged the complaint of back pain in 2006 and also that the Veteran reported to her that he had continued back pain. In SECTION III - MEDICAL OPINION FOR DIRECT SERVICE CONNECTION, however, the examiner opined that the Veteran's back disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by service.  Her stated rationale was that service treatment records show no evaluations, treatments, diagnoses or procedures of the Veteran's back, including the L5-S1 spinal Fusion. She further stated that her rationale was also that "there is no evidence in the STR indicating the veteran has any complaints, treatments or diagnoses during his period of service (2002-2008) or within a year of having left service. No diagnosis."

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted an article from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons titled "Back Pain and Spine Disorders in U.S. Veterans." The article indicates that one in four adults suffer from chronic low back pain and that spine impairment can be a leading cause of disability for the Veteran population. Specifically, the article notes that previous studies have demonstrated "long-term musculoskeletal disability in military personnel." 

The Veteran also submitted an article from Houston Methodist's On Health titled "Lower Back Pain Causes: 8 Reasons for Sudden & Chronic Pain." The article indicates that straining a muscle or spraining a ligament are the most common causes of lower back pain. The article indicates other causes of back pain include herniated disk, facet joint damage, compression fracture, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and scoliosis. 

The Veteran also submitted an article from Spine Epidemiology titled "The Incidence of Low Back Pain in Active Duty United States Military Service Members." The article purports to investigate the incidence and risk factors for developing low back pain in the active duty military population. The article concluded that female sex; enlisted rank groups; service in the Army, Navy, or Air Force; age greater than 40 years; and a marital status of married were all risk factors for low back pain. 

The Veteran also submitted an article from Chiropractic & Manual Therapies titled "Risk Factors for low back pain in active military personnel: a systemic review." The article purports to find that prior history of low back pain, previous musculoskeletal injury, less time in physical training, female sex, and lower rank were consistent risk factors for low back pain.

An addendum VA opinion was obtained in August 2023. The examiner opined that the Veteran's back disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by service. The examiner acknowledged the Veteran's service treatment records indicate he was seen in February 2006 for back pain but noted his October 2008 separation reports did not reveal history or physical exam findings for ongoing acute or chronic treatment of back pain or a back condition. The examiner also noted that the reviewed medical records did not reveal continuous ongoing medical treatment or aggravation of acute or chronic conditions from discharge to present day. Finally, the examiner found that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability is secondary to joint aging and chronic overuse of the lumbar spine over many years and is independent from his active military career.  

In November 2022 correspondence, the Veteran's representative stated that the Veteran had chronic back pain that continued throughout his service to today. He stated further that back pain is tolerable, and it is reasonable, in light of military culture, that he would simply tolerate it rather than seek treatment. 

In September 2024, the Veteran's representative asserted that the VA examinations of record explicitly relied on a lack of medical treatment records in service. Therefore, the Veteran's representative contends that the rationales are inadequate. 

After a review of the evidentiary record, the Board finds there is a question as to whether the claimed back disability preexisted the Veteran's military service from November 2002 to November 2008.

The presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury not noted upon entry to service manifests in service, and a question arises as to whether it preexisted service. Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 55 (2012), aff'd 749 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2014). In this case, the Veteran's appeal is based on the period of active duty from November 2002 to November 2008. However, the record indicates the Veteran has alternatively reported onset of his back symptoms in 1988, 1996, 1997, and/or 1998. 

The Veteran's October 2002 entrance examination is absent of any notations of defects, infirmities, or disorders of the back. Additionally, the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether a back disability manifested during service. A February 2006 service treatment record reflects midback pain. Therefore, with respect to the Veteran's current back disability, the presumption of soundness attaches. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b). Because the presumption of soundness attaches with respect to this disability, there must be clear and unmistakable evidence that the disorder both pre-existed service and was not aggravated in service. Id; see also Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

Clear and unmistakable evidence is defined as obvious or manifest. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b). Clear and unmistakable evidence means that the evidence "'cannot be misinterpreted and misunderstood, i.e., it is undebatable.'" Quirin v Shinski, 22 Vet. App. 390, 396 (2009).  

The most competent and credible evidence of record illustrates that the Veteran's back disability did not clearly and unmistakably preexist service. The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for a back disability or back symptoms prior to his February 2006 in-service complaint of midback pain. He specifically denied a history of recurrent back pain or any back problems on his enlistment report of medical history, and he was found to have a normal clinical evaluation of the spine on his enlistment report of medical examination. Moreover, the Veteran only reported two weeks of lower back pain in February 2006 and denied any known injury. Furthermore, the Veteran's reports of onset of his back pain are internally inconsistent as he has reported symptoms since approximately 1988, 1996, 1997, 1998, and/or 2006. 

Therefore, the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted. When VA fails to carry its burden as to either preexistence or lack of aggravation, whether and to what extent the Veteran is entitled to compensation for the injury would be determined upon the assumption that the injury was incurred during service. However, it does not necessarily follow that an unrebutted presumption of soundness will lead to service connection for the disease or injury.  The Veteran must still demonstrate a current disability and a nexus between the current disability and the injury or disease in service. Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 233 (2012).

In this case, while the Veteran has a currently diagnosed lumbar spine disability, and evidence shows that in-service back pain occurred, the Board concludes that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's currently diagnosed lumbar spine disability began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

VA and private treatment records show the Veteran was not diagnosed with a lumbar spine disability until 2014, years after separation from service. While the Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of back pain intermittently since service, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that these symptoms were manifestations of his currently diagnosed back disability. The issue is medically complex, as it requires interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

Moreover, to the extent the Veteran or his representative reports onset and continuity of back pain symptoms since service, the Board finds such reports not credible. Such reports of onset are internally inconsistent with the evidentiary record as he has alternatively reported back symptoms since approximately 1988, 1996, 1997, 1998, and/or 2006. Similarly, the reported of continuity since service are inconsistent with other contemporaneous evidence of record, specifically his service treatment records and post-service medical records, which are silent for complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to a lumbar spine disability from 2006 to 2014. 

The Board acknowledges that the absence of evidence does not automatically constitute substantive negative evidence. Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011). In order to find that silence in the record contradicts lay testimony, the Board "must first establish a proper foundation for drawing inferences against a claimant from an absence of documentation." Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015) (citing Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 239, n.7 (2012)). Such a foundation may be laid by a finding that the fact at issue would ordinarily have been recorded, in which case, the Board may legitimately infer from the absence of such a record that it did not occur.

In this case, the Board finds that there is sufficient foundation to infer from the silence in the Veteran's service treatment records and post-service records that he did not continue to have back problems after his 2006 complaint of back pain during service. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 440 (2011); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015). The service treatment records are not merely silent for a back disability after 2006; instead, his service treatment records reflect complaints for a number of other medical conditions throughout service including for other health concerns such as a left ankle sprain. See September 2008 service treatment record. Yet, they are negative for any complaints or findings of an ongoing back symptoms or problems. Additionally, in October 2008, the Veteran affirmatively denied suffering from any injury or illness while on active duty for which he did not seek medical care.

The Veteran believes the claimed back disability is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. In this case, he is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue. The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of anatomical relationships and interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran because the record does not show that he has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the August 2023 VA addendum opinion.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's representative's contention that the VA opinions of record rely on the lack of medical treatment records in service such that they are inadequate. The Board finds that the February 2023 VA opinion is indeed inadequate because it is internally inconsistent. The Board will not rely on this opinion. However, the Board finds the August 2023 addendum opinion is supported by an adequate rationale. The August 2023 VA examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). The examiner did not rely solely on the absence of evidence but rather found the Veteran's lumbar spine disability is secondary to joint aging and chronic overuse of the lumbar spine over many years and is independent from his active military career. 

There is no competent medical evidence of record associating the Veteran's current back disability with his active duty service, including the complaint of pain in 2006. To the extent the submitted medical literature was intended to establish a medical nexus, the Board finds that the generic literature is of limited probative value. Generally, a medical article or treatise can be probative evidence when combined with an opinion of a medical professional if the medical article or treatise deals with generic relationships with a degree of certainty such that, under the facts of a specific case, there is at least "plausible causality" based upon objective facts rather than on an unsubstantiated lay medical opinion. Mattern v. West, 12 Vet. App. 222, 228 (1999). Here, the articles cited are not sufficient to support a causal nexus to service. They are not combined with an opinion of a medical professional and do not pertain specifically to the Veteran's circumstances and clinical history. As such, the medical literature is not probative. 

Finally, the Board acknowledges that Section 303 of the PACT Act provides that, if a Veteran submits a claim for service connection with evidence of disability and evidence of participation in a TERA, then VA shall obtain a medical opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that there is a nexus between the disability and the toxic exposure risk activity. 38 U.S.C. § 1168. While the VA has an obligation to provide a VA examination for a qualifying service connection claim which cannot be otherwise granted where there is evidence of a TERA, sub-regulatory guidance has specified four situations in which an exception applies including non-presumptive claims based on physical trauma.

In this case, although the record indicates the Veteran participated in a TERA (through his exposure to asbestos, industrial solvents, mineral fiber, and fuels), the examination requirements do not apply if the Secretary determines there is no indication of an association between the disability claimed by the Veteran and the TERA. Thus, the Board finds that an exception to the TERA examination requirements applies, and an additional examination is not warranted on this basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (b); VBA Letter 20-22-10, 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for a lumbar spine disability is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
