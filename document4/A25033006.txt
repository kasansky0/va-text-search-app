DOCKET NO. 240729-458912
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

There is no decision of record addressing the issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that may be properly appealed pursuant to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA); the issue of entitlement to service connection for OSA was properly addressed under a different docket pursuant to the regulations governing the Legacy appeals process upon the Appellant's substitution in that case.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish and pursue an appeal pursuant to the AMA have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 201, 202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 1972 to June 1976. The Veteran died in September 2022.

The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse, and the Board has found that substitution has been properly granted in the claim for OSA that was pending at the time of the Veteran's death because the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection to the Appellant for the cause of the Veteran's death in a rating decision in September 2023.

The substantive claim that was pending at the time of the Veteran's death was dismissed by the Board in October 2022. With the determination that substitution was proper, the Appellant has been substituted in that cause which was decided pursuant to the Board's legacy docket in a separate decision. That decision was fully favorable.

With regard to this docket, this matter purportedly comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of the September 2023 rating decision just discussed.

In July 2024, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision that is purportedly on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for OSA.

As discussed above, the substantive matter was before the Board at the time of the Veteran's death in September 2022. The Board dismissed the appeal in October 2022. In March 2023, the Appellant submitted a request for substitution and a claim for benefits for the cause of the Veteran's death. In September 2023, the AOJ granted the Appellant service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death. However, at the time of that decision, a determination on the matter of substitution had not been made. Similarly, the September 2023 decision did not address the issue of entitlement to service connection for OSA that had been on appeal at the time of the Veteran's death.

The Appellant submitted the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, seeking entitlement to OSA with reference to the September 2023 decision. However, as that decision did not contain a decision on the issue the Appellant seeks to appeal, the Board finds that the July 2024 VA Form 10182 is not adequate to begin an appeal.

VA regulations provide that an appeal must begin with a Notice of Disagreement from a decision by the AOJ. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. The Notice of Disagreement must be on a prescribed form and must identify the specific decision and issue (or issues) therein with which a claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. 7105; 38 C.F.R. 20.202(a). Where an appeal fails to identify a specific determination with which the claimant disagrees, the Board may dismiss the appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).

Here, as discussed above, the Appellant has identified the decision purportedly on appeal as the September 2023 AOJ decision. That decision does not address the issue of entitlement to service connection for OSA. There is no decision on this issue addressed to the Appellant in the record. Thus, the Board finds that the Appellant has failed to identify a decision with which she disagrees, because there was no such decision issued in September 2023. 38 U.S.C. 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). Therefore, the appeal is dismissed as to this docket number. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).

The Board emphasizes that this dismissal is little more than a procedural matter. The Appellant chose an inapplicable method of attempting to get this matter to the Board when she filed her VA Form 10182 in July 2024. The substantive issue is appropriately before the Board in the legacy docket where the Appellant has been substituted as the claimant. That matter was also decided by the undersigned VLJ and was resolved in the Appellant's favor. Nothing in this dismissal should affect any benefits appropriately granted in that other docket. This matter is dismissed as to this docket upon the procedural grounds discussed above. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).
