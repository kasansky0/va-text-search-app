ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for bronchitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a February 2025 rating decision, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) granted service connection for IBS with an effective date of July 26, 2023; this is a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal.

2. The Veteran does not have a current disability of bronchitis.

3. The Veteran did not appear at his scheduled VA examination in August 2023 and has not provided good cause for why he did not report to his scheduled VA examination.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for IBS have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104, 20.205.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bronchitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1119, 1120, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.655. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2003 to March 2005, with a period of active duty training from June 2001 to September 2001.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

IBS - Dismissal

By way of procedural background, in February 2025, the RO granted entitlement to service connection to IBS with an effective date of July 26, 2023. As service connection for IBS is now currently in effect, the Board finds that this appeal is now moot.

The Board also acknowledges that in October 2024, the Veteran requested to withdraw the IBS claim. See October 2024 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. 

Accordingly, there is no case or controversy currently before the Board regarding IBS, and the appeal as to that claim is therefore dismissed.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in, or aggravated by, active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), exposure to burn pits and other toxins (BPOT) is presumed for "covered veterans," i.e., those who served in specific locations on or after specific dates. 38 U.S.C. § 1119. Any veteran who, on or after August 2, 1990, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in and/or airspace above Bahrain; Iraq; Kuwait; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Somalia; the United Arab Emirates; the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia; the Gulf of Aden; the Gulf of Oman; the Persian Gulf; the Arabian Sea; or the Red Sea will be presumed BPOT exposed, as will any veteran who, on or after September 11, 2001, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in and/or airspace above Afghanistan; Djibouti; Egypt; Jordan; Lebanon; Syria; Yemen; or Uzbekistan. 38 U.S.C. § 1119; VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 7, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022). Certain diseases will be presumed related to service for veterans with in-service toxic exposure, including BPOT exposure. 38 U.S.C. § 1120.

When entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination or reexamination, the claim shall be rated based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b). Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant, or death of an immediate family member. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a).

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. See Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992); Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164 (1991). Equal weight is not necessarily accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; not every item of evidence necessarily has the same probative value.

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Bronchitis - Evidence and Analysis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for bronchitis. Specifically, he argues that because of his service in Iraq and exposure to burn pits he now has constant bronchitis. See July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Here, the AOJ made the following favorable findings. First, the Veteran served in Iraq and Kuwait during the period of service of December 2003 to March 2005. See DD-214. Second, the Veteran has sufficient service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection. See January 2023 VA Memo. Third, the Veteran was exposed to burn pits during his military service. See March 2023 Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum. The Board is bound by these prior favorable AOJ findings as they are not clearly and unmistakably erroneous. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The record shows that the Veteran failed to report to his examination. The Veteran's availability for an examination was confirmed both by email and by telephone, an appointment notification was sent out by email and by courier, and an appointment reminder was sent out by email. See August 2023 C&P Exam - Veteran Contact History. Despite this, the Veteran did not report to his examination.

The Veteran has not provided evidence of good cause for his failure to report to the scheduled VA examination, and there is no indication that he requested that the examination be rescheduled. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655. In the October 2024 VA Form 10182 the Veteran simply stated that he had missed the medical exam and that he needed another examination. The Board emphasizes that the duty to assist and provide the Veteran with a VA examination is a two-way street, and due to his failure to report for the VA examination and provide good cause for his failure to do so or provide a date for which he is able to complete the examination, there is no further duty to schedule any additional VA examinations relating to his claim. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).

In accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b), the Board will proceed with the record before it. Based on a review of the record, which includes the service treatment records (STR) and VA treatment records, service connection for bronchitis is not warranted. 

Here, the Veteran served in Iraq and Kuwait from during the period from December 2003 to March 2005. Accordingly, the Veteran is a "covered veteran" with presumed BPOT exposure under 38 U.S.C. § 1119. As such, presumptive service connection will be warranted for diseases enumerated in 38 U.S.C. § 1120. Chronic bronchitis is an enumerated disease. 

However, a thorough review of the record fails to show that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of chronic bronchitis. The Board notes that in November 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for Respiratory Conditions (Other Than Tuberculosis and Sleep Apnea), where his diagnoses of asthma and restrictive lung disease were confirmed. There was no notation or documentation of the Veteran having a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis or any other respiratory diagnosis. The Board notes that in April 2023 the Veteran was afforded an examination for Sinusitis/Rhinitis and Other Conditions of the Nose, Throat, Larynx and Pharynx where his diagnoses of chronic sinusitis and deviated nasal septum (traumatic) were confirmed. There was no documentation of the Veteran having a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis. The Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for sleep apnea with asthma and chronic cough, chronic sinusitis, and allergic rhinitis.

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms he experiences first-hand, such as coughing, but as a lay person he is not competent to medically relate them to service or diagnose bronchitis. Moreover, there is no medical evidence to even suggest that his reported symptoms have resulted in functional impairment of earning capacity during the appeal period. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

Indeed, the Veteran's failure to report to the scheduled VA examination deprived the Board of evidence that would have possibly been favorable to his claim. In the absence of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

The evidence is persuasively against the claim, and as such the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application). The appeal is therefore denied.
