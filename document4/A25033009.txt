REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a left leg scar is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty for training (ADT) from October 2006 to May 2007, and on active duty from December 2007 to March 2009 and from July 2009 to July 2010. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2023. In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board acknowledges that additional issues were listed on the February 2024 Form 10182. As concerns service connection for voiding dysfunction, the Veteran filed a Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim on this issue in October 2023. This predates the Form 10182 and thus, is not for consideration due to prohibited concurrent election. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). 

As concerns the remaining issues listed (service connection for burn scars on neck, left and right arm numbness, and right and left leg sciatica and numbness; increased ratings for sinusitis, and right and left hip tendonitis; and entitlement to TDIU), the Veteran submitted a Form 10182 in May 2024 wherein she elected the evidence submission docket. This is a valid and timely docket switch request. In March 2025, the Board granted the request, and these issues were placed in the evidence submission docket. Thus, they are not for consideration in this Direct Review docket decision and will be addressed in a separate decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left leg scar 

In August 2023, VA denied service connection for a left leg scar. VA favorably found that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). The Veteran appealed this decision to the Board. She contends that her left leg was cut with a belt buckle during an in-service assault and that this resulted in a scar.  

Service treatment records do not document the claimed injury and medical evidence does not reflect a left leg scar. Notwithstanding, the Veteran is competent to report that her left leg was cut during service. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a lay person is competent to report on that of which she has personal knowledge). She is also competent to report a resulting scar. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (a Veteran is competent to report readily observable symptoms). In finding her competent to report this information, the Board makes no finding at this time concerning the credibility of the occurrence of the in-service event.

Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the requirements for a VA examination were met at the time of the rating decision on appeal. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). The Veteran was not provided an examination on this issue and a remand is needed to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). A TERA opinion is not needed as the Veteran attributes the scar to physical trauma. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b). 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of any left leg scar. The claims folder must be available for review. Please answer the following:

(a.) Does the Veteran have a current left leg scar?

(b.) For any current left leg scar identified, is it

1.	 consistent with the reported mechanism of injury (e.g., being cut with a belt buckle)?

2.	at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to an event in active service? Please remember that the Veteran is competent to describe the injury. If there is a medical basis to doubt the history as reported, the examiner should explain why.

A complete rationale must be provided for each opinion.
