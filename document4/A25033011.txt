ORDER

Entitlement to revision of the March 2016 rating decision that awarded an initial noncompensable rating for right shoulder strain (right shoulder disability), on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The correct facts, as known at the time, were before the VA adjudicators at the time of the March 2016 rating decision, and the statutory and regulatory provisions extant at the time were correctly applied, and there was no undebatable error, the commission of which manifestly changed the outcome of the decision regarding the initial noncompensable rating assigned for right shoulder disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for revision of a March 2016, rating decision with regard to the initial noncompensable rating assigned for right shoulder disability on the basis of clear and unmistakable error pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 have not been satisfied.  38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2010 to September 2015.

In February 2022, the AOJ concluded that no clear and unmistakable error occurred in the March 2016 rating decision that granted service connection for the right shoulder disability and assigned a noncompensable rating. That same month, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the February 2022 decision. In June 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2022 decision and continued its finding that there was no clear and unmistakable error in the March 2016 rating decision. 

The Veteran appealed the June 2022 HLR decision. In the July 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. In a Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, given that the appeal involves an allegation of CUE in the March 2016 rating decision, the Board is limited to review of evidence of record at the time of the March 2016 rating decision.

The Veteran contends that the March 2016 rating decision that assigned an initial noncompensable rating for the right shoulder disability contains CUE. Specifically, he argues that he should have received a 20 percent rating for his right shoulder strain based on painful motion under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, as 20 percent is the minimal compensable rating under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5201. He contends that his case falls under Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472 (2016) and Petitti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415 (2015), which he claims supports his contention. 

As a threshold matter, the Board finds that the arguments advanced by the Veteran allege CUE with the requisite specificity. See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003). The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of his claim

Within the March 2016 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for right shoulder strain and assigned a noncompensable disability rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5201. The Veteran did not file a timely notice of disagreement (NOD) challenging this determination and new and material evidence was not received within one year of the rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). Consequently, the March 2016 rating decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103. 

In February 2022, the Veteran filed a request for revision of the noncompensable rating assigned for his right shoulder disability on the basis of CUE in the March 2016 rating decision.  

Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105. CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error." It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE. Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error." Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993). In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different. Id. at 44.

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision, which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision. Id.

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered.  Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).  

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision. See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999). A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset. King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014). The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different. Id. at 442.

The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application in claims of CUE. Andrews v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 177, 186 (2004) (citing Russell, 3 Vet. App. at 313) (it is well established that the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine can never be applicable in assessing a CUE motion because the nature of such a motion is that it involves more than a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated).

At the time of the March 2016 rating decision, DC 5201 pertains to limitation of motion of the shoulder. A rating of 20 percent for either arm is assigned where motion is limited to shoulder level. Id. The Veteran in this case is right-handed.

The standard range of motion for shoulder abduction and forward elevation (flexion) is 180 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate I. Standard internal and external rotation is to 90 degrees, and "shoulder level" is equivalent to 90 degrees of shoulder flexion or abduction. Id.

In Petitti, 27 Vet. App. at 424, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) noted that § 4.59 "explain[s] how to arrive at proper evaluations under the DCs appearing in the disability rating schedule." Section 4.59 acknowledges that a claimant's disability may cause actual pain or painful motion, but still not be severe enough to warrant a compensable rating under the appropriate DC. Accordingly, when there is evidence of painful motion, § 4.59 operates to provide at least the minimum compensable rating available under the DC for the joint. Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472, 478 (2016); see also Petitti, 27 Vet. App. at 424-25.

While 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 adds flexibility to the rating schedule, it is also limited by the terms of the appropriate DC for the joint. Sowers, supra. Thus, if the appropriate DC for the joint does not provide a compensable rating, a claimant is not entitled to a minimum rating. Id. at 481 ("Section 4.59 may intend to compensate painful motion, but it does not guarantee a compensable rating."). Sowers highlights the importance of the DC under which the appellant is rated because § 4.59 operates within the parameters of the DC. Thus, the minimum disability rating for which the claimant may be eligible is dictated by the minimum disability rating available under the appropriate DC.

The evidence at the time of the March 2016 rating decision included a February 2016 VA shoulder examination report, which showed that the examiner diagnosed right shoulder strain. The Veteran reported during service in Afghanistan, he was doing heavy lifting both in the gym and at work and that he was lifting over head when he felt pain and tearing of the right shoulder. He reported that his condition had improved. His symptoms included popping with overhead lifting; soreness in the deltoid area after lifting. He reported increased pain with lifting overhead. The Veteran denied flare-ups. The examiner documented that the right shoulder had flexion to 180 degrees, abduction to 180 degrees, external rotation to 90 degrees, and internal rotation to 90 degrees. The examiner documented there was no pain on examination. There was no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue, and no loss of range of motion after 3 repetitions. The examiner concluded that the Veteran would not be limited in performing any occupational tasks. 

Notably, a March 2015 private treatment record noted the Veteran had full range of motion in the upper extremities with the exception of minimal stiffness in his right wrist. The Board further notes that the Veteran did not report right shoulder symptoms during service. Rather in May 2013, the Veteran reported left shoulder joint pain after performing an incline bench press with dumbbells that he described felt like a tear, and he felt slight popping afterwards. This is the same incident he described at the 2016 VA examination, except that he reported that this happened to his right shoulder at the examination, in contrast to the service treatment records, which show that this occurred to the left shoulder. 

Although it is clear that "[w]here an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance[,]" Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 57-58 (1994), the Board is also required to assess the veteran's disorder "in relation to its history" when assigning a disability rating for a veteran's disorder, see Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 4.2 (2017) ("It is the responsibility of the rating specialist to interpret reports of examination in the light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present."); see also Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293 (2013) (Board erred in failing to address recent pre-claim evidence in assessing whether a current disability existed, for purposes of service connection, at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency).

Based on this evidence, the RO, assigned a noncompensable rating based on no compensable symptoms. The RO noted that in every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 CFR § 4.31. The RO explained the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and § 4.45 concerning functional loss due to pain, fatigue, weakness, or lack of endurance, incoordination, and flare-ups, as cited in DeLuca v. Brown, infra. and Mitchell v. Shinseki, infra. have been considered and are not warranted and that a higher evaluation of 10 percent was not warranted for limitation of motion of the arm unless the evidence showed painful motion of the shoulder. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5201.

The Board finds that there is no CUE in the March 2016 rating decision in not assigning a compensable disability rating for the right shoulder disability.

When an evaluation of a disability is based on limitation of motion, the Board must also consider, in conjunction with the otherwise applicable diagnostic code, any additional functional loss the Veteran may have sustained by virtue of other factors as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206 (1995). As noted above, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 allows consideration of functional loss due to painful motion to be rated to at least the minimum compensable rating for a particular joint. Such factors include more or less movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, and deformity or atrophy of disuse. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 state that disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or inflammation in parts of the system, to perform normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance. A finding of functional loss due to pain must be supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.40; Johnston v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 80, 85 (1997).

Although pain may cause functional loss, pain itself does not constitute functional loss. Rather, pain must affect some aspect of "the normal working movements of the body," such as "excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," in order to constitute functional loss. Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 38-43 (2011) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40).

With any form of arthritis, painful motion is an important factor of disability. The intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability. Joints that are actually painful, unstable, or malaligned, due to healed injury, should be entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. Special note should be taken of objective indications of pain on pressure or manipulation, muscle spasm, crepitation, and active and passive range of motion of both the damaged joint and the opposite undamaged joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. Moreover, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. When § 4.59 is raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record, even in non-arthritis contexts, VA should address its applicability. Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 3-5 (2011). 

Although the RO did not explicitly discuss the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 within the rating decsion, the RO stated that the Veteran did not exhibit painful motion of the shoulder and therefore, a minimum of 10 percent rating was not warranted. It is apparent the RO considered whether 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 was applicable, as prior to May 23, 2016, VA interpreted "the minimum compensable rating" for a joint as a 10 percent rating, irrespective of the diagnostic code involved, as outlined in the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual as in effect at the time of the March 2016 rating decision. See VA Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1), Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, Section A, Topics 1(g) and 7(b) (2015). While the Board notes that the M21-1 is not binding on the Board, this portion is pertinent to consideration of the CUE claim in this decision given that the RO explained that the Veteran was not entitled to a 10 percent rating for his limitation of motion without evidence of painful motion and the RO applies the M21-1 to its decisions. Therefore, the RO determined the Veteran did not have a compensable loss of function in his right shoulder consistent with 38 C.F.R. 4.59 as interpreted prior to May 23, 2016 to warrant a compensable rating.  

Subsequently, in Sowers, 27 Vet. App. 472, the Court held that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is limited by the specific diagnostic code most applicable to the claimant's disability.  Although the Court did not specifically hold that the minimum compensable rating must be assigned under the applicable diagnostic code for the disability involved, the holding influenced subsequent VA policy to reflect that the minimum compensable rating under the specific diagnostic code for the joint involved must be assigned when painful motion is demonstrated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. This policy particularly affects painful motion of the shoulder evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5201, in which painful motion of the shoulder warrants the assignment of a 20 percent rating, the minimum compensable rating. As explicitly stated in the current version of the M21-1, this policy became effective May 23, 2016, after issuance of the March 2016 rating decision. See M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 1, Section A, Topic 1(g).

In light of the above and upon review of the evidence, the Board finds the evidence of record does not undebatably establish that the Veteran was entitled to a 20 percent rating for the service-connected right shoulder disability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. In this regard, within the February 2016 VA examination report, it shows that even though the Veteran reported pain in his right shoulder upon overhead lifting, during range of motion testing, he did not have any pain, as documented by the examiner. His range of motion testing was normal with forward flexion measured from 0 to 180 degrees. On abduction, he could abduct to 180 degrees, which is also normal. The 2016 VA examiner concluded that the Veteran had normal arm strength, bilaterally, to flexion and extension. The examiner noted shoulder joints were normal, bilaterally. He had normal range of motion with no pain throughout the entire range of motion, to include on repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions with no loss of range of motion or function. Despite the Veteran's report of increased pain with overhead lifting, the examiner concluded the Veteran was not prevented from performing any occupational tasks. Also, as noted above, the STRs shows that the Veteran reported left shoulder pain, as opposed to right shoulder pain, and the Veteran had full range of motion in his right shoulder without pain in the June 2015 private treatment record (during service).

A veteran experiencing an actually painful joint is entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint under the appropriate diagnostic code to the joint involved. In other words, section 4.59 does not require "objective" evidence of painful motion. If credible, lay testimony may consist of a veteran's own statements to the extent that the statements describe symptoms capable of lay observation. Petitti, 27 Vet. App. at 424-30. 

In this case, the RO weighed the evidence, to include the medical and lay evidence and reasonably determined that the Veteran's right shoulder symptoms did not result in functional loss factors. Thus, it determined the 2016 VA examination outweighed the Veteran's lay statements, statements that are contradicted by the service treatment records that documented left shoulder pain, as opposed to right shoulder pain. Thus, the RO reasonably concluded that the minimum compensable rating under the limitation of motion code pertaining to the affected right shoulder joint of 10 percent, which was the policy prior to May 23, 2016, was not warranted and found that the Veteran did not have compensable symptoms that resulted in "painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability" under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.59; 4.71a, DC 5201 (bold and italics added).

The Board finds that, based on the facts and law as they were known at the time of the March 2016 rating decision, the assignment of a noncompensable rating for right shoulder strain was supportable and was not CUE. In sum, the 2016 VA examiner documented that the Veteran had not reported pain upon physical examination, and concluded there was no functional loss despite the Veteran's report of overhead lifting, and his statement was outweighed by the evidence. Therefore, it was not undebatable that a 20 percent rating was warranted under 38 C.F.R. 4.59 at that time for the right shoulder disability. The RO weighed the evidence in assigning a noncompensable rating and determined the Veteran did not have painful motion requiring the minimum compensable for the right shoulder given the lack of evidence of pain documented within the 2016 examination report, and in the absence of functional loss due to painful motion for a particular joint. The RO reasonably determined the Veteran was not entitled to a 10 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 or a 20 percent rating under DC 5201, as the Veteran's range of motion was normal and was not limited to shoulder level. As a result, the Board does not find that it is undebatable that the RO committed a clear and unmistakable error in applying the law, as it existed and was interpreted in March 2016, to the facts of the Veteran's case.

In addition, the M21-1 guidance as it existed at the time of the March 2016 rating decision and as revised effective May 23, 2016, discussed above, is evidence of a prior policy that has since been altered. Indeed, the current version of the M21-1 specifically states that "[Sowers] represents a change in longstanding VA policy in which the minimum compensable evaluation was interpreted as a 10-percent evaluation irrespective of the DC involved." Thus, the Board finds that Sowers put in motion a "change in interpretation" of a VA regulation, precluding a finding of CUE. The plain language of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 states that revision of a final decision on the basis of CUE is not warranted based on a change in interpretation of law or VA issue. "A determination that there was a CUE must be based on the record and the law that existed at the time of the prior . . . decision." Russell, 3 Vet. App. at 314. This standard requires that the argument must be based on the law as it was understood at the time of the decision.  

A judicial decision that formulates a new interpretation of the law subsequent to a final VA decision cannot be the basis of a valid CUE claim. George v. McDonough, 142 S. Ct. 1953, 1959-60 (2022); Berger v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 166, 170 (1997) (specifically holding that judicial opinions from the Court that formulate new interpretations of the law subsequent to an RO decision cannot be the basis of a valid CUE claim); Damrel, 6 Vet. App. at 246. Although a judicial decision must be given full retroactive effect in all cases that are still open on direct review, it does not affect decisions that are final. Smith v. West, 11 Vet. App. 134, 37-38 (1998); Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde, 514 U.S. 749, 758 (1995) ("new legal principles, even when applied retroactively, do not apply to cases already closed"). Nothing in the applicable statute or regulation allowing for revision of a final decision on the basis of CUE indicates that a prior final and binding decision may be reversed or amended simply because a new judicial determination changed the way an existing law was interpreted.  38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.  

In conclusion, following Sowers v. McDonald, effective February 12, 2016, the DC most appropriate to the disability being evaluated, and § 4.59 must be applied accordingly. Effective May 23, 2016, the minimum compensable evaluation under § 4.59 refers to the lowest evaluation specified under the DC most applicable to the disability, and this change occurred after the March 2016 decision. At the time of the March 2016 rating decision, it was "longstanding VA policy [that the] minimum compensable evaluation [under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59] was interpreted as a 10 percent evaluation irrespective of the DC involved" based on actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury. See Petitti, 27 Vet. App. at 424-26 ("Under § 4.59, the trigger for a minimum disability rating is an 'actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joint[].'" (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.59)).

Functional loss due to pain is rated at the same level where functional loss is impeded. Stated another way, a range of motion may be possible beyond the point when pain sets in, but for rating the disability, only to the extent pain limits motion is considered. Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. At 43. As clinical examination revealed no pain on motion and the examination report and medical records supported a noncompensable rating, the RO did not commit CUE in weighing the evidence in support of the conclusion that the Veteran did not experience pain on range of motion and thus was not entitled to a compensable rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59; see also Mitchell, 25 Vet. at 33, 43. 

The assignment of a noncompensable rating for the Veteran's right shoulder disability involved a weighing of facts. An exercise of judgment that cannot now be said to constitute the kind of CUE defined by Fugo, as such weighing of facts cannot rise to the level of CUE. Fugo, supra. To reiterate, the Board does not find that the evidence clearly and unmistakably established entitlement to 20 percent rating for the Veteran's right shoulder disability at the time of the March 2016 rating decision based on the law extant at that time and the facts, as the Veteran had full range of motion of the right shoulder joint. The assignment of the noncompensable rating was supportable based on the facts considered at that time.

In conclusion, the Veteran has not identified a CUE in the March 2016 rating decision that, but for the error, would have resulted in a manifest change in the outcome. Accordingly, the motion to revise the March 2016 rating decision on the grounds of CUE in the RO's assignment of a noncompensable rating for right shoulder disability is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
