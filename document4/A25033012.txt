REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2018 to August 2023.

The case is on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision.

In an April 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Service connection for foot pain.

2. Service connection for frostbite, organic residuals of (feet).

3. Service connection for migraine.

4. Service connection for shin splints.

5. Service connection for a spine condition.

6. Service connection for tinnitus.

The RO previously scheduled VA examinations for January 2024.  Notification appears to have gone to an incorrect mailing address, however.  The file includes an Appointment Notification from the scheduling facility.  It lists a mailing address for the Veteran different from the mailing address he gave in his June 2023 claim.  The address on his claim form appears to have been his current mailing address in January 2024.  The RO conducted an address verification in March 2024, which revealed a newer address.  The Veteran's April 2024 NOD, however, listed the mailing address he provided on his claim form.  Thus, this appears to have been his current mailing address at the time of the VA examinations.  

The file also includes a Veteran Contact History, which indicates the schedule examination facility notified the Veteran of the VA examination in December 2023 and January 2024 by text and telephone.  It is not clear if the Veteran received such notifications.  

At this stage, without advanced written notice, the Board finds that remand is needed to attempt to reschedule the VA examinations.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for the foot pain; frostbite, organic residuals of (feet); migraine; shin splints; spine condition; and tinnitus, to determine if the Veteran has a current disability at least as likely as not related to service.  Advanced notice of the VA examination(s) must be mailed to the Veteran at his current mailing address of record.
