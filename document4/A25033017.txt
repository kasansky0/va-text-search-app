REMANDED

Entitlement to basic eligibility for VA educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 3320, known as the Edith Nourse Rogers Science Technology Engineering Math (STEM) Scholarship, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2013 to July 2018.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to basic eligibility for VA educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 3320, known as the STEM Scholarship, is remanded.

The Veteran claims entitlement to the STEM Scholarship for a graduate physician's assistant program. 

In the March 2022 decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim, but the Board finds that the evidence of record is insufficient for the Board adjudicate the claim.

The Board finds remand is warranted to satisfy a statutory duty under 38 U.S.C. § 5104. 38 C.F.R. §20.802(a) (the Board may remand for correction of any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim).

Generally, notice under 38 U.S.C. § 5104 must include the following:

1. Identification of the issues adjudicated.

2. A summary of the evidence considered by the Secretary.

3. A summary of the applicable laws and regulations.

4. Identification of findings favorable to the claimant.

5. In the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial.

6. An explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision.

7. If applicable, identification of the criteria that must be satisfied to grant service connection or the next higher level of compensation.

38 U.S.C. § 5104 (b).

The decision on appeal does not comply with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 5104 (b), and there is insufficient additional documentation to determine how the AOJ decided that the Veteran's program of study was not eligible for the STEM scholarship. 

Without adequate notice of the basis for the denial, claimants cannot make an informed decision as to whether or not to accept or appeal the decision nor can they know what evidence to submit in order to substantiate the appeal. See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 252 (2007) (discussing the legislative history of 38 U.S.C. § 5104 and the importance of clear and informative notice of decisions). Moreover, the Board cannot meaningfully review the AOJ's determination, especially in light of the fact that the initial decision was not made available for review by the Board. On remand, the AOJ must associate with the record copies of all documents relied upon to support the conclusion that the Veteran is not eligible for the STEM scholarship. 

In addition, the AOJ must provide complete notice of the decisions on appeal as required by 38 U.S.C. § 5104, to include citation to any internal guidance or other authority relied upon to support the conclusion that the Veteran is not eligible for the STEM scholarship
