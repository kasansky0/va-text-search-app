ISSUE

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for residuals jaw augmentation to include teeth problems as due to a severe class II bite with malocclusion (jaw disability).

ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for the jaw disability is DENIED.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's jaw disability is characterized by masticatory surfaces that cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis; but not by all upper and lower teeth on one side missing, all lower anterior teeth missing, nor all upper anterior teeth missing.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial compensable disability rating for the jaw disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Code 9913.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States from March 1983 to March 1987. On May 9, 2022, the Veteran filed a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). On June 28, 2024, the VA Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision pertinent to the issue on appeal. On August 1, 2024, the Veteran noted a timely appeal of the rating decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board). The appeal is prosecuted pursuant to the modernized review system.    

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board has reviewed the evidence in the Veteran's claims file.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this Decision, there is no requirement that every piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on her behalf be discussed in detail. Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-130 (2000).

I.

Increased Ratings Claims - General Legal Criteria

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations.  38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.321(a), 4.1. 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38?C.F.R. §?4.7. 

It is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified; findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom are sufficient; and above all, a coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38?C.F.R. §?4.21. 

In accordance with sections 4.1 and 4.2 of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations and Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589 (1991), the Board has reviewed all evidence of record pertaining to the history of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. The Board has found nothing in the historical record which would lead to the conclusion that the current evidence of record is not adequate for rating purposes. 

When it is not possible to separate the effects of a non-service-connected condition from those of a service-connected disorder, reasonable doubt should be resolved in the claimant's favor with regard to the question of whether certain signs and symptoms can be attributed to the service-connected disability. Mittleider v. West, 11?Vet. App.?181, 182 (1998); see also 38?C.F.R. §?3.102. 

Additionally, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §?4.3. 

Where the criteria for a compensable rating are not met, a noncompensable rating will be assigned.?38 C.F.R. § 4.31. 

Separate disability ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not "duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology" of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown,?6 Vet. App. 259, 262?(1994).? 

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). 

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). That said, higher evaluations may be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). This practice is known as staged ratings. Id. 

The Board is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Jaw Disability - Legal Criteria and Analysis

The Veteran is seeking an initial compensable disability rating for her jaw disability.

The Board notes that VA has amended the rating criteria for dental and oral conditions effective from September 10, 2017. These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after September 10, 2017. Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied. The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

The Veteran's disability is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Diagnostic Code 9913, for loss of teeth due to loss of substance of body of maxilla or mandible without loss of continuity. Diagnostic Code 9913 was not changed by the September 10, 2017 amendments.

Under Diagnostic Code 9913, for loss of teeth due to loss of substance of body of maxilla or mandible without loss of continuity, a noncompensable rating is warranted where the loss of masticatory surface can be restored with suitable prosthesis.

A 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 9913 is warranted for all upper and lower teeth on one side are missing where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for all lower anterior teeth are missing where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for all upper anterior teeth are missing where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis.

A 20 percent rating is warranted for all upper and lower anterior teeth are missing where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis. A 20 percent rating is also warranted for all upper and lower posterior teeth are missing where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis.

A 30 percent rating is warranted for loss of all lower teeth where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis. A 30 percent rating is also warranted for loss of all upper teeth where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis.

A 40 percent rating is warranted for loss of all teeth where the lost masticatory surface cannot be restored by suitable prosthesis.

A Note to Diagnostic Code 9913 provides that these ratings apply only to bone loss through trauma or disease such as osteomyelitis, and not to the loss of the alveolar process as a result of periodontal disease, since such loss is not considered disabling.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2024 in which the examiner noted that the masticatory surfaces could not be restored by suitable prosthesis. The Veteran's missing teeth were noted on the right upper as numbers: 1; left upper: 15 and 16; left lower: 17; and right lower: 32.

Based on the foregoing, a higher rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 9913. The Board recognizes that the Veteran has had missing teeth; however, the criteria for a higher rating; namely, all upper and lower teeth on one side missing, all lower anterior teeth missing, or all upper anterior teeth missing, is not shown.

All potentially applicable diagnostic codes have been considered, and there is no basis to assign an alternative evaluation. See Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 593. In addition to the medical evidence above, the Board has considered the lay evidence in the form of the Veteran's statements.  A layperson is competent to testify regarding the onset and continuity of symptomatology. Heuer v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 379 (1995); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398 (1995); Caldwell v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 466 (1991). However, affording the Veteran full competence and credibility, her statements do not show impairment more closely approximating the criteria for a higher rating. 

As the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. For these reasons, the claim is denied.
