ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 23, 2018 for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On August 23, 2018, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) received notice of intent to file a claim.

2. On November 5, 2018, the AOJ received a VA Form 21-8940 (Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability); the Veteran indicated that his claim for TDIU was based on his service-connected ischemic heart disease and his nonservice-connected lumbar spine disorder.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to August 23, 2018 for an award of entitlement to TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1969 to December 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision in this case was issued after February 19, 2019; thus, the AMA framework applies.

In a February 29, 2020 rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, awarded the Veteran TDIU, effective August 23, 2018.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on March 6, 2020. 

The Veteran, on October 16, 2020, filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, requesting review of the February 2020 rating decision as to the effective date assigned for the award of TDIU.

In an April 11, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ reviewed the evidence of record at the time of the prior rating decision and denied the Veteran's request for an earlier effective date for the award of TDIU.  The Veteran was notified of the rating decision on April 17, 2024.

The Veteran appealed the April 2024 rating decision to the Board by filing a May 7, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.  The Veteran requested Direct Review.  On May 20, 2024, the Board acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182).  Accordingly, under its review, the Board will now only consider all evidence of record at the time of the April 17, 2024 notice of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Duties to Notify and Assist

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Earlier Effective Date

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increased, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  

In assigning effective dates for increases, except as provided in paragraph § 3.400(o)(2) and § 3.401(b), the effective date is date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  As an exception to this general rule, § 3.400(o)(2) provides that the effective date is the earliest date of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of claim.  

The Court has held that 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) are applicable only where an increase in disability precedes a claim for an increased disability rating.  See Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997).  Thus, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of the case: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable); or (3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim).  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, supra. 

The Court has made it clear that the date of the filing of a claim is controlling in determinations as to effective dates.  A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  

Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by VA.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by VA, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Under the modernized, AMA, system of review, an effective date can be preserved if a claim is continuously pursued.  For a claim to be continuously pursued, a supplemental claim must be filed within one year after a final decision or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  For continuously pursued claims, except as otherwise provided by other provisions of this part, including 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision, provided that any appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must be accepted as timely by that court.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  

Except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision or the Board issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

In a recent decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) invalidated the part of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework; thus, if a supplemental claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the date the intent to file was received is the date of claim for effective date purposes. Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A pending claim is an application, formal or informal, which has not been finally adjudicated. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(c).  The pending claims doctrine provides that a claim remains pending in the adjudication process if VA fails to act on it.  Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 422 (1999).  Raising a pending claim theory in connection with a challenge to the effective-date decision is procedurally proper.  Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 249, 255 (2007).

Regarding the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statue or regulation.  However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. This is determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober; 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the facts found.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011). For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 23, 2018 for the award of TDIU.

The Veteran is in receipt of a TDIU effective August 23, 2018.  He and his representative challenge the effective date.   In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran's representative submitted a May 2024 statement regarding the effective date assigned to his award of TDIU, wherein the Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran should be entitled to an effective date of December 19, 2016 for the award of TDIU or, in the alternative, be awarded an additional period of temporary TDIU effective July 15, 2013.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's representative, in the aforementioned May 2024 statement, asserts that the Veteran is entitled to TDIU effective December 19, 2016, based on the date that the Veteran last worked full-time, or in the alternative, be awarded temporary TDIU effective July 15, 2013.  In support of this assertion, the Veteran's representative alleges that the Veteran's statements in support of his July 15, 2013 claim for service connection for ischemic heart disease should have been construed as including a claim for TDIU.  The Veteran's representative asserts that, in accordance with Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001), a claim for TDIU was reasonably raised by the record in connection with the Veteran's July 15, 2013 claim for service connection for ischemic heart disease.  The Veteran's representative acknowledges that the Veteran last worked in December 2016, and that entitlement did not arise before December 2016, but that the Veteran's date of claim should be July 15, 2013 is warranted because, in his November 2018 claim for TDIU, the Veteran relied in part on his service-connected ischemic heart disease.  In short, the Veteran's representative states that the "date of the claim for TDIU is not the day the VA first received his application/intent to file for [TDIU] (i.e., August 23, 2018) but rather the date VA received the underlying claim (i.e., July 15, 2013)" and thus, "the proper effective date is the date entitlement arose, that is, when the veteran stopped working due to his physical disabilities," December 19, 2016. The Veteran's representative also argues that "[t]o the extent that the veteran was precluded from working in 2013, however, the Board should consider whether a period of temporary TDIU applies" in accordance with VAOPGCPREC 5-2005.

The Board acknowledges that VA is required to consider whether entitlement to TDIU is warranted when a Veteran seeks an increased disability rating and submits evidence of unemployability, even if the Veteran does not specifically state that he is seeking TDIU benefits.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453 (2009) (holding that a request for TDIU can be reasonably raised by the record).  The Board also acknowledges that, when a claim is filed or is reasonably raised, it will remain pending until there is an explicit adjudication or until the claimant could reasonably recognize in a subsequent agency decision that the claim was fully adjudicated.  Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 243 (2007).  The implicit denial doctrine, on the other hand, indicates that, under certain circumstances "a claim for benefits will be deemed to have been denied, and thus finally adjudicated, even if [the AOJ or the Board] did not expressly address that claim in its decision."  Cogburn v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 205 (2010), aff'd, Cogburn v. McDonald, 809 F.3d 1232 (2016).  

In Locklear v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 311, 315 (2011), the Court addressed the implicit denial doctrine as it relates to a TDIU claim.  The Court noted that a request for a TDIU is not a separate claim for benefits, but instead a request for an appropriate disability rating as part of the initial adjudication of a claim or a claim for increased compensation.  Id. (quoting Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009)).  The Court observed that an "award of a disability rating less than 100 [percent]" in a rating decision "generally provides notice as to how the Secretary has rated a claimant's condition and serves as a final decision, if unappealed, with regard to entitlement to any higher disability rating associated with the underlying disability, including TDIU."  Id. at 316 (citing Ingram, 21 Vet. App. at 248).

As to the Veteran's allegation, through his representative, that TDIU was reasonably raised by the record in July 2013, the Board finds that TDIU was implicitly denied in the March 2014 rating decision, which awarded the Veteran service connection for ischemic heart disease and assigned a 30 percent disability evaluation.  To this point, the Board notes that the March 2014 rating decision expressly found that the Veteran was not entitled to a higher, 60 percent disability evaluation.  The Board acknowledges that the March 2014 rating decision did not specifically recite the laws and regulations pertinent to a claim for TDIU, and that TDIU was not explicitly discussed in either the narrative portion of the rating decision or the notice letter.  However, in assigning the Veteran a 30 percent disability evaluation for his ischemic heart disease, and expressly denying a higher, 60 percent disability rating for his ischemic heart disease in the rating narrative and notice letter, the AOJ also effectively denied entitlement to a higher, 100 percent rating, to include based on entitlement to a TDIU.  See, e.g., Locklear, 24 Vet. App. at 315.  The Veteran did not file an appeal of this decision challenging either the rating or the absence of an award of TDIU.

Likewise, to the extent that the Veteran argues that the Veteran should have been entitled to a temporary TDIU pursuant to VAOPGCPREC 5-2005, because the Veteran reported at the February 2014 VA examination that he could not work for nine months following his May 2013 heart attack, the Board finds that this argument is without merit.  In this regard, the Board acknowledges that VA General Counsel has concluded that 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 permits the award of a TDIU based on temporary (i.e., non-permanent) inability to follow a substantially gainful occupation. VAOPGCPREC 5-2005 (Nov. 25, 2005).  However, VA General Counsel also concluded that an inability to work for temporary periods does not necessarily establish an inability to follow a substantially gainful occupation for purposes of VA regulations, because brief periods of incapacity that would require time off from work would not necessarily preclude a Veteran from obtaining or holding employment and earning a reasonable income from such employment.  As previously discussed, the Veteran's impairment due to his ischemic heart disease was not considered severe enough to warrant a schedular rating in excess of 30 percent.  Loss of industrial capacity is the principal factor in assigning schedular disability ratings.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.  Indeed, 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 specifically states: "[g]enerally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability."  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran was not entitled to a temporary TDIU in July 2013.  Rather, the Veteran should have pursued a claim for a temporary total rating for convalescence under 38 C.F.R. §  4.30, which he did not.  

As noted above, for increased rating claims, which TDIU is considered to be, the effective date for TDIU is either the date entitlement arose or the date of receipt of claim, whichever is later.  

Turning to the date of claim, the VA first received a communication from the Veteran evincing intent to apply for benefits on August 23, 2018.  VA received a completed VA Form 21-8940 (Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability) on November 5, 2018, wherein the Veteran claimed entitlement to TDIU due to his service-connected ischemic heart disease and his nonservice-connected back disorder.  There is no application for TDIU prior to this date, and there is no increased rating claim prior to this date upon which a claim for TDIU could be attached; the Veteran did not disagree with the initial rating assigned for his ischemic heart disease following the March 2014 grant of service connection, nor did he file a claim for an increased disability evaluation in the years between the March 2014 rating decision and the November 5, 2018 claim for TDIU.  Moreover, the Veteran did not make any assertions of entitlement to TDIU in connection with other claims for benefits.  Thus, the proper date of claim for the Veteran's TDIU is August 23, 2018. 

With regard to when entitlement arose, if entitlement arose within the year prior to the date of claim, then the effective date can be the date within that year that entitlement arose.  However, if it arose more than a year prior to or after the date of claim, then the date of claim is the proper effective date.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Turning to the question of when entitlement to TDIU arose, TDIU may be granted only when it is established that the service-connected disabilities are so severe, standing alone, as to prevent the retaining or obtaining of substantially gainful employment.  If there is only one service-connected disability, it must be ratable at 60 percent or more to qualify for benefits based on individual unemployability.  If there are two or more such disabilities, there must be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  For purposes of this section, disabilities of both upper or lower extremities will be considered a single disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a)(1).

The criteria also include a subjective standard.  Unemployability is synonymous with inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. VAOPGCPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2,317 (1992). "Substantially gainful employment" is that employment "which is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides."  Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991).  "Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment."  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In evaluating the Veteran's unemployability, the law states that in order to establish entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities, there must be impairment so severe that it is impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). Consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or to the impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19 (2015); Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

As noted above, entitlement to a benefit arises when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought.  Here, as previously discussed, the Veteran was in receipt of a 30 percent disability rating for his service-connected ischemic heart disease, effective July 15, 2013.  In addition, the Veteran was in receipt of service connection for prostate cancer, status-post radical prostatectomy with residual voiding urgency, rated as 20 percent disabling from December 1, 2012, 60 percent disabling from May 10, 2014, and 20 percent disabling from September 1, 2019.  The Veteran is also in receipt of a 50 percent disability evaluation for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, effective August 15, 2019 and a 10 percent disability evaluation for tinnitus, effective December 21, 2016.  Noncompensable disability evaluations are assigned for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss (effective December 21, 2016), facial scar (effective December 21, 2016), erectile dysfunction (effective May 14, 2012), abdominal scars (effective May 14, 2012), and scar, status-post percutaneous coronary intervention (effective July 15, 2013).  The Veteran's combined disability evaluation was 70 percent effective May 10, 2014, 80 percent effective December 21, 2016, and 90 percent effective July 8, 2019.  As such, the Veteran met the schedular criteria for TDIU effective May 10, 2014.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

Nevertheless, the evidence does not demonstrate, and the Veteran does not argue, that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable prior to December 29, 2016.  The Veteran and his representative have effectively conceded that the Veteran's service-connected ischemic heart disease did not impact the Veteran's ability to work until December 29, 2016.  See May 2024 representative's statement.  Moreover, the Veteran's November 2018 VA Form 21-8940 and a January 2019 VA Form 21-4192 (Request for Employment Information in Connection with Claim for Disability Benefits), completed by the Veteran's employer, show that the Veteran last worked on December 29, 2016.  However, the Board reiterates that the Veteran, in his November 2018 VA 21-8940 and in a January 2019 statement, also conceded that he was claiming TDIU in part based on his nonservice-connected back disorder.  As such, the Board finds that entitlement to TDIU arose on December 29, 2016. Consequently, if the date of claim is August 23, 2018, then the effective date should be the later of the two dates, and an effective date prior to August 23, 2018 is not warranted.

To the extent that the Veteran argues that the Veteran is entitled to TDIU one year prior to the Veteran's August 23, 2018 claim because he has been service-connected for ischemic heart disease since July 2013 and stopped working in December 2016, this is more than one year prior to the August 23, 2018 date of claim, thus, entitlement to an effective date prior to the date of claim, August 23, 2018, would not be warranted because entitlement to TDIU did not arise within the one year prior to the date of claim.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (for an award of an effective date one year prior to the date of an increased rating claim, the claim must have been filed within one year of when the increase was factually ascertainable; if the claim was filed more than one year after that date, the provision for the one-year earlier date does not apply).  Also, if entitlement arose after August 23, 2018, then the date of claim assigned as the effective date is the earliest date possible because the date entitlement arose would be after the date of claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 23 2018 for the award of TDIU is denied.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.16.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
