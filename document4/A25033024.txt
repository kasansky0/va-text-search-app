FINDING OF FACT

In October 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received written notification from the Veteran through her attorney that it was her intent to withdraw her appeal seeking higher initial ratings for service-connected abscessed episiotomy site, bladder issues, vaginal conditions, and tachycardia, all effective July 14, 2014.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Regarding the claims seeking higher initial ratings for service-connected abscessed episiotomy site, bladder issues, vaginal conditions, and tachycardia, all effective July 14, 2014, the criteria for withdrawal of an April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty in the Air Force from April 1984 to February 1985 and from August 1986 to May 1990.  This case comes to the Board on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which implemented a January 2023 Board decision, which granted service connection for abscessed episiotomy site, bladder issues, vaginal conditions, and tachycardia, and which assigned noncompensable ratings pending new VA examinations to thoroughly evaluate the level of disability for each condition.  A March 2023 RO rating decision assigned higher initial ratings for each disability, effective July 14, 2014.  On her March 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

In the present case, after the Board received the Veteran's appeal but prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran through her attorney submitted a written statement in October 2024, requesting that her appeal seeking higher initial ratings for service-connected abscessed episiotomy site, bladder issues, vaginal conditions, and tachycardia, all effective July 14, 2014, be withdrawn.  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration on the claims.  Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.
