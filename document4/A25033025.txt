DOCKET NO. 211008-189852
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for low back spondylolisthesis and degenerative arthritis (low back disability) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's low back disability had its onset in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a low back disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 2001 to July 2005 and from July 2006 to May 2007, including service in the Persian Gulf.   

In the October 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran and his spouse presented sworn testimony at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in April 2025.  At the proceeding the Veteran waived the 90-day period following the appeal during which to submit additional evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 20.3000(b).  As such, the Board will proceed to adjudicate this appeal.

Service connection for a low back disability.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a low back disability, which he contends began in service and has been recurrent since that time. 

During the April 2025 hearing, the Veteran testified that he had many duties while in service, including crawling through the aircraft with tanks, checking for sand, and a lot of heavy lifting.  He stated that he first started having back pain while serving in Kuwait.  He reported that the pain would come and go and continued after service.  The Veteran testified that he went to a chiropractor after service.  The Veteran's spouse testified that she met the Veteran in July 2007 and stated that the Veteran has had back problems since that time.  

Medical treatment records show that the Veteran has a diagnosis of low back spondylolisthesis and degenerative arthritis.  See VA Examination, August 2021. 

During the August 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he developed low back pain while wearing SCBA - self-contained breathing apparatus- while in service.  He reported that his back pain was made worse by crawling through scuttles.  The Veteran stated that he reported low back pain to the doctor two times, but no treatment was provided.  He did not seek further treatment until 2020, because he was told "don't be a whiner" by a doctor.  The Veteran reported that he did go to a chiropractor on his own in 2007 after he got home from service and would go four to five times per year.  He stated that he would wait to see the chiropractor until his pain was unbearable.

The Board finds that the Veteran is competent to report symptom onset and challenges he experiences as a result of his low back disability.  The Veteran's statements are entitled to probative weight, as they are internally consistent and consistent with other evidence of record, to include his wife's testimony, showing that the Veteran reported low back pain in and since service.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  In its role as a finder of fact, the Board finds the Veteran's account of having a low back disability during and since service credible.

The Board acknowledges the negative nexus VA opinion regarding the etiology of the Veteran's low back disability.  However, the Board finds that this opinion carries no probative weight as it appear to have impermissibly ignored the Veteran's competent, credible reports of low back symptoms beginning in service.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249 (2020).

As the competent and credible lay and medical evidence shows that the Veteran's low back disability had its onset in service, service connection is warranted.  See Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces).
