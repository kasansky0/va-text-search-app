DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of May 27, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of 100 percent rating for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder is GRANTED.

Entitlement to an effective date of May 27, 2022, but no earlier, for basic eligibility to Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA) based on permanent and total disability status is GRANTED.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities from May 3, 2022 to May 26, 2022 is GRANTED. 

Entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities from May 27, 2022 is DISMISSED.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a June 2009 rating decision, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) granted service connection for PTSD; the Veteran did not initiate an appeal within the requisite time period nor was relevant evidence received and the decision is final.

2. In an August 2022 rating decision, the RO increased the rating for PTSD from 50 to 70 percent.

3. In an October 2022 rating decision, the RO denied entitlement to a TDIU.

4. On April 11, 2023, the Veteran submitted an intent to file with a completed VA 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, and VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application on November 22, 2023; the Veteran has continuously pursued increased rating PTSD and TDIU claims.

5. The date entitlement arose for a 100 percent (total) disability rating for service-connected PTSD was May 27, 2022.

6. From May 3, 2022 to May 26, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to perform substantial gainful employment.

7. From May 27, 2022, the Veteran had a total schedular rating. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of May 27, 2022 for the grant of a 100 percent rating for PTSD with major depressive disorder have been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date of May 27, 2022 for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status have been met.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

3. From May 3, 2022 to May 26, 2022, the criteria for entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities have been met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

4. From May 27, 2022, the claim for entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities is moot and the claim is dismissed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.101.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1969 to February 1972.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision of the RO.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

I

Legal Criteria - Effective Date

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

However, there are exceptions to this rule. Where compensation is awarded pursuant to any Act or administrative issue, the effective date of such award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the Act or administrative issue, and in no event shall the award be retroactive for more than one year from the date of application therefor or the date of the administrative determination of entitlement, whichever is earlier. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).

If the award of compensation is due to a liberalizing change in the law or an administrative issue, the effective date of the award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts but shall not be earlier than the date of the change in the law. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(p), 3.114(a). Under the effective date rules for liberalizing laws, where a claim is reviewed on the initiative of VA more than one year after the effective date of the law or VA issue, benefits may be authorized for a period of one year prior to the date of administrative determination of entitlement. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(2), (3).

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim was "a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). An informal claim is "[a]ny communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits." 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). VA must look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as applications or claims - formal and informal - for benefits and is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits. Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992). 

The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are: (1) an intent to apply for benefits; (2) an identification of the benefits sought; and (3) a communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the plain language of the regulations requires a claimant to have intent to file a claim for VA benefits).

For claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57660, 57686 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015). Claims or appeals pending before VA on that date are to be decided based on the regulations as they existed prior to the amendment. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57660, 57686.

Moreover, under the rules of the modernized review system (AMA), an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). For decisions rendered after a Higher-Level Review by the RO, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182. Id. 

The term "continuous pursuit" only applies to AMA decisions. Specifically, when a claim filed under AMA is granted in an initial decision, the effective date of an AMA initial decision will be the later of the date of the supplemental claim, or the date of entitlement. Thus, even if a supplemental claim is received within one year of a legacy decision, the date of receipt of the supplemental claim will be considered the date of claim for effective date purposes. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(h), 3.2500(f).

Upon receipt of an incomplete supplemental claim, VA shall notify the claimant and his or her representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form prescribed by VA. If VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date VA received the incomplete application. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i).

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term date entitlement arose is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a facts found basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the RO receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

In general, decisions of the RO and the Board that are not appealed in the prescribed time period are final. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.1100, 20.1103. Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105. CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error." It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. See Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).

Procedural History

In a March 2008 VA 21-526 Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension, the Veteran requested service connection for PTSD.  In a June 2009 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for PTSD, rated 50 percent disabling, effective March 5, 2008.  The Veteran was notified of the award in a June 2009 notification letter that included procedural and appeal rights. 

Because the Veteran did not initiate an appeal of the June 2009 rating decision within one year, it became final.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d).  The only way that a final rating decision can be revised is if it contains clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006); 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).

Further, it does not appear any additional relevant evidence was physically or constructively associated with the claims folder within one year of the June 2009 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. §3.156(b); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011); see also Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 251-52 (2010).

On May 3, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) requesting an increased rating for PTSD.  In an August 2022 rating decision, the RO increased the rating for PTSD from 50 percent to 70 percent, effective May 3, 2022.  The same month, the Veteran was notified of the award and procedural and appeal rights.  

Additionally, in August 2022, the RO sent a development letter to the Veteran requesting completion of a VA Form 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  In an October 2022 rating decision, the RO denied entitlement to a TDIU.

On April 11, 2023, the Veteran submitted an intent to file. On November 22, 2023, he submitted a completed VA 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, and VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application requesting entitlement to a TDIU.

Because the supplemental claim was received within one year of the intent to file, the date of the intent to file was received is the date of the claim for effective date purposes.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 excluding supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework is invalid for contravening the unambiguous meaning of their governing statutory provisions).

Therefore, the November 2023 TDIU application and supplemental claim stating that TDIU was part and parcel of the PTSD increased rating claim, were received by VA on April 11, 2023, the date of the intent to file.  As these relevant documents were received within one year of August 2022 and October 2022 AMA rating decisions, the Veteran has continuously pursued the claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

In an April 2024 rating decision, the RO increased the rating for PTSD from 70 percent to 100 percent, effective April 11, 2023, and granted eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status established from April 11, 2023.  The RO found entitlement to a TDIU now moot, effective April 11, 2023.  The Veteran timely submitted a May 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, giving rise to the present appeal before the Board.

Analysis - PTSD

The Veteran requests an earlier effective date for the 100 percent rating assigned for PTSD based on continuous pursuit of the appeal. Currently, the Veteran has been awarded a 100 percent rating for PTSD, effective April 11, 2023, the date of the intent to file a claim.

The Board is bound by the law and regulations governing the date of the Veteran's claim.  The relevant regulation provides that an effective date for an award for compensation is the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.    

As detailed in the procedural history section, the Veteran has continuously pursued the increased rating claim adjudicated in an August 2022 AMA rating decision.  This appeal initially arose from receipt of an application for compensation on May 3, 2022 - this is the date of receipt of the claim.

The RO award of 100 percent for service-connected PTSD is based on May 27, 2022 and April 20, 2024 VA PTSD Examination findings.  Construing the evidence in the most favorable light to the Veteran, the earliest date that entitlement arose was on May 27, 2022.

The effective date is based on the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Here, the proper effective date is May 27, 2022, the date entitlement arose because this is a later date than May 3, 2022 date of application. 

Based on the foregoing, an effective date of May 27, 2022, but no earlier, for the 100 percent rating for PTSD is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

Analysis - DEA 

The Veteran requests an earlier effective date for DEA eligibility because the matter is part and parcel of the PTSD increased rating and TDIU claims.  He has been awarded eligibility for DEA based on permanent and total disability status established from April 11, 2023.

With regard to the effective date assigned to eligibility for DEA benefits, the Board notes that basic eligibility for DEA benefits exists if the veteran: 1) was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service and 2) has a permanent total service-connected disability; or had a permanent total service connected disability at the date of death; or died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3501.

Here, the date of application is May 3, 2022, based on the continuously pursued AMA claim. Pursuant to this decision, the Veteran is now rated 100 percent (total) for service-connected PTSD from May 27, 2022. This is the date entitlement arose and the date that the Veteran met the criteria for DEA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 3501.

Therefore, an effective date of May 27, 2022, for the award of DEA benefits is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 3501.

II

Legal Criteria - TDIU

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3)disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table).

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Id. 

Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id. 

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The Court has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled. Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994) (citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990)). Thus, if VA has found a Veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate that Veteran totally disabled on any other basis. See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

A grant of 100 percent disability does not always render the issue of TDIU moot. VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his or her disabilities establish entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).

Analysis - TDIU

The Veteran asserts that entitlement to a TDIU is not moot, as he may be entitled to benefits prior to April 11, 2023.

As the Veteran has demonstrated continuous pursuit of the PTSD increased rating AMA appeal, which TDIU is part and parcel of, the relevant review period for entitlement to a TDIU commenced on May 3, 2022, the date of application seeking an increased rating for PTSD.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009).

Pursuant to this Decision, the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating for service-connected disability PTSD, effective May 27, 2022.  As of this date, he has also been awarded DEA benefits based on permanent and total disability status.  

Therefore, from May 27, 2022, entitlement to a TDIU is moot because the schedular rating is total. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  Accordingly, as there remains no case or controversy concerning whether the appellant is entitled to the benefit sought, from May 27, 2022, the appeal of the claim for entitlement to a TDIU is moot and must be dismissed. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.101

Turning to the remaining appeal period. From May 3, 2022, the date of application to May 26, 2022, the Veteran was in receipt of a 70 percent rating for PTSD, 10 percent rating for bilateral tinnitus, and noncompensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss.  Because he had a single condition rated at 60 percent or higher, the Board may consider the claim for a TDIU on a schedular basis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Veteran worked as a police officer for 26 years until he retired in 2005 following a spinal cord injury. See June 2021 VA Treatment works.  VA treatment record document a spinal cord injury in 1988 due to a ladder fall treated with subsequent surgical procedures and ongoing treatment through 2021. The Veteran has not been granted service connection for a spine disability.  Therefore, any associated functional impairments from any spine disability are not relevant to the Board's analysis here because it is a nonservice-connected disability.

Turning to the impact of service-connected disabilities, the Veteran's tinnitus does not impact his ordinary conditions of daily life, including ability to work.  See May 2022 VA Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Examination.  As for hearing loss, he reported difficulty hearing people and asking them to repeat themselves but no impact on work activities.  Id.  The Veteran is not in receipt of a compensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss.  Therefore, this analysis will primarily focus on the impact of service-connected PTSD on the Veteran's ability to work. 

In the May 2022 application for compensation, the Veteran reported that his PTSD disability had worsened.  On May 2022 VA PTSD examination, the examiner found occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.  The Veteran reported that he stopped attending church, participating in woodworking and painting activities due to lack of interest and motivation.  He visits one friend once per month and has occasional visits with his spouse's family members.  He reported the inability to physically accomplish activities he was previously able to perform and described feelings of useless and worthless, including passive suicidal ideation. Under PTSD diagnostic criteria, the examiner found that PTSD symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 

Based on the Veteran's employment history and functional limitations described herein, the evidence is at least approximately balanced on whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevent substantial gainful employment, therefore the Board has resolved reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor in finding that during the remaining relevant appeal period from May 3, 2022 to May 26, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable.  

In this regard, a May 2022 examiner opined that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD symptoms alone cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. The Veteran reported lack of interest in social and work activities accompanied with feelings of useless and worthless accompanied with passive suicidal ideation. The examiner concluded that PTSD symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 

As reasonable doubt has been resolved in the Veteran's favor, entitlement to a schedular TDIU from May 3, 2022 to May 26, 2022, the remaining appeal period, is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

With respect to SMC consideration, the Veteran has a separate Board appeal for entitlement to SMC aid and attendance and housebound status benefits.  See March 2024 Rating Decision and April 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  The SMC matter will be addressed in a separate decision.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
