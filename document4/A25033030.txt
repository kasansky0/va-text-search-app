DOCKET NO. 210325-148806
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The issue of entitlement to service connection for headaches is dismissed.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is dismissed.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for coccyx injury is dismissed.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for chronic ingrown toenails is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On February 27, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision, the Veteran submitted a written statement indicating that she wished to withdraw from appellate consideration the issues of entitlement to service connection for headaches, obstructive sleep apnea, coccyx injury, and chronic ingrown toenails.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the issues of entitlement to service connection for headaches, obstructive sleep apnea, coccyx injury, and chronic ingrown toenails are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205; Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1994 to April 1998.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2020 rating decision that denied service connection for headaches, obstructive sleep apnea, coccyx injury, and chronic ingrown toenails. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by a veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  Id. 

In the present case, in correspondence dated in February 2025, the Veteran stated that he wished to withdraw from appellate consideration some, but not all, the issues listed on his March 2021 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, to include the issues of entitlement to service connection for headaches, obstructive sleep apnea, coccyx injury, and chronic ingrown toenails, under the above docket number.

To validly withdraw an appeal via a written communication, 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 states that the communication must include the name of the appellant, the applicable VA claims file number, and an indication that the appeal is withdrawn.  Further, the communication must identify the specific issues to be withdrawn or specify that the appeal in its entirety is withdrawn.  Id.; see also Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 2 (2020).

Here, the Board finds that the February 2025 correspondence by the Veteran satisfies the requirements pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 for a valid withdrawal of the issues of entitlement to service connection for headaches, obstructive sleep apnea, coccyx injury, and chronic ingrown toenails.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran has withdrawn the issues currently on appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the issues on appeal and they are dismissed.  Id.

The Board notes that the remaining issues under the above docket number are in abeyance following a March 10, 2025 Board hearing on those issues.  As the remaining issues in the above docket are still within the 90-day evidentiary window following the March 10, 2025 Board hearing, they will be distributed for adjudication once that period elapses.
