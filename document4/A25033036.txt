ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating of 100 percent rating for a heart disorder, to include sessile arial mass, is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran's heart disorder has resulted in a workload of 3 METs or less which results in the heart failure symptom of dyspnea, throughout the duration on appeal. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial 100 percent rating, but no higher, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.100, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1988 to March 1998. 

In April 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) issued a decision granting entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder. 

In May 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), implemented the Board decision, granting entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder, from February 8, 2017, at a 10 percent disability rating, under 38 C.F.R. 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by application of the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; see generally 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. Otherwise, the lower rating applies. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability determinations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Where, as here, the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). When the factual findings show distinct time periods during which the Veteran exhibited symptoms of disability and such symptoms warrant different disability ratings, staged ratings may be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

Entitlement to an initial rating of 60 percent for a heart disorder. 

The Veteran's heart disorder, to include sessile arial mass, is currently rated 10 percent disabling from February 8, 2017, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005. The Veteran generally seeks an increased rating for her heart disorder; specifically, the Veteran, through her representative, argues that she is entitled to a 100 percent rating from February 8, 2017, due to meeting the 100 percent rating criteria, which is exhibited in a 2018 VA examination. See May 2024 VA Form 10182. 

When evaluating disabilities of the cardiovascular system under Diagnostic Codes 7000-7007, 7011, and 7015-7020, it must be ascertained in all cases whether or not cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation (documented by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or x-ray) is present and whether or not there is a need for continuous medication. 38 C.F.R. § 4.100(a). METs testing is also required in all cases except: (1) when there is a medical contraindication; (2) when the left ventricular ejection fraction has been measured and is 50 percent or less; (3) when chronic congestive heart failure is present or there has been more than one episode of congestive heart failure within the past year; (4) when a 100 percent evaluation can be assigned on another basis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.100(b). If left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) testing is not of record, the cardiovascular disability must be based on the alternative criteria unless the examiner states that the LVEF test is needed in a particular case because the available medical information does not sufficiently reflect the severity of the cardiovascular disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.100(c).

For rating diseases of the heart, one MET (metabolic equivalent) is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. When the level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for rating, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope may be used. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2).

The Veteran is rated at a 10 percent disability rating due to continuous medication required for control of her heart disorder, from February 8, 2017, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005. 

Additionally, under Diagnostic Code 7005, a 30 percent rating is assigned when a workload greater than 5 METs but not greater than 7 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope; or there is evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation.

A 60 percent rating is assigned for more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year; or a workload of greater than 3 METs but not greater than 5 METs which results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope; or left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for chronic congestive heart failure; or a workload of 3 METs or less which results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope; or left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

Turning to the evidence, in May 2018, the Veteran underwent an in-person VA examination, where her records were reviewed, including her VA e-folder. After an interview-based METs test, the examiner estimated that the Veteran can perform a workload of greater than 1 METs but not greater than 3 METs resulting in dyspnea and an estimated LVEF of 55 to 60 percent. See May 2018 C&P Exam. 

In September 2021, the Veteran underwent an in-person VA examination, where her records were reviewed, including her VA e-folder. The VA examiner noted evidence of cardiac hypertrophy and LVEF of 55 percent confirmed by echocardiogram, from September 1, 2021. After an interview-based METs test, the examiner estimated that the Veteran can perform a workload of greater than 3 METs but not greater than 5 METs resulting in dyspnea. See September 2021 C&P Exam. 

In December 2021, the Veteran was afforded an additional in-person VA examination where her records, including her VA e-folder, were reviewed. The VA examiner found that normal sinus rhythm with non-specific T-wave abnormality and LVEF of 55 percent, were both exhibited by echocardiogram. Significantly, no METs testing was conducted, the examiner noted that, "this test is not without significant risk." See December 2021 C&P Exam. 

In the total medical evidence of record, there are only two valid METs tests record, in the May 2018 VA examination, which reports that the Veteran can perform a workload of greater than 1 METs but not greater than 3 METs resulting in dyspnea; and the September 2021 VA examination, which reports that the Veteran can perform a workload of greater than 3 METs but not greater than 5 METs resulting in dyspnea. The December 2021 VA examination reports that conducting a stress-test would pose "significant risk" to the Veteran. 

After careful consideration, the Board finds that, because from February 8, 2017, there are only two valid METs readings for consideration, the Board finds that any reasonable doubt remaining, is resolved in favor of the Veteran, and the METs reading more favorable, will be utilized for the time period on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Thus, the Board finds that the May 2018 VA examination reading, that found that the Veteran can perform a workload of greater than 1 METs but not greater than 3 METs resulting in dyspnea, is the appropriate one for consideration.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that an initial 100 percent rating is warranted for the period of the appeal. In this regard, a VA stress test performed in May 2018 revealed a workload of 1 to 3 METs with the Veteran reporting the symptom of dyspnea. A workload of greater than 1 MET but not greater than 3 METs which results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope warrants a 100 percent rating under C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005.

Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal is granted in full. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102; 4.3; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 780-81.
