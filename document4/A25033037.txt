ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 16, 2021, for the grant of service connection for hypertension is denied. 

Prior to December 7, 2023, entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for hypertension is denied. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to May 13, 2022, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. There is no evidence of a claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension prior to December 16, 2021.

2. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's hypertension was not manifested by diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more requiring continuous medication for control

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to December 16, 2021, for the award of service connection for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110 ; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

2. Prior to December 7, 2023, the criteria for an initial compensable rating for service-connected hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1978 to March 1979.  

This matter is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed the portion of the rating decision pertaining to the issue above and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  The Veteran had listed the September 2023 rating decision on his April 2024 Notice of Disagreement as the decision on appeal.  However, as there was a recent decision that addressed the issue of increased rating for hypertension in December 2023, the Board reviews the appeal in a liberal manner and find that the December 2023 should be the decision on appeal.  Id.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claim of increased rating for hypertension, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to a TDIU prior to May 13, 2022, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).   

1. Hypertension

Effective Date for the Grant of Service Connection for Hypertension

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for hypertension.  See April 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

For original claims for service connection, the effective date can be the day following separation from active service if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the rule is the date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).  

The Veteran submitted a December 16, 2021, claim for service connection for hypertension.  See December 2021 Fully Developed Claim.  The September 2023 rating decision granted service connection for hypertension and assigned a noncompensable rating effective December 16, 2021.  The effective date was the date of receipt of the initial claim for benefits.  Upon review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than December 16, 2021, for the award of service connection for hypertension is not warranted.  The Veteran has been granted service connection for hypertension effective December 16, 2021, the date of receipt of claim.  

The Veteran submitted claims for benefits prior to December 16, 2021, but there was no claim submitted for hypertension.  For instance, the Veteran submitted a February 2020 claim for service connection for depression.  He subsequently filed an application for veteran pension and listed the disabilities that prevented him from working as PTSD, depressive disorder, anti-social, and personality disorder.  Thus, the earliest effective date for the award of service connection for hypertension is December 16, 2021.

Based on the foregoing, entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 16, 2021, for the grant of service connection for hypertension is not warranted and the claim is denied.  

Disability Rating for Hypertension  

The Veteran continues to a seek a higher rating for his service-connected hypertension.  

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Different ratings may be assigned for different periods of time for the same disorder if the facts show distinct time periods with different levels of disability.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  According to DC 7101, a 10 percent disability evaluation is warranted where diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more, or the individual has a history of diastolic pressure of 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.  For the next higher 20 percent disability evaluation, diastolic pressure must be predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure must be 200 or more.  A 40 percent disability evaluation requires diastolic pressure to be predominantly 120 or more, and a 60 percent disability evaluation requires diastolic blood pressure to be predominantly 130 or more.  Id.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant. 

In rating hypertension under DC 7101, the Board may consider blood pressure readings taken while a veteran is using medication.  McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (holding that DC 7101 contemplates the effects of medication and therefore Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012) does not apply.  

Procedurally, as noted above, a September 2023 rating decision granted service connection for hypertension and the Veteran was assigned a noncompensable (zero) percent rating effective December 16, 2021.  A December 2023 rating decision again denied a higher rating for hypertension.  After this appeal was filed, a November 2024 rating decision increased the rating for hypertension to 10 percent effective March 14, 2024, the date of a VA examination.    

The Veteran presented for a February 2023 VA examination.  He was diagnosed with hypertension.  He reported that his condition has stayed the same since its onset.  He reported current symptoms of occasional "slivers in my peripheral vision when my [blood] pressure is high."  Her reported that he checks his blood pressure every other day and it is usually around 170-180 systolic over 90 diastolic.  

The Veteran's treatment plan included taking continuous medication for hypertension, which included taking 10 mg of amlodipine, and 25 mg of chlorthalidone.  The Veteran did not have a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more.  Blood pressure readings during the exam was 159 systolic over 89 diastolic, 146 systolic over 76 diastolic, and 138 systolic over 87 diastolic.  The Veteran's hypertension did not impact his ability to work.  

He presented for a December 2023 VA examination and was diagnosed with hypertension.  He reported current symptoms blurry vision and racing heart.  His treatment plan included taking continuous medication for hypertension, including taking 1mg of amlodipine.  The Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more.  Blood pressure readings during the examination was 146 systolic over 86 diastolic, 142 systolic over 84 diastolic, and 146 systolic over 82 diastolic.  His hypertension did not impact his ability to work.  

The Veteran was afforded a March 2024 VA examination for his hypertension.  However, the Board may not consider this examination as it took place after the December 2023 decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

Treatment records are consistent with the examination findings.  A September 2022 VA treatment showed reading of 181 systolic over 100 diastolic, and 138 systolic over 88 diastolic.  

A December 2022 private treatment showed blood pressure reading of 120 systolic over 80 diastolic.  A February 2023 private treatment showed reading of 122 systolic over 85 diastolic.  

An April 2023 VA treatment showed reading of 134 systolic over 86 diastolic.  An August 2023 and September 2023 VA treatment showed blood pressure reading of 134 systolic over 86 diastolic.  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension is not warranted.  While the Veteran reported 170-180 systolic readings, the remainder of the medical evidence does not support this assertion.  Also while the September 2022 treatment record showed a reading of 181 systolic over 100 diastolic, the remainder of the evidence does not show this level of reading during the appeal period. Notably, another reading that same day was not the same level.  One treatment record out of numerous readings does not amount to predominantly.  Also, the December 2023 examiner noted that Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more.  The Board notes that as the rating criteria for hypertension specifically considers the ameliorative effects of medication, those effects have been considered in evaluating the Veteran's disability. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2013) (holding the ameliorative effects of medication cannot be taken into effect unless specifically contemplated by the applicable diagnostic code).

When weighing evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence establishes that the Veteran's hypertension has been predominantly contemplated by a noncompensable rating, and no higher.  In reaching this decision, the Board also considered other applicable Diagnostic Codes for his hypertension.  However, a higher rating is not warranted under any other diagnostic code.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether entitlement to a compensable disability rating for his hypertension, is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a higher rating.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application). As such, the claim is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the December 2023 rating decision on appeal.  

The Veteran submitted a September 2021 VA 21-8941 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability and asserted that his service-connected disabilities prevented him from securing and following any substantial gainful occupation.  

When entitlement to a TDIU is raised during an appeal for an increased rating, it is considered part and parcel of the underlying increased rating claim. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 455 (2009).  In this situation, the claim for a TDIU has the same appeal period as that of the increased rating claim for hypertension, which goes back to December 16, 2021.   

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id. 

Since May 13, 2022, the Veteran was receiving a 100 percent combined evaluation.  For the period prior to May 13, 2022, the Veteran has the following disabilities that are service connected: left knee strain (rated 10 percent, from December 2021), and hypertension (rated noncompensable from December 2021).  

Based on the forgoing, the Veteran does not meet the percentage standards set forth in § 4.16(a). Therefore, the Board may not consider the claim for a TDIU in the first instance but will refer it to the Director, Compensation Service, if it is shown that the Veteran is unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). As described in Ray v. Wilkie, the correct standard for referral is whether there is "sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable by reason of his or her service-connected disabilities." 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019).  

During the July 2023 VA knee examination, it was noted that the Veteran's left knee functional impacted his ability to work.  It was noted that occupational tasks that required prolonged sitting, standing, or walking longer than 10 minutes would likely have a negative impact on the Veteran's ability to function in the workplace.  

For the period prior to May 13, 2022, the Veteran did not meet entitlement to a TDIU for a schedular basis, and the AOJ failed to address whether a TDIU on an extraschedular basis was warranted.  Thus, to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error, a remand is warranted.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Refer the Veteran's claim for a TDIU prior to May 13, 2022, to VA's Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).
