3.	The evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of an August 2, 2022, effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 2, 2022, for service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1969 to July 1971. 

This matter comes before the Board on a February 2025 rating decision. In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence which was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 2, 2022, for service connection for PTSD is granted. 

A February 2025 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD effective February 13, 2024. The Veteran, by and through his representative, asserts entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 13, 2024, for service connection for PTSD. 

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.? 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), 5110(b)(1);?38 C.F.R. § 3.400.?

Here, as to date of claim, the Board notes that a July 2019 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  Thereafter, a Supplemental Claim was filed December 21, 2022, and the claim has been continuously pursued since. On August 2, 2022, prior to the filing of the Supplemental Claim, an Intent to File (ITF) was received by VA. As such, the date of claim is August 2, 2022. 

As to the date entitlement arose, the Veteran's medical records document a diagnosis of PTSD as early as October 2019, which can be linked back to service. As such, the Board concludes that entitlement arose prior to the filing of the Veteran's August 2, 2022, ITF. Therefore, as governing law directs that the effective date must be the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, an effective date of August 2, 2022, is warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).
