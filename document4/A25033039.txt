DOCKET NO. 221006-284240
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In December 2024, VA was notified that the Veteran died earlier in December 2024.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of this appeal at this time. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 1967 to April 1971. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In that decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted entitlement to special monthly compensation based on the loss of use of both feet, effective August 3, 2022.

In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran disagreed with the effective date assigned in the September 2022 rating decision and elected the Hearing docket. 

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the Veteran. Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant." The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/. If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the Veteran's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).
