Entitlement to service connection for osteoarthritis of the right hip as secondary to service-connected osteoarthritis of the right knee.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from September 1980 to October 1984 and from February 2003 to September 2003.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2022 rating decision by a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a timely Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, VA Form 10182.  The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (i.e., May 31, 2022).  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  Because this case is being remanded, any evidence that is not considered by the Board at this time will be considered by the AOJ upon readjudication of this claim.

The Board observes the Veteran also attempted to appeal a March 2023 letter from the AOJ acknowledging the Veteran's December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ and requesting the Veteran to file his claim on a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.  The Board finds that this letter is not appealable to the Board because it is not a determination of entitlement or non-entitlement as contemplated by 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151(c), 20.200.  In this regard, the letter neither denies nor awards the Veteran's claim; it simply requests the Veteran to file an appropriate form for the benefit sought so that a determination of entitlement or non-entitlement can be made.  That letter is therefore not on appeal.  

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for osteoarthritis of the right hip as a result of his service-connected osteoarthritis of the right knee.  The Veteran attended a VA hip and thigh conditions examination in May 2022, in which the Veteran's diagnosis for osteoarthritis was confirmed.  

Unfortunately, the opinion accompanying the examination is inadequate.  Specifically, the Veteran claims entitlement to service connection on a secondary basis, but the examiner addressed only secondary causation, not secondary aggravation.  See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-41 (2013) (holding that when multiple theories of entitlement are at issue, the Board must ensure that the medical opinions of record directly address all theories reasonably raised by the record); Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74 (2018) (holding that aggravation and causation are independent theories of entitlement).  Accordingly, a pre-decisional duty to assist error exists, and a remand is necessary to obtain an adequate opinion.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (holding that once VA has provided a VA examination or obtained a medical opinion, it is required to provide or obtain one that is adequate for the purpose sought). 

The Board acknowledges the additional development taken on the Veteran's claim since the May 2022 rating decision on appeal that may obviate the need to obtain such an addendum opinion, including a March 2023 opinion concluding the Veteran's hip arthritis is a result of his knee arthritis.  In this regard, however, the Board is bound by the regulations concerning the evidence that may be considered in this appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

If the claim cannot be granted based on the evidence of record, including the March 2023 opinion, forward the claims file to a VA clinician to review and provide an addendum opinion regarding the Veteran's osteoarthritis of the right hip.  If an examination is deemed necessary to respond to the questions presented, one should be scheduled.  However, regardless of whether the Veteran appears for an examination or not, the examiner must provide the following requested opinions.

The examiner must address whether the Veteran's osteoarthritis of the right hip is (a) caused by, or (b) aggravated (i.e., worsened) by his service-connected osteoarthritis of the right knee, including the functional impairment caused by that disability.

A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  In this regard, the examiner is reminded that secondary causation and secondary aggravation are two different theories of entitlement, and that separate rationales must be provided for each theory.
