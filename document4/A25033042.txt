ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a mental disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a formal diagnosis of a current mental disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), that meets the DSM-5 criteria. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a mental disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 4.125.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from September 1978 to July 1984.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. §?3.2400(a)(1). The AMA applies to all initial decisions issued after February 19, 2019.  

The present matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) decision issued by VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Accordingly, this decision is subject to the AMA. 

In January 2024, the Veteran's claim for a mental disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), was denied. In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR). In June 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision.  

Next, the Veteran timely appealed the HLR decision to the Board in a July 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. Based on the Veteran's selection of the direct review docket, the Board may only consider evidence on record at the time of the June 2024 HLR decision on appeal. 

The Board interprets the Veteran's selection of the Direct Review option with an indication of a decision being rendered within 365 days as well as statements of record as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the claim finding that the Veteran does not wish to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

Service Connection?? 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). The absence of any one element will result in a denial of service connection.? 

Service connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).? 

Service connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence establishing a clear diagnosis of the disorder in accordance with?38?C.F.R. §?4.125(a), (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred, and (2) a link established by medical evidence between the current symptoms and an in-service stressor.?38?C.F.R. §?3.304(f).?? 

A diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38?C.F.R. §?4.125(a), which provides that all psychiatric diagnoses must conform to the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). 38?C.F.R. §?3.304(f).?? 

The pertinent regulation provides that, if the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and that the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor. See 38?U.S.C. §?1154 (b); 38?C.F.R. §?3.304 (f)(1).? 

For stressors unrelated to combat that are not based on fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, credible supporting evidence is necessary in order to grant service connection. Such evidence may be obtained from service records or other sources. See Moreau v. Brown, 9?Vet. App.?389 (1996). The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the regulatory requirement for "credible supporting evidence" means that "the appellant's testimony, by itself, cannot, as a matter of law, establish the occurrence of a non-combat stressor." Dizoglio v. Brown, 9?Vet. App.?163, 166 (1996). Therefore, the Veteran's lay testimony, is insufficient, standing alone, to establish service connection. Cohen v. Brown, 10?Vet. App.?128, 147 (1997).? 

Effective July 13, 2010, if a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  For purposes of this paragraph, "fear of hostile military or terrorist activity" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device (IED); vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror. See 38?C.F.R. §?3.304 (f)(3).? 

Service connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).? 

Service connection must be considered on the basis of the places, types, and circumstances of a Veteran's service as shown by his or her service records, the official history of each organization in which he or she served, his or her medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); and see Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).? 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §?3.102.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a mental disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

The Veteran contends that he has mental disorder related to his service. However, the Board finds that the record does not establish that the Veteran has a diagnosis of a mental disorder, to include PTSD, that conforms to the DSM-5. Thus, there is no current disability. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2024 where the examiner rendered no diagnosis for a mental disorder or PTSD under the DSM-5 criteria. The examiner provided a lengthy review of the Veteran's history and acknowledged the Veteran's reported stressor of being sexually assaulted by another service member and affirmed that markers were present that support the Veteran's contention regarding the assault. While the stressor was supported, the examiner opined that the Veteran did not meet the PTSD diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, the examiner asked the Veteran if he had any current mental health problems, and he denied experiencing any mental health problems. This opinion is thorough. The examiner considered the evidence of record and based the opinion on an accurate presentation of the evidence. Thus, the Board finds the examiner's opinion highly probative.

Moreover, there is no record evidence of any type of mental health treatment, nor is there evidence of a current diagnosis for PTSD or any other mental disorder. 

In the Veteran's case, service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis related to a mental disorder, to include PTSD. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has submitted a stressor statement to support his claim for PTSD; however, according to the January 2024 VA examination, that statement alone is not enough to support a diagnosis for PTSD. Additionally, VA treatment records show that the Veteran's most recent, PTSD and depression screens from December 2021 were negative. See April 2023 CAPRI records. Upon review of the private medical records, it is documented that the Veteran had no anxiety, depression, or panic attacks. See January 2024 JLV/MTF. 

With regard to the Veteran's assertions that he has a mental disorder, in Jandreau v. Nicholson, the Federal Circuit stated as follows: "[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional." Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). None of these factors are present in this case. 

During the appeal period, no medical professional has diagnosed the Veteran with a mental disorder nor is the Veteran competent to establish a diagnosis. In the instant case, the question of a psychiatric condition is not something that can be determined by mere observation.  Nor is this question simple.  While the Veteran is competent to report symptoms of depression or anxiety, the question of the cause of those symptoms is not an observable fact.  It requires clinical testing to assess and diagnose the underlying condition and training to make the appropriate interpretations and conclusions about what the testing demonstrates in conjunction with the symptoms reported to determine a diagnosis and a cause.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements as to any mental health symptoms are not competent evidence as to a psychiatric diagnosis. Further, the Board finds that the most probative evidence regarding whether the Veteran has a psychiatric disorder is the VA examiner's findings.

As such, the Board concludes that the Veteran has not had a diagnosed mental disorder, to include PTSD, at any time during the pendency of the claim or in close proximity to the date of claim. See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293-94 (2013).  The Court has held that Congress specifically limited entitlement to service-connected benefits to cases where there is a current disability. "In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim." Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Thus, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the claim of service connection for a mental disorder, to include PTSD. Accordingly, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim for service connection is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102.
