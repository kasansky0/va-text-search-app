ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus had its onset during active duty service.    

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1967 to February 1969.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for bilateral hearing loss, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection requires: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For certain chronic disorders, to include tinnitus, service connection may be granted if the disease becomes manifest to a compensable degree within one year following separation from service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  In such cases, the disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even if there is no evidence of such disease during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a); see Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus 

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus, which he contends was incurred in or caused by service due to military noise exposure.  The Veteran has stated that he first experienced an onset of tinnitus during service when he was exposed to jet engine noise as part of his duties as a jet engine mechanic.  He continues to experience constant tinnitus in both ears, which has progressively worsened since service.  See July 2024 VA examination report.      

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran is competent to describe the nature and extent of his in-service noise exposure.  See C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994).  As such, exposure to acoustic trauma during service is conceded based on the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of jet engine mechanic and his statements as to his military noise exposure.  Moreover, the Board notes that tinnitus is a type of disability that may be established on the basis of lay evidence alone.  Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  Therefore, there is no dispute that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus.

As such, the question remaining before the Board is whether the Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to his in-service noise exposure.  Based on a careful review the evidence, and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

The Board notes that the AOJ obtained VA examinations and medical opinions in July 2024 and August 2024.  However, the July 2024 examiner declined to provide an etiology opinion on the basis of speculation, noting only that service treatment records are silent for diagnosis or treatment for tinnitus.  The August 2024 examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus is less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure based on a finding of no evidence of tinnitus on active duty or at separation.  The Board finds the foregoing opinions to be inadequate because neither examiner considered the Veteran's competent lay statements of experiencing an in-service onset of tinnitus.      

In light of the above, the Board notes that the record does not contain an adequate medical opinion with regard to the etiology of the Veteran's tinnitus.  Nonetheless, the Board finds there is sufficient evidence in the record to decide the claim.  In the absence of an adequate medical opinion to the contrary, the Board accepts the Veteran's lay statement that his symptoms of tinnitus had their initial onset during service and have continued ever since.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that a veteran's statement is competent evidence as to events that are capable of lay observation).  In this regard, the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and to provide a history of when these symptoms began and whether the symptoms have been intermittent, continuous, or progressive in nature or severity.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469-70.  The Board finds these statements to be credible and consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's service and are uncontroverted by any other evidence of record.  See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469-70.

Based on the Veteran's competent and credible statement regarding the onset and continuity of his tinnitus symptoms, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's current tinnitus is related to his military noise exposure.  Accordingly, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the claim for service connection for tinnitus is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th at 780-81

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hearing loss, which he contends was incurred in or caused by service due to military noise exposure.  The Veteran's exposure to military noise has been conceded based on his MOS of jet engine mechanic.  

The Veteran underwent VA audiological examinations in July 2024 and August 2024.  At both examinations, the examiners reported CNT (Could Not Test) for all decibel levels for both ears in the audiometric examination results.  The examiners noted that pure tone testing was completed but results were unreliable due to poor inter-test reliability and/or inconsistency.  However, at the July 2024 examination, the speech discrimination score, which was valid, indicated a hearing loss disability in the right ear.  Despite this, an etiology opinion for the right ear hearing loss was not obtained.  

Despite the foregoing examination results, the AOJ did not obtain a new examination to attempt to confirm a currently-diagnosed left ear hearing loss disability, nor did it obtain an adequate medical opinion as to the etiology of the right ear hearing loss disability.  This constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination, it must provide an adequate one or, at a minimum, notify the claimant why one will not or cannot be provided).  Remand for correction of this pre-decisional duty to assist error is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Veteran is advised that any findings reported during the VA examination will be critical to the adjudication of his service connection claim.  VA's duty to assist is not a one-way street; he has an obligation to cooperate with VA in ensuring that duty is satisfied, through his attendance and full participation in any VA examinations scheduled on his behalf.  See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991).    

Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination with a VA audiologist to assess the nature and etiology of any currently-diagnosed hearing loss disability.  The examiner must review the claims file in its entirety, including this REMAND, and must note that review in the examination report.  All appropriate tests or studies should be accomplished, and all clinical findings should be reported in detail.  A complete history of symptoms should be elicited from the Veteran.

Thereafter, the examiner should provide a detailed medical opinion addressing the following:

(a) Is it at least as likely as not (i.e., the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any currently-diagnosed hearing loss disability had its onset during active duty service, within one year of separation, or is otherwise related to any in-service disease, event, or injury?

In providing the above opinion, the examiner should note that the Board has already conceded that the Veteran was exposed to acoustic trauma during service.  The examiner should also note that the Veteran was diagnosed with a right ear hearing loss disability at the July 2024 examination.  

The examiner must specifically discuss the Veteran's claimed in-service exposure to jet engine noise, after which he experienced tinnitus and hearing loss, as well as his contention that he was routinely exposed to hazardous noise due to his MOS of jet engine mechanic.   

The examiner is reminded that a lack of documented hearing loss during service cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative finding.  The Veteran's lay contentions must be considered and weighed in making the determination as to whether a nexus exists between hearing loss and military service.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for any opinion offered, citing to the examiner's own expertise, medical principals, and/or evidence in the Veteran's claims file, when necessary, to support the conclusion reached.  If the requested opinions cannot be rendered without resorting to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is caused by a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (i.e., no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), or by a deficiency in the record or the examiner (i.e., additional facts are required, or the examiner does not have the needed knowledge or training).
