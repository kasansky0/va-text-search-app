REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1952 to February 1954 including service in combat during the Korean War.  A grateful nation thanks him for his service.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c).

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 23, 2017, rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which denied entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and granted service connection for degenerative arthritis, lumbar spine with an evaluation of 20 percent effective March 21, 2017.  The Veteran's claims have been continuously pursued since the May 23, 2017, rating decision, most recently having been remanded by the Board for new VA examinations in October 2023, followed by a January 2024 rating decision which continued the Veteran's 20 percent rating for degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine, and continued the effective date of service connection for all six of the Veteran's separate lower extremity radiculopathy ratings from December 3, 2020. 

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran selected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the December 2021 rating decision and prior to receipt of the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Dates

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or a combination of injuries that is based upon the average impairment of earning capacities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its entire history, with emphasis upon the limitations proportionate to the severity of the disabling condition.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  When rating the Veteran's service-connected disability, the entire medical history must be reviewed.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  The Board must also fully consider the lay assertions of record.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

Where there is a question as to which of the two disability evaluations is applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence of record, any reasonable doubt remaining will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where service connection has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).

The Board acknowledges that multiple distinct degrees of disability might be experienced which result in different compensation levels from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Staged ratings apply to both initial and increased rating claims.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).  Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after a final disallowance will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(a).  

Relevant law states that, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.400(b)(2).  The effective date for an increased rating for disability compensation will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim.  If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Where a claim is subject to the modernized review system under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) based on date of initial claim or by election of the veteran, provisions exist that permit an effective date based on date of claim to be "preserved" following issuance of a decision.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500.  In particular, a veteran "may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing [an enumerated] administrative review [option]" following issuance of a decision by an AOJ, the Board, or the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h).  An effective date will be preserved if a veteran files for administrative review within one year of any decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  However, while the date of claim is preserved when a claim is continuously pursued, the proper effective date is still subject to a finding regarding when entitlement to the benefit sought arose.  In addition, an initial claim for an increased rating on VA Form 21-526EZ cannot establish continuous pursuit, regardless of whether it was received within one year of the issuance of the prior VA decision.  Id.  The reference above to "the date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought; this is determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (illio-inguinal nerve) is granted from May 24, 2017.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (femoral nerve) is granted from May 24, 2017.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) is granted from May 24, 2017.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (illio-inguinal nerve) is granted from May 24, 2017.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (femoral nerve) is granted from May 24, 2017.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) is granted from May 24, 2017.

The Veteran asserts that his left lower extremity radiculopathy of the ilio-inguinal, femoral, and sciatic nerve, and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the ilio-inguinal, femoral, and sciatic nerve began prior to December 3, 2020.  See December 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after a final disallowance will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(a).  

The Veteran first filed a VA 21-526EZ Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy in April 2017.  See April 2017 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).  The Veteran was first afforded a VA examination for radiculopathy on April 19, 2017.  The examiner found no radiculopathy on the April 19, 2017, VA examination.  See May 2017, C&P Exam. 

Following the April 19, 2017, VA examination, on a July 7, 2018, physician note, the Veteran complained of left lower back pain with pain radiating laterally.  The Veteran also had additional doctor visits where no radiating pain was noted.  See July 2018 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. 

The Veteran was afforded a second VA examination for his radiculopathy in December 2020.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran had diagnosed radiculopathy on May 24, 2017.  The Veteran stated he had radiating back pain into his legs and knees starting during the Korean War.  The examiner noted that in terms of radiculopathy, the Veteran had mild intermittent pain in both lower extremities.  See December 2020 C&P Exam.

In Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021), the Federal Circuit held that a veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance, or nearly equal, and does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise for benefit of the doubt to apply.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of May 24, 2017, for entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the ilio-inguinal, femoral, and sciatic nerve, and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the ilio-inguinal, femoral, and sciatic nerve, is warranted, as May 24, 2017, was the date of diagnosis of radiculopathy noted by the December 2020 VA examiner.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or a combination of injuries that is based upon the average impairment of earning capacities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its entire history, with emphasis upon the limitations proportionate to the severity of the disabling condition.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  When rating the Veteran's service-connected disability, the entire medical history must be reviewed.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  The Board must also fully consider the lay assertions of record.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

Where there is a question as to which of the two disability evaluations is applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence of record, any reasonable doubt remaining will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where service connection has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).

The Board acknowledges that multiple distinct degrees of disability might be experienced which result in different compensation levels from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Staged ratings apply to both initial and increased rating claims.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Entitlement to an increased rating for degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine (claimed as lower back), which is currently 20 percent disabling, is denied.

The Veteran's representative acknowledges the Veteran's range of motion shown during his recent December 2023 VA examination but argues that the surrounding statements on the December 2023 examination paint a more complete picture of the Veteran's back disability.  See December 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. 

The Veteran is currently service connected for degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine, rated at 20 percent disabling from March 21, 2017, under DC 5242.  

The rating criteria for musculoskeletal disorders were revised on February 7, 2021.  The amended regulations became effective on February 7, 2021, and claims that were pending on this date must be considered under both the former and revised criteria with the most favorable version applied to the claim.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76463 (Nov. 30, 2020).

Back disabilities are rated under either the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine or the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) based on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever method results in the higher evaluation when all disabilities are combined. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Under the current Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes, a 10 percent rating is assigned when IVDS causes incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least one week but less than two weeks during a 12-month period on appeal.  A 20 percent rating is assigned when IVDS causes incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least two weeks but less than four weeks during a 12-month period on appeal.  A 40 percent rating is assigned when IVDS causes incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least four weeks but less than six weeks during a 12-month period on appeal.  A 60 percent rating is assigned when IVDS causes incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least six weeks during a 12-month period on appeal.  38 C.F.R.§ 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.

An incapacitating episode is a period of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243, Note (1).

The general rating criteria for diseases and injuries of the spine and the formula for rating intervertebral disc syndrome based on incapacitating episodes remain unchanged under the new rating criteria.

Under the new criteria, DC 5237 still applies to intervertebral disc syndrome; but more specifically as this code is only to be assigned when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve root; DC 5242 is applied for all other disc diagnoses.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5243 (Effective February 7, 2021).

The evidence of record does not appear to show that the Veteran has experienced any IVDS during the period on appeal, and his degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine is not rated under the diagnostic code for IVDS.  No IVDS of the thoracolumbar spine was indicated on the Veteran's December 2023 VA back examination or in his medical records.  In addition, there is no evidence showing that the Veteran had been prescribed any bed rest due to his lower back disability.  Because the prescription of bed rest is a foundational requirement of a rating under this section of the rating schedule, the absence of any prescribed bed rest precludes a rating from being assigned under it.  As such, a rating based on IVDS is not appropriate, and it is therefore more beneficial to evaluate the Veteran's lumbar spine disability under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine for the period on appeal.

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted if forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; if there is muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness no resulting in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent evaluation is warranted if forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is not greater than 120 degrees; or if there is muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent evaluation is warranted if forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is 30 degrees or less or there is favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent evaluation is warranted if there is unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.

Normal ranges of motion of the thoracolumbar spine are flexion from 0 to 90 degrees, extension from 0 to 30 degrees, lateral flexion from 0 to 30 degrees, and lateral rotation from 0 to 30 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate V.

Unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretch.  Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Note (5).

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5242. Note (1).

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in the parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance.  It is essential that the examination on which ratings are based adequately portray the anatomical damage, and the functional loss, with respect to all these elements.  The functional loss may be due to absence of part, or all, of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective innervation, or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part which becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.10, 4.40, 4.45.  VA must analyze the evidence of pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, or incoordination and determine the level of associated functional loss in light of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40, which requires the VA to regard as "seriously disabled" any part of the musculoskeletal system that becomes painful on use.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).

Although pain may be a cause or manifestation of functional loss, limitation of motion due to pain is not necessarily rated at the same level as functional loss where motion is impeded.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011); cf. Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999); Hicks v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 417, 421 (1995); Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 592 (1991).  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45, the possible manifestations of functional loss include decreased or abnormal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, or endurance, as well as less or more movement than is normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, and pain on movement that affects stability, standing, and weight-bearing.  Therefore, in rating the severity of a joint disability, VA must determine the overall functional impairment due to these factors.  Consideration must include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight bearing and non-weight bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint.  Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016). (The spine has no opposite joint.)  Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).  VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.  Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 (avoidance of pyramiding) do not forbid consideration of a higher rating based on greater limitation of motion due to pain on use, including during flare-ups.  The guidance provided under DeLuca must be followed in adjudicating claims where a rating under the diagnostic code provisions governing limitation of motion should be considered.  However, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and 38 C.F.R. § 4.45, will only be considered in conjunction with diagnostic code provisions predicated on limitation of motion.  Johnson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 7 (1996).  The intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability.  It is the intention to recognize actual painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

The Veteran's medical records are absent for evidence of ankylosis.  

In response to the Board's October 2023 remand, the Veteran was afforded a new VA back examination in December 2023.  During the December 2023 VA back conditions examination, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) in November 2023.  No crepitus or localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint were shown.  Pain was evident on weightbearing, non-weightbearing, active and passive motion, and on rest/non-movement.  The pain caused functional loss described as difficulty bending over and picking up objects.  

Multiple range of motion measurements were taken during the examination and flare up measurements were the most limited and most favorable to the Veteran.  The flare up measurements were forward flexion endpoint: 50 degrees, extension endpoint: 15 degrees, right lateral flexion endpoint: 15 degrees, left lateral flexion endpoint: 15 degrees, right lateral rotation endpoint: 15 degrees, and left lateral rotation endpoint: 15 degrees.  No ankylosis of the spine was shown, and no IVDS was shown.  No guarding or muscle spasm of the thoracolumbar spine were noted.    The Veteran's functioning was not so diminished that amputation with prosthesis would equally serve the Veteran.  The Veteran used a brace and a cane to ambulate.  The functional impact of the Veteran's spine disability was noted as "struggles to bend over and pick up objects off the floor."  See December 2023 C&P Exam. 

In response to the question of whether the Veteran's back disability manifest unfavorable or favorable ankylosis of the thoracolumbar spine, as the functional equivalent of ankylosis during such instances can satisfy the criteria for a rating based on ankylosis, the examiner stated,

Veteran's exam today showed flexion of the lumbar spine at 75 degrees.  From his history and physical exam I do not believe that his flexion of the lumbar spine would be limited to 30 degrees or less; motion would likely be to about 50 degrees.  There is no medical evidence to show that he has no forward flexion of the spine.  Veteran does not have unfavorable or favorable ankylosis sufficient enough to stop him from functioning.  See December 2023 C&P Exam.

In response to the question of whether during flare up episodes forward flexion of the lumbar spine would be limited to 30 degrees or less, the examiner stated,

Flexion during flare ups most likely is limited to 50 degrees, but not less than 30 degrees.  There is no medical evidence to show that the Veteran has no forward flexion of the spine.  For the VA established diagnosis of degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease and lumbar spine there is no change in the diagnosis.  This has been confirmed on exam.  See December 2023 C&P Exam.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent at any time during the period on review.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  As noted above, the next higher 40 percent rating is warranted if there is forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less, or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  Here, there is no relevant medical evidence of record demonstrating that the Veteran's forward flexion is limited to 30 degrees or less during the period on review, as the most limited forward flexion was shown as 50 degrees.  Furthermore, neither the lay nor medical evidence of record establishes that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability has resulted in the functional equivalent of either favorable or unfavorable ankylosis (that his spine was fixed in flexion or extension, or that it was fixed in a neutral position).  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 23-24 (2021).  

While the Board acknowledges the difficulties associated with the Veteran's back pain, these difficulties have been considered adequately by the most recent December 2023 VA examination.
