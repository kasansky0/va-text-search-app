ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left foot pes planus is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran's claimed left foot pes planus had its onset during service or is otherwise related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for left foot pes planus are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.104, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2001 to September 2005. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In a August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for left foot pes planus is denied.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for left foot pes planus, which he asserts is related to his military service. See March 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that he experiences a sharp pain in the bottom of his left foot which makes it difficult to walk sometimes. See id.

Generally, to establish service connection, a claimant must show (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. See 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection also may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. 

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case, and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Regarding the first element of service connection, current disability, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) determined that the record does not show a current diagnosed left foot disorder. Upon careful review of the record, the Board also finds that there is no medical evidence of record indicating that the Veteran has a current diagnosed left foot condition, whether pes planus or another disorder. But as mentioned above, the Veteran asserts that he experiences a sharp pain in the bottom of his left foot which makes it difficult to walk sometimes. See March 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

Although the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms of his left foot condition, such as pain on motion, the record does not show that the Veteran is competent to provide an opinion as to diagnosis or etiology, as those require medical expertise and are outside the realm of common knowledge of a layperson. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4. Thus, the Board assigns the Veteran's lay statement some probative value regarding symptoms of a left foot disability, but no probative value as to diagnosis or etiology.

As to the second element of service connection, the Board must determine based on the evidence of record whether there was an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury. 

Turning to the relevant medical evidence, in-service records show that the Veteran specifically denied having any foot trouble and his feet were assessed as normal upon examination for purposes of enlistment. See December 2000 Report of Medical History; see December 2000 Report of Medical Examination. Further, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any complaints of, treatment for, or diagnosis of any foot condition. In a report of medical history during service, the Veteran denied any foot trouble. See January 2002 STR. Upon separation from service, the Veteran endorsed being in the same overall health as he was when he was assessed in December 2000, and regarding the intervening period between his December 2000 physical examination and separation, the Veteran denied having any illnesses or injuries that caused him to miss duty for longer than 3 days; having been seen or treated by a health care provider, admitted to a hospital, or had surgery; or suffering any injury or illness on active duty for which he did not seek medical care. See August 2005 STR (Report of Medical Assessment); see also August 2005 STR (Screening for Separation from Active Duty).

As for post-service evidence, the Veteran did not submit any post-service medical treatment records or identify any VA medical treatment facility at which he receives care. A VA search for any VA medical records associated with the Veteran yielded no results. See April 2024 Record; see also July 2024 Rating Decision. Further, the Veteran provided no lay statement regarding the onset of his left foot pain.

The Board notes that a VA examination relating to the left foot pes planus claim was not administered. Under McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), in initial service connection claims, VA must provide a medical examination where there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service; and (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for VA to make a decision on the claim. 

Here, the record does not support that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service with respect to the claimed sleep apnea. In fact, STRs are silent for any complaints of, treatment for, or diagnosis of foot problems, and the Veteran expressly denied any health issues at separation. A mere conclusory generalized lay statement that military service caused the claimed left foot condition is insufficient to require an examination under McLendon. See also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (2010) (rejecting appellant's argument that his "conclusory generalized statement that his service illness caused his present medical problems was enough to entitle him to a medical examination under the standard of [38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2)(B)]."). Accordingly, the Board concludes that a VA examination is not warranted in this case.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that there was an in-service incurrence or aggravation of or related to left foot pes planus. Thus, the Board finds that the second element of service connection is not met. Because the claim does not satisfy this element necessary to establish service connection, no discussion of the remaining element, nexus, is necessary. See Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006) (the absence of any one element will result in service connection denial).

Therefore, the criteria for service connection for left foot pes planus have not been satisfied, and the appeal is denied. 

In reaching the above conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the relevant evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable in this appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
