ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is proximately due to his service-connected hallux valgus, left foot.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran honorably served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1992 to December 1997. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. 

In July 2024, the Veteran timely submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), and requested Direct Review.

The Board may therefore consider only the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to his service-connected hallux valgus, left foot. See February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; February 2023 VA Form 21-4138; and July 2024 Appellate Brief. The Veteran asserts his service-connected hallux valgus keeps him from exercising, that he takes Advil, Aleve, Baclofen, Ibuprofen, Meloxicam, and Naproxen, that his service-connected condition causes him pain and makes it difficult for him to stay asleep or sleep on his side, and, consequently, that his weight has steadily increased. See February 2023 VA Form 21-4138. 

Service connection is available on a secondary basis when the evidence establishes that a veteran has a (1) current disability, (2) a separate, already service-connected disability, and (3) the current disability at issue is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated beyond its natural progress by the service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. As explained in greater detail below, the Board finds the probative evidence warrants entitlement to secondary service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. 

Here, the record confirms the Veteran has a current disability of obstructive sleep apnea. See September 2023 Rating Decision (favorable findings); April 2023 Sleep Apnea DBQ (Section I, Diagnosis); July 2023 Sleep Apnea DBQ (same) (received August 2023). The record also confirms that the Veteran has service connection for hallux valgus, left foot. See September 2023 Rating Decision (favorable findings); and September 2023 Codesheet. 

The remaining question for the Board is whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by one or more of his service-connected disabilities. There are multiple medical etiology opinions of record on this issue. Before considering the medical opinions, the Board briefly reviews the Veteran's history of physical measurements and findings. 

Here, the Veteran's in-service treatment records show he weighed 127 pounds shortly after enlistment. See January 1993 Report of Medical Examination. 

A report of medical examination from August 1994 showed that the Veteran weighed 137 pounds, and had a "slender" build. See August 1994 Report of Medical Examination. 

A March 1997 report of medical examination showed that the Veteran weighed 145 pounds, and also had a "slender" build. See March 1997 Report of Medical Examination. 

In contrast, VA medical records show that, in August 2021, the Veteran weighed more than 196 pounds, and had a body mass index (BMI) of 30. See August 2021 VA Sleep Medicine Note. 

Similarly, in October 2022, the Veteran weighed 194 pounds, and had a BMI of 30. See October 2022 VA Primary Care note. 

And more recently, in April 2023, the Veteran weighed 203 pounds, and had a BMI of 31. See April 2023 VA Primary Care Note. 

Turning to the medical opinions, a February 2023 private etiology opinion is of record. See February 2023 Private Medical Opinion. The February 2023 private medical examiner considered the Veteran's lay assertions, noted a thorough review of the Veteran's claims file, and provided citations to and excerpts from pertinent medical studies and literature. On review, the private medical examiner positively opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is secondarily due or related to, and or aggravated by the weight gain he experienced from his service-connected hallux valgus. The private medical examiner further opined that it is at least as likely as not that without the Veteran's weight gain his obstructive sleep apnea would not have occurred. As support for those opinions, the February 2023 private medical examiner explained that persistent pain and associated sleep disturbances from the Veteran's service-connected hallux valgus hindered his ability to be physically active, altered his metabolic and endocrine functioning, and led to his progressive weight gain and current obesity. The private medical examiner further explained that multiple studies document how obesity leads to changes in the upper airway, and that obesity is a major risk factor in development of obstructive sleep apnea. The Veteran's obesity therefore acted as an intermediate step between his service-connected disabilities and his obstructive sleep apnea. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 303-304 (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. The February 2023 private etiology opinion is highly probative, as it considers the Veteran's lay assertions, notes a thorough review of the Veteran's claims file, considers the Veteran's specific medical history, to include the role of his obesity as an intermediate step, and presents a compelling explanation on the development of the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea. 

In April 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination to evaluate the nature and etiology of his obstructive sleep apnea. See April 2023 Sleep Apnea DBQ. The April 2023 VA examiner met the Veteran for an in-person examination, noted a review of the claims file, and confirmed a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. See April 2023 Sleep Apnea DBQ at 1. The April 2023 VA examiner opined the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected hallux valgus, left foot. As support, the April 2023 examiner explained that obstructive sleep apnea and hallux valgus are separate and unrelated entities, and that a review of medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship. See April 2023 Medical Opinion (Section IV, Medical Opinion for Secondary Service Connection). However, the April 2023 VA examiner did not alternatively consider whether the Veteran's hallux valgus aggravated his obstructive sleep apnea, and a negative medical etiology opinion on secondary service connection is not adequate if it does not address both causation and aggravation. See El Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013). Moreover, the April 2023 examiner did not address the Veteran's particular medical history, and did not address obesity as an intermediate step. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 303-304 (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); and VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. As such, the April 2023 VA etiology opinion has only limited probative value.

In July 2023, the Veteran underwent another VA examination to evaluate the nature and etiology of his sleep apnea. See July 2023 Sleep Apnea DBQ (received August 2023). The July 2023 VA examiner met the Veteran for an in-person examination, noted a review of the claims file, and confirmed a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. See July 2023 Sleep Apnea DBQ at 1. The July 2023 examiner positively opined the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is at least as likely as not the result of weight gain associated with his inability to exercise due to his service-connected hallux valgus. See August 2023 Medical Opinion at 2 (Section IV), and 5 (Extra Remarks). The August 2023 VA examiner's etiology opinion is highly probative, as it considers the Veteran's lay assertions, is based on a thorough review of the Veteran's claims file, and considers the Veteran's particular medical history, to include the role of obesity as an intermediate step. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 303-304 (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. 

Weighing the record medical opinions against each other, the Board finds that the February 2023 private etiology opinion and the August 2023 VA etiology opinion carry significant probative weight on the issue of nexus. As discussed above, these opinions consider the Veteran's lay assertions, note a thorough review of the claims file, and evaluate the Veteran's particular medical history, to include the role of his obesity as an intermediate step. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).

In contrast, the Board finds no reason to accord more probative weight to the April 2023 VA etiology opinion, as that opinion did not consider whether the Veteran's hallux valgus aggravated his obstructive sleep apnea in the alternative, nor did that opinion address the Veteran's obesity as an intermediate step. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 303 (2020); El Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); and VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. 

The Board also gives consideration to the Veteran's lay assertions. A lay person is competent to describe pain, symptoms, events, and other matters capable of lay observation, and the Veteran is competent to describe his personal experiences and struggles with his service-connected hallux valgus, how his service-connected disability brings him pain and has reduced his physical activity, contributed to his weight gain and obesity, as well as his experiences with obstructive sleep apnea. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).

In view of the foregoing, the Board finds and concludes the competent, credible, and probative evidence of record persuasively establishes the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is proximately due to his service-connected hallux valgus, left foot.

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.
