DOCKET NO. 221021-289504
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On May 15, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran through his authorized representative have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from September 2001 to September 2006.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2022 higher-level review decision, following a March 2022 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

The Veteran elected the Board's Hearing docket. See October 2022 VA Form 10182. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 rating decision and any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). However, the Board notes that the Veteran withdrew this appeal prior to the requested Board hearing before a Veterans Law Judge. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

In the present case, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
