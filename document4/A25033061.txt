REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) based solely upon the service-connected Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Cannabis Use Disorder is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from May 2017 to February 2021.  

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which determined that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU was rendered moot by virtue of the Veteran's combined 100 percent schedular evaluation.  See September 2023 Rating Decision.  

Procedurally, a June 2022 decision granted service connection for Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Cannabis Use Disorder and assigned an evaluation of 50 percent, effective March 10, 2022, the date of the Veteran's claim for service connection.  See June 2022 Rating Decision; March 2022 Veteran's Application for Disability Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ).  In July 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, challenging the initial evaluation assigned the service-connected psychiatric disorder and also asserting that he was "unable to engage in substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected psychiatric condition."  

In September 2022, a higher-level reviewer at the RO awarded an increased initial 70 percent evaluation for the service-connected psychiatric pathology.  See September 2022 Rating Decision.  Additionally, regarding the TDIU issue, the higher-level reviewer identified a duty to assist error in the development of the claim and placed the issue in the Supplemental Claim lane pending additional development.  See id.  (reflecting that the "issue of individual unemployability was returned for correction of a duty to assist error" and further noting that the AOJ will develop for individual unemployability"); see also September 2022 Higher-Level Review Return (VA Form 20-0999) (noting that "the issue of TDIU has been inferred" based on the evidence indicating that he is unemployed as a result of service-connected disability or disabilities).  See, too, Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (holding that, when evidence of unemployability is submitted during the course of an appeal from an assigned disability rating, a claim for a TDIU will be considered part and parcel of the claim for benefits for the underlying disability).  Thereafter, a September 2023 supplemental claim decision declined to award a TDIU, finding that the issue was moot.  See September 2023 Rating Decision.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 supplemental claim decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the September 2023 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Finally, the Board notes that, in the September 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also attempted to appeal the August 2023 rating decision denying an effective date earlier than March 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Cannabis Use Disorder.  See VA Notification Letter dated August 2, 2023 (notifying the Veteran of the decision denying an earlier effective date and of his appellate rights); Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (VA Form 10182) received on September 11, 2024.  However, because the NOD was filed more than one year from the date of that denial, the appeal as to the effective date for the service-connected psychiatric pathology is untimely.  Accordingly, it is not before the Board at this time.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

1. Entitlement to a TDIU based solely upon the service-connected Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Cannabis Use Disorder is remanded.

As indicated in the introduction above, the September 2023 decision that forms the basis of this appeal concluded that the issue of entitlement to TDIU was moot because the Veteran's "service-connected disabilities are evaluated as 100 percent disabling and no potential entitlement to an earlier effective date for a total disability evaluation based on a grant of individual unemployability is warranted by the evidence of record."  See September 2023 Rating Decision.  

Notably, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled.  Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994) (citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990)).  Thus, if VA has found a Veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate that Veteran totally disabled on any other basis.  See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period); Locklear v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 311, 318, n. 2 (2011) (noting that the Veteran's award of a combined 100 percent schedular rating renders moot the issue of entitlement to a TDIU during that same period).

However, a grant of a combined 100 percent disability rating does not always render the issue of TDIU moot.  In this regard, VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities establish entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  Specifically, as relevant to the instant appeal, entitlement to special monthly compensation based on housebound status is payable where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  Moreover, a "single service-connected disability rated as total" under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is not limited to cases where a 100 percent rating has been assigned via the application of one or more diagnostic codes in the rating schedule; rather, entitlement to TDIU may serve as the "total" rating for the purposes of special monthly compensation at the (s) rate if the TDIU is predicated upon a single disability.  See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 291-94.

Here, the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent combined evaluation from March 10, 2022, the date of his claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder.  See September 2023 Rating Decision Codesheet; March 2022 Veteran's Application for Disability Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ).  See also 38 C.F.R. § 4.25 (combined ratings table).  However, the Veteran is not in receipt of special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) for any period on appeal.  Moreover, he has asserted entitlement to a TDIU based solely upon the effect of his service-connected psychiatric disorder on his ability to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment.  See, e.g., July 2023 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996).  Further consideration of TDIU is thus necessary.  See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 291-94 (2008); see also 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); Buie, 24 Vet. App. 250.  

Importantly, the AOJ recognized that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU based solely upon the service-connected psychiatric condition had been raised and required further development.  See September 2022 Higher-Level Review Return (VA Form 20-0999) (recognizing the issue of TDIU has been inferred based on the evidence from the VA[Medical Center] and [the VA psychiatric] examination [showing] that the Veteran has terminated employment at least in part due to [his psychiatric disorder] and [potentially other s[ervice-]c[onnected] conditions").  However, despite this, the AOJ failed to adjudicate the issue of entitlement to TDIU or conduct the necessary development as to the TDIU issue.  Instead, the AOJ ceased all development actions when it erroneously determined the issue to be moot.  See September 2023 Rating Decision.  This constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and a remand is thus required.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 20.802.
