DOCKET NO. 240325-426636

ORDER

The appeal for service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

The appeal for service connection for blurred vision is dismissed. 

The appeal for service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is dismissed. 

The appeal for a rating in excess of 20 percent for a duodenal ulcer disability is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's claim for service connection for hypertension, blurred vision, GERD, and a higher rating for duodenal ulcer disability was denied in a September 2016 rating decision.  The Veteran disagreed with the decision but failed to file a substantive appeal following the issuance of the May 2021 Statement of the Case.  Therefore, the September 2016 rating decision became final.  A Decision Review Request, Board appeal, filed in March 2024 is not a timely appeal. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of an appeal for service connection for hypertension, blurred vision, GERD, and a higher rating for duodenal ulcer disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from December 1988 to January 1992.

Under VA's former appeals system, referred to now as the Legacy system, a Veteran who disagreed with a VA decision on a claim for benefits must timely notify VA of his/her intent to appeal the decision within a prescribed time limit.  An appeal consists of a timely filed Notice of Disagreement, and after a Statement of the Case has been issued, a timely filed Substantive Appeal.  38 C.F.R. ยง 19.20.

A September 2016 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for hypertension, blurred vision, GERD, and a higher rating for duodenal ulcer.  The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement, and a May 8, 2021, VA issued a Statement of the Case.  The Veteran was sent a copy of the Statement of the Case on May 18, 2021, and according to the regulations in place at that time, he had either the later of the remainder of the one year period following the issuance of the September 2016 rating or within sixty days following the issuance of the Statement of the Case  to file a Substantive Appeal.  Thus, because the one year period following the Rating Decision had already passed, he had until July 18, 2021 to file any appeal.  

On March 6, 2024, more than sixty days after the Statement of the Case, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) which did not reference any specific rating decision; rather, it referenced the Veteran's claims for service connection for hypertension, service connection for blurred vision, service connection for GERD, and an increased rating for ulcers.  It appears that the Veteran selected this form to initiate a new claim for service connection and for a higher rating.  It, unfortunately, was not the proper form to initiate a claim.  

On March 27, 2024, the Board sent the Veteran an NOD Clarification letter asking which informed him that his appeal could not be processed unless he submitted another VA Form 10182 identifying the dates of decisions and specific issues that he was appealing.  On March 25, 2024, the Veteran submitted a new VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), which again did not reference any specific rating decision.  

Because the Veteran did not timely appeal the September 2016 RD and because his current form 10-182 does not reference a valid rating decision, the Board finds that the Veteran's March 25, 2024, appeal for service connection for hypertension, blurred vision, GERD, and an increased disability rating for service-connected duodenal ulcer disability must be dismissed.  

The Board notes that an October 11, 2024, rating decision subsequently granted the Veteran's claim for hypertension.  The Board's decision contained herein shall not disturb the favorable October 11, 2024, rating decision.
