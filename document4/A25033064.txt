DOCKET NO. 240219-419653
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 30, 2018, for the grant of service connection for herpes simplex virus I (herpes) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran served on active duty from February 9, 2016, to November 29, 2018; he has been service connected for herpes since November 30, 2018, the day following discharge from service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to November 30, 2018, for the grant of service connection for herpes have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. 

§§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2016 to November 2018.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from March 2023, October 2023, and February 2024 rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Regarding the rating decisions on appeal, the Veteran listed all three rating decisions as being challenged with respect to the issue of "effective date."  The March 2023 rating decision was issued in response to a November 2022 application for an increased rating; it granted a 60 percent rating for the Veteran's herpes effective November 21, 2022.  The October 2023 rating decision was a "special review" decision and awarded a 60 percent rating for the Veteran's herpes effective November 30, 2018.  Finally, the February 2024 rating decision was issued in response to a November 2022 higher-level review request after a February 2023 rating decision had identified a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  Importantly, the Veteran has been continuously pursuing his herpes claim since his June 9, 2019, initial application for service connection.  Thus, while the Veteran listed all three rating decisions as being on appeal, there is really only one issue presented - entitlement to an effective date prior to November 30, 2018, for the award of service connection.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to November 30, 2018, for the award of service connection for herpes.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have made any specific arguments as to why an earlier effective date should be awarded.

Unless specifically provided otherwise in the statute, the effective date of an award based on an original claim for compensation benefits shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 

38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be the day following separation from service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation, otherwise the date of claim or 

the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b); 38 C.F.R. 

§ 3.400 (b)(2).

The Veteran is currently assigned an effective date of November 30, 2018, for the award of service connection for herpes.  This date corresponds to the first day after he separated from service.  He is not entitled to service connection prior to separation.  The day following separation from service is the earliest possible effective date assignable to a grant of service connection.

As the Veteran is already assigned an effective date for the day after separation from service and there is no legal basis to grant an effective date that precedes his separation from service, the appeal is denied as a matter of law.
