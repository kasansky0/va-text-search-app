REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (femoral) is remanded.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity (femoral) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At the time of the March 2023 reduction, the evidence failed to show a material improvement in the Veteran's radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (femoral), or that any material improvement was reasonably certain to be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.

2. At the time of the March 2023 reduction, the evidence failed to show a material improvement in the Veteran's radiculopathy of the right lower extremity (femoral), or that any material improvement was reasonably certain to be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The March 2023 reduction of the disability rating from 20 percent to 10 percent for the radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (femoral) was not proper, and the 20 percent rating is restored, effective June 1, 2023.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5112, 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.344, 4.2, 4.10, 4.13, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8526. 

2. The March 2023 reduction of the disability rating from 20 percent to 10 percent for the radiculopathy of the right lower extremity (femoral) was not proper, and the 20 percent rating is restored, effective June 1, 2023.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5112, 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.344, 4.2, 4.10, 4.13, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8526. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service from December 1993 to December 1998.  

This appeal began with the Veteran filing an increased rating claim for his radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (femoral) on March 11, 2019.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) then issued a proposed rating decision to reduce the radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) to 0 percent.  An April 2020 rating decision finalized these proposed reductions and decreased the radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) to 0 percent, effective July 1, 2020.  In a September 2020 rating decision, the AOJ found clear and unmistakable errors (CUE) with the premature reductions conducted in the April 2020 rating decision.  The AOJ restored the 20 percent ratings for the radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral).  The AOJ then again proposed to decrease the disability ratings for the radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) to 0 percent in the September 2020 rating decision.  

In a March 2023 rating decision, the AOJ reduced the Veteran's ratings for the radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective June 1, 2023.  The March 2023 rating decision constitutes the initial decision, as this was the first actual reduction of the Veteran's disability ratings (the prior reductions were restored by CUE); therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

As an initial matter, the Board will address both the reduction and increased rating claims.  Generally, an appeal regarding the reduction of a rating must address only the propriety of the reduction, and not whether a veteran is entitled to a higher rating.  Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 279-80 (1992).  However, when filing a claim with VA, claimants are presumed to be seeking the maximum available benefit for their disability.  See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993).  In situations where the reduction stems from an original claim for a higher rating, the appeal may encompass not only the propriety of the reduction, but also the underlying claim for a higher rating.  Here, the reduction of the Veteran's radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) stemmed from the Veteran's March 2019 claim for increase.  See March 2019 VA 21-526EZ Form.  Further, on his April 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the Veteran indicated that he was appealing "assigned rating" for each claim.  Thus, in resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that it has jurisdiction over the increased rating and the reduction claims.

Further, the Board is adding the TDIU issue to the appeal, as will be discussed in the Remand section below.

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the March 2023 rating decision.  Although the Veteran initially requested HLR when submitting the April 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined in July 2023 that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  In February 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and increased the disability ratings for the radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) to 20 percent, effective August 11, 2023, based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Regarding the reduction claims, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the increased rating and TDIU claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. The propriety of the reduction of radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (femoral) from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective June 1, 2023.

2. The propriety of the reduction of radiculopathy of the right lower extremity (femoral) from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective June 1, 2023.

The Veteran generally contends that he is entitled to higher ratings.

By way of history, service connection was granted for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) in an August 2018 rating decision.  20 percent ratings were assigned, effective June 10, 2018, under Diagnostic Code 8526.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  The procedural history was described in the introduction.  However, in summary, this appeal arises from the March 2023 rating decision that reduced the disability ratings for the service-connected disabilities from 20 percent to 10 percent disabling, effective June 1, 2023. 

Where reduction in the evaluation of a service-connected disability is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction of current compensation payments, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).  The beneficiary will be notified at his latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefore, and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that compensation should be continued at the present level.  Id.  Here, the AOJ proposed the reductions from 20 percent to 0 percent in a September 2020 notification letter and in the September 2020 rating decision.  The September 2020 rating decision and associated notification that same month properly notified the Veteran of the proposed reductions including notifying the Veteran of the 60-day period to provide additional evidence and how to obtain a personal hearing in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i).  The Veteran requested a pre-determination hearing, and was afforded such hearing in January 2023 before a Decision Review Officer.  The transcript has been associated with the Veteran's electronic claims file.  The actual reductions to 10 percent for each extremity were subsequently effectuated by a March 2023 rating decision with an effective date of June 1, 2023.  Accordingly, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the specific procedural requirements applicable to the Veteran's rating reduction. 

Having determined above that the Veteran received proper notice of the proposal to reduce his unspecified depressive disorder rating, the Board notes that the remaining question is whether the reductions were proper.

In certain rating reduction cases, VA benefits recipients are to be afforded greater protections, set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.344.  These considerations apply to ratings that have continued for long periods at the same level (five years or more), and not to disabilities that have not become stabilized and are likely to improve.  In this case, the 20 percent disability ratings for the radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) had been in effect for less than five years at the time of the reduction.  Thus, the various provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344, pertaining to stabilization of disability ratings, do not apply in these appeals.

Nevertheless, there are several general VA regulations that apply to all rating reductions, regardless of whether the rating has been in effect for five years or more.  Brown v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 413 (1993).  Specifically, the evidence must reflect an actual change in a veteran's condition and not merely a difference in the thoroughness of the examination or in the use of descriptive terms.  38 C.F.R. § 4.13.  The evidence must show that the improvement in the disability actually reflects an improvement in a veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.10.  Furthermore, rating reduction cases must be based upon a review of the entire history of a veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Brown, 4 Vet. App. at 420-421.  In addressing whether improvement is shown, the comparison point generally is the last examination on which the rating at issue was assigned or continued.  See Hohol v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 169 (1992).

A rating reduction case focuses on the propriety of the reduction and is not the same as an increased rating issue.  See Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282, 286 (1991).  Significantly, in a rating reduction case, VA has the burden of establishing that the disability has improved.  To warrant reduction in rating, it must be shown that the evidence of record persuasively supports the reduction itself, and with application of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine under 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) as required.  See Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 420; Peyton, 1 Vet. App. at 286.  In determining whether a reduction was proper, the Board must focus upon evidence available to the AOJ at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of evaluating whether the condition has actually improved.  Cf. Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 280 (1992).  However, post-reduction evidence may not be used to justify an improper reduction.

Here, the 20 percent ratings were assigned for the Veteran's service-connected radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) under Diagnostic Code 8526 in the August 2018 rating decision.  The AOJ proposed the reductions from 20 percent to 0 percent in a September 2020 notification letter and in the September 2020 rating decision.  The actual reductions to 10 percent for each extremity were subsequently effectuated by a March 2023 rating decision with an effective date of June 1, 2023.

The Board is aware that it must make its determination as to whether improvement had been shown between (1) the medical evidence of record at the time of the August 2018  rating decision that granted the 20 percent ratings for the Veteran's radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral), and (2) the medical evidence used to reduce the disability ratings to 10 percent in the March 2023 rating decision.  After comparing the evidence, the Board finds that the AOJ's decision to reduce the Veteran's disability ratings from 20 percent to 10 percent was not warranted.  Hence, the 20 percent ratings for the radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) will be restored, effective June 1, 2023.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8526.

Paralysis of the femoral nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8526.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 30 disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

The evidence used to grant the 20 percent ratings for the Veteran's radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) included VA treatment records and a VA back conditions examination dated in July 2018.  Based on this evidence, in the August 2018 rating decision, the AOJ granted 20 percent ratings for each lower extremity under Diagnostic Code 8526.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

At the July 2018 VA back conditions examination, the Veteran reported back pain that radiates down his legs.  His sensory examination found decreased sensation to light touch testing in the bilateral upper anterior thigh, thigh/knee, and lower leg/ankle.  His right foot/toes sensation was normal, while his left foot/toes sensation was decreased.  His straight leg raising test was positive bilaterally.  The VA examiner found that the Veteran had mild constant pain bilaterally, and moderate intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness bilaterally.  The examiner determined that the femoral nerve was affected bilaterally.  Overall, the examiner found that the severity of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremities radiculopathy was best rated as moderate.

The VA treatment records dated prior to the August 2018 rating decision do not provide evidence contrary to that obtained at the VA examination.  

The Board must now compare the above findings, which were the basis for granting 20 percent ratings, with the evidence used to reduce the Veteran's disability ratings to 10 percent in the March 2023 rating decision to determine whether his service-connected radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) "improved."  The March 2023 rating decision primarily relied on a March 2023 VA peripheral nerves examination and VA treatment records, as the basis for the reductions.

At the March 2023 VA peripheral nerves examination, the Veteran reported back pain that radiates to the back and front of his thighs, knees, and legs, and causes him difficulty with walking.  He stated that he was being followed by pain management, and they had recommended starting him on the Percoset medication.  His sensory examination found decreased sensation to light touch testing in the bilateral thigh/knee, lower leg/ankle, and foot/toes.  His bilateral upper anterior thighs was normal.  The VA examiner found that the Veteran had mild constant pain bilaterally, and moderate intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness bilaterally.  The examiner determined that the Veteran had moderate incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerves bilaterally.  

The VA treatment records dated prior to the March 2023 rating decision do not provide evidence contrary to that obtained at the VA examination.

The Board is not persuaded, based on these treatment records and VA examinations, that the Veteran's radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) sufficiently improved to warrant reductions from 20 percent to 10 percent.  Both examinations document almost identical sensory examination data.  Further, the March 2023 VA examiner determined that the Veteran has moderate incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerves bilaterally.  20 percent ratings are warranted under Diagnostic Code 8526 for moderate incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerve.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  Finally, a VA peripheral nerves examination was not obtained following the March 2023 AOJ's reduction of the service-connected disabilities.

The evidence (both before and after the March 2023 rating decision) documents that the Veteran's radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) has been manifest by moderate incomplete paralysis.  Therefore, in resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the aforementioned evidence warrants 20 percent ratings under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8526.

Under these circumstances, the Board cannot conclude that the evidence of record persuasively supports a material improvement in the Veteran's service-connected radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral) that is reasonably certain to be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.  Accordingly, the Veteran is entitled to restoration of the 20 percent ratings for his service-connected radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral), effective June 1, 2023.  The claims are granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

This issue is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, which increased the radiculopathy of each lower extremity to 20 percent, effective August 11, 2023.  Prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran raised the issue of entitlement to a TDIU at the March 2023 VA peripheral nerves examination.  See March 2023 VA examination (in which the VA examiner found the service-connected radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities impact the Veteran's ability to work, in that he has limitations in prolonged walking, sitting, and standing).  Similarly, the Veteran was diagnosed, in part, with radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities at the August 2023 VA back conditions examination.  At this examination, the VA examiner determined that the conditions listed in the diagnosis section (which included the service-connected radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities) impact the Veteran's ability to perform any type of occupational task.  Specifically, the examiner stated that the Veteran would not tolerate employment requiring prolonged sitting, standing, walking, bending at the waist, and/or heavy lifting due to exacerbation of his lower back and lower extremity symptoms.  As a result of these VA examination reports, the AOJ did not add the TDIU claim to the current appeal under Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (holding that, when evidence of unemployability is submitted during the course of an appeal from an assigned disability rating, a claim for a TDIU will be considered part and parcel of the claim for benefits for the underlying disability).  

The Board recognizes that the Veteran is currently in receipt of a 100 percent combined schedular rating since July 12, 2018; however, the Veteran filed his increased rating claim in March 2019.  The Board has a duty to consider the one year period prior to the date of this claim (i.e., back to March 2018).  The claim of entitlement to a TDIU must also be considered back to March 2018.  Thus, the failure to add the TDIU claim to this current appeal is a pre-duty to assist error on the part of the AOJ.  The Board has added the TDIU issue to the appeal.  Upon remand, the AOJ should develop the TDIU issue.  

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity is remanded.

3. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity is remanded.

As a result of this Board decision, the Veteran is now in receipt of 20 percent ratings for his radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities for the entire appeal period.  To date, the AOJ has not adjudicated claims of entitlement to ratings higher than 20 percent for the entire appeal period for the radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities (femoral).  Therefore, the AOJ must adjudicate these increased rating claims, de novo, in the first instance, so as to avoid any prejudice to the Veteran.  See Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394, 399 (2010).  Thus, a remand is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty.

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Ask the Veteran to complete a TDIU claim form.

?

2. Adjudicate the issues of entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity and entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity, on their merits.
