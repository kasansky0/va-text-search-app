REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served from July 1968 to July 1971.	

In December 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the ankle and lumbar spine disabilities most recently addressed in a July 2014 rating decision.  

In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decisions on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window. 

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. 

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of bilateral ankle, low back, and traumatic brain injury disabilities, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900. 38 U.S.C. § 7107 (a)(2).

1. Service connection for a left ankle condition 

2. Service connection for a right ankle condition 

The Veteran seeks service connection for left and right ankle conditions. In an October 2021October 2021 VA opinion, the examiner opined the Veteran's bilateral ankle disability was related to service but provided no additional explanation or rationale.

The October 2021 VA examination report and opinion are inadequate for the purposes of a service connection determination. Failing to obtain an adequate examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. This duty to assist error should be remedied on remand by providing the Veteran an addendum opinion that includes an adequate opinion and rationale.

3. Service connection for a lumbosacral strain with muscle spasms

The Veteran seeks service connection for a low back disability. In an October 2021October 2021 VA opinion, the examiner opined the Veteran's low back disability was related to service but provided no additional explanation or rationale.

The October 2021 VA examination report and opinion are inadequate for the purposes of a service connection determination. Failing to obtain an adequate examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. This duty to assist error should be remedied on remand by providing the Veteran an addendum opinion that includes an adequate opinion and rationale.

4. Service connection for a right-frontal cortical brain-infarction 

The Veteran seeks service connection for a traumatic brain injury (TBI).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2024February 2024. The examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed TBI condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury but did not provide an adequate rationale to support the opinion. 

The February 2024 VA examination report and opinion are inadequate for the purposes of a service connection determination. Failing to obtain an adequate examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. This duty to assist error should be remedied on remand by providing the Veteran an addendum opinion that includes an adequate opinion and rationale.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's ankle disabilities are at least as likely as not related to in-service injury.

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's lumbosacral strain is at least as likely as not related to in-service injury.

3. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's claimed TBI is at least as likely as not related to service.
