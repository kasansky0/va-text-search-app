ORDER

A temporary total disability rating due to service-connected depressive disorder requiring convalescence or because of hospital treatment in excess of 21 days from June 20, 2021, to February 2, 2022, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran was not hospitalized and did not receive hospital observation at VA expense during his participation in an inpatient substance abuse rehabilitation program from June 20, 2021, to February 2, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a temporary total disability rating based on hospitalization for over 21 days for a service-connected disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 1156, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.29.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from Mary 1981 to April 1981 and the Army from October 1981 to September 1999. The Veteran is a Persian Gulf War Veteran with service in Southwest Asia.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision issued by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September August 2022 rating decision. In August 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 2022 decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to a temporary total disability rating due to service-connected depressive disorder requiring convalescence or because of hospital treatment in excess of 21 days from June 20, 2021, to February 2, 2022

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a total temporary disability rating due to in-patient substance abuse service received at Victory Addiction Center and Clearview Recovery Center due to his service-connected depressive disorder and associated alcohol use disorder. The Veteran acknowledges that he received private in-patient rehabilitation services for his non-service-connected alcohol abuse. See August 2024 VA Form 10182. However, he contends that his alcohol use disorder is secondary to his service-connected depressive disorder, and he received mental health treatment while participating in substance abuse rehabilitation programs. Id.

A total disability rating will be assigned when it is established that a service-connected disability required hospital treatment in a VA facility or other approved hospital for more than 21 days or for hospital observation at VA expense for a service-connected disability for more than 21 days. 38 U.S.C. § 1156; 38 C.F.R. § 4.29.

Domiciliary care is defined as either a temporary home to a Veteran, embracing the furnishing of shelter, food, clothing, and other comforts of home, including necessary medical services; or a day hospital program consisting of intensive supervised rehabilitation and treatment provided in a therapeutic residential setting for residents with mental health or substance abuse disorders, and co-occurring medical or psychosocial needs such as homelessness and unemployment.38 C.F.R. § 17.30(b)(1). As such, a Veteran may be eligible for benefits pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.29 if living in a residential treatment program was required while receiving hospital treatment in a VA hospital for a period more than 21 days for a service-connected disability.

The Board finds that a temporary total disability rating is not warranted for the Veteran's participation in residential substance abuse rehabilitation programs from June 20, 2021, to February 2, 2022, because they do not qualify as "required hospital treatment" or hospital observation at VA expense within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 4.29. 

The record establishes that, in June 2021, the Veteran was referred by the VA to private residential substance abuse rehabilitation treatment facilities for alcohol use disorder following his third driving while intoxicated (DWI) charge. See September 2021 Clearview Recovery Center (CRC) Treatment Note; June 2021 Victory Addiction Center (VAC) Treatment Note. The record also indicates that the Veteran's participation in these programs was not required by the VA. Specifically, the Veteran reported that that the reason for his admission was to get his treatment done before going to court for his 3rd DWI. See September 2021 VAC Discharge Note; June 2021 VAC Intake Note. 

Additionally, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) noted a distinction between domiciliary care and hospitalization and found that domiciliary care is not a component of "hospital care." Mangham v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 284, 288 (2009), see also Bartlett v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 328 (2011) (finding the term hospital care means care and treatment for a disability furnished to an individual who has been admitted to a hospital as a patient).

For guidance, the M21-1, VIII.iv.8.B.3.c. explains that, for the purposes of determining entitlement to a temporary total evaluation for hospitalization, the decision maker should focus on what types of services the Veteran received and not whether one specific type of program would qualify for benefits. Only treatment consistent with hospital care warrants an award of benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 4.29. While the Board is not bound by the M21-1, its provision may be relevant to the determination at hand and entitled to consideration by the Board. See Overton v. Wilkie, 38 257, 263 (2018); see also Nat'l Org. of Veterans' Advocates, Inc. v. Sec'y of Veterans Affs, 981 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (holding that M21 provisions may, under certain circumstances, be reviewable under the Administrative Procedures Act, while acknowledging that M21-1 provisions are not binding on the Board); McDaniel v. McDonough, 24 U.S. App. Vet. Claims Lexis 321 (the Board is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual, M21-1, as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons and bases and notwithstanding its non-binding nature, an agency cannot simply ignore an internal guidance manual when its contents relate to a particular claim.)

The M21-1 directs that the nature of the services provided, rather than the specific type of program should be the focus. However, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 17.30(b)(1), "domiciliary care" includes a "day hospital program" for substance abuse disorders, which would entail analysis of the specific program providing the treatment to the Veteran. Regardless, whether reviewing the services the Veteran received or the type of program the Veteran entered, the Board does not find that the Veteran received treatment from a domiciliary treatment program that was consistent with hospital care for his service-connected depressive disorder.

Although the Veteran continued to receive medication for his service-connected depressive disorder, as well as some mental health counseling, the Board does not find the program to be more medical in nature, such as would be found in an inpatient hospital setting. There is no indication that the physicians directed the Veteran's care as would occur in a hospital setting. The Veteran was not treated in a hospital setting. The overall treatment the Veteran received, and was engaged in, involved rehabilitative-type services that included medication monitoring, recovery education, and participation in substance abuse and mental health groups, individual therapy sessions, educational classes, lectures, and activities. See, e.g., a September 2021 treatment record. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that this type of treatment is more consistent with residential care, as opposed to inpatient hospital care, or a "day hospital program" referenced under 38 C.F.R. § 17.30(b)(1). Moreover, there is no indication that the Veteran was confined to the treatment facility during his stay. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the Veteran's treatment at Victory Addiction Center and Clearview Recovery Center between June 20, 2021, and February 2, 2022, and the overall programs themselves, are not consistent with hospital care, hospitalization, or hospital observation at VA expense.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's representative argues that the Veteran's alcohol use disorder is secondary to his service-connected depressive disorder and that the Veteran received mental health services while participating in the aforementioned residential substance abuse programs. See August 2024 VA Form 10182. However, the Board need not address these theories of entitlement on the merits because the Board has determined that the Veteran's residential substance abuse treatment from June 20, 2021, to February 2, 2022, is not consistent with "required hospital care" or a "day hospital program" within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 4.29. Additionally, the Board notes, and the Veteran has acknowledged, that Veteran is not service-connected for any substance abuse disorder. The Veteran is free to file a claim seeking service connection for a substance abuse disorder, to include as secondary to his service-connected depressive disorder.

The Board finds that the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran was hospitalized from June 20, 2021, to February 2, 2022, within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 4.29. As the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, entitlement to a temporary total disability rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.29 is denied.
