REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected anxiety disorder, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2011 to May 2015.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to service-connected anxiety disorder, is remanded.

The Veteran asserts she is entitled to service connection for sleep apnea. In her claim application submitted in September 2023, the Veteran reported having trouble remaining asleep due to trouble breathing, that she has had problems with breathing since being on a ship in service, and that she had to block out black debris while on the ship. 

In a December 2023 rating decision, the RO favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, and participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the RO to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the RO decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other RO error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

The Veteran was afforded a VA sleep apnea examination in October 2023. She reported that for the past seven or eight years, she has had difficulty falling asleep, has been told that she snores, and feels tired. Due to an inadequate nexus opinion provided by the October 2023 VA examiner, the RO issued a Higher-Level Review Return form and instructed that an examiner opine whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is due to or aggravated by service-connected anxiety disorder. A toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) nexus opinion was provided in December 2023, and a secondary nexus opinion was provided in August 2024. However, the August 2024 VA examiner did not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is aggravated by service-connected anxiety disorder. 

Additionally, the Board finds that a direct medical opinion should have also been obtained to assess whether the Veteran's sleep apnea onset during service. As noted above, she reported in 2023 that she has had sleep problems for approximately seven or eight years, which places the onset of symptoms around her service separation in 2015.

The Board finds that the failure to obtain direct and aggravation nexus opinions constitutes a duty to assist error that must be corrected on remand.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is at least as likely as not related to and/or onset during service. The examiner must review the claims file and consider the Veteran's reports of the onset of her sleep apnea symptoms. Sufficient rationale for the opinion must be provided. 

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is at least as likely as not aggravated by service-connected anxiety disorder. The examiner must review the claims file. Sufficient rationale for the opinion must be provided.
