DOCKET NO. 240712-456219
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for a head injury is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) expressed disagreement with a March 2024 rating decision that denied service connection for PTSD and a July 2024 higher-level review decision that determined that a difference of opinion had been asserted and returned the PTSD claim for further development. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) subsequently granted service connection for PTSD in a September 2024 rating decision.

2. The Veteran's July 12, 2024, VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) seeks to appeal the rating decision for which the notification was sent to the Veteran on June 23, 2023. 

3. No good cause has been shown that would permit the Board to extend the one-year filing period and the Board did not waive (implicitly or explicitly) the timeliness of the VA Form 10182.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal seeking service connection for a head injury have been met 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 20.203(c). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2018 to September 2020.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from June 2023, March 2024, and July 2024 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted. 

The Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) expressed disagreement with a March 2024 rating decision that denied service connection for PTSD and a July 2024 higher-level review decision that determined that a difference of opinion had been asserted and returned the PTSD claim for further development. See Rating Decision - Narrative, March 2024 and July 2024. 

The AOJ subsequently granted service connection for PTSD in a September 2024 rating decision. See Rating Decision - Narrative, September 2024. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a head injury is dismissed. 

On June 22, 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision that, in relevant part, denied entitlement to service connection for a head injury. See Rating Decision - Narrative, June 2023. Notification of the rating June 22, 2023, rating decision was sent to the Veteran on June 23, 2023. See Notification Letter, June 23, 2023. 

On July 12, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement).

The Veteran's claim falls under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). VA regulations, under the AMA, require that a properly completed notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182) must be received within one year from the date that the AOJ mailed the notice of the decision being appealed. The date of the mailing of the letter of notification of the decision will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).

Here, the Veteran's notification letter for the June 22, 2023, rating decision was dated June 23, 2023. The letter notified the Veteran that if he did not agree with the decision, he had one year from the date of the letter to select a review option and submit the required application. The notification letter provided the Veteran with information regarding the available review options and the respective required application forms. 

The Veteran did not file a supplemental claim, request higher-level review, or initiate a Board appeal within one year of the June 23, 2023, rating decision notification letter. Therefore, the June 2023 rating decision became final. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103. 

The Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182 identified the rating decision issued on June 22, 2023. However, the notice of disagreement was received more than one year after the notification of the rating decision, and is, therefore, untimely.

The Board has considered the applicability of any waiver that would permit extending the filing period but finds no such evidence. See Ferko, 37 Vet. App. at 269; Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 332 (2021) (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45 (2009) (VA may implicitly or explicitly waive any issue of timeliness in the filing of a Substantive Appeal). The Veteran did not file a motion for an extension and has not provided good cause to extend the filing period, and no other arguable waiver is applicable here. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 20.203(c) (permitting an extension of the deadline to file a notice of disagreement for good cause shown).

The Board has also considered whether it waived any procedural defects by virtue of docketing the AMA appeal. See, e.g., Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46-47 (finding VA waived any objection to the timeliness of the legacy substantive appeal because "VA consistently treated th[e] matter as if it was part of the timely filed Substantive Appeal" for over five years). The Veteran filed his VA Form 10182 on July 12, 2024. The Board sent a letter in on July 28, 2024, acknowledging receipt of the Veteran's VA Form 10182 and placement of the appeal on the Direct Review Docket. The Board finds that this letter acknowledging receipt and the mere administrative act of assigning the attempted appeal a docket, in and of itself, does not constitute a waiver of procedural defects.

Based on the foregoing, as no good cause has been shown and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made as to the July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Board finds the July 2024 VA Form 10182 was, and remains, untimely.

There was no appealable decision within one year prior to the July 2024 VA Form 10182 related to the issue of entitlement to service connection for a head injury, and the appeal must be dismissed for failure to comply with the foregoing claims processing rules.

The Veteran is free to file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) along with new and relevant evidence should he wish to further pursue his claim for service connection for a head injury. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.
