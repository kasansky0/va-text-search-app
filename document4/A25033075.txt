ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of October 23, 2018, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran has continuously pursued a disability rating claim that included entitlement to a TDIU since October 23, 2018.

2. The evidence of record favors a finding that, from October 23, 2018, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have prevented the Veteran from securing and following gainful employment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the assignment of a TDIU effective October 23, 2018, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c), 4.16(a).  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from August 1999 to June 2004.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  The December 2023 rating decision was a higher-level review (HLR) of a March 2023 rating decision that, in pertinent part, granted entitlement to a TDIU, effective December 28, 2020. 

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to an effective date of October 23, 2018, for the award of a TDIU is granted.  

The AOJ has awarded entitlement to a TDIU, effective December 28, 2020, recognizing that the benefit sought had been part of the Veteran's claims for increase received on that day, and continuously pursued since that time.  The Veteran and his attorney argue that the TDIU claim had been part and parcel with rating claims that were pending since October 23, 2018, and that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have rendered him unable to secure or follow gainful employment since that time.  Indeed, the Veteran's attorney has specifically requested the assignment of an effective date of October 23, 2018, for the award of a TDIU.  See the Veteran's December 2023 VA Form 10182 and attached brief.  For the reasons discussed below, the Board agrees and will award the benefit sought.

By way of background, VA received an intent to file from the Veteran on October 23, 2018.  Within one year, in January 2019, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ requesting compensation for lower extremity neuropathy, among other conditions.  In an April 2019 rating decision, the AOJ awarded separate 10 percent disability ratings for radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremity, respectively, effective October 23, 2018.  

Within one year of the April 2019 rating decision, the Veteran filed a June 2019 VA Form 21-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.  On the form, the Veteran requested reconsideration of the ratings for his right and left lower extremity radiculopathy.  In Box 15 of the form, the Veteran specifically identified additional medical records from the Houston VA Medical Center and the Katy Community Based Outpatient Clinic he wanted the AOJ to obtain in support of his supplemental claim.  The Veteran's filing included, in pertinent part, his name, the benefit sought, his signature, and identification of potentially new evidence.  As such, the filing constituted a substantially complete application under 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(3).  

VA has a duty to assist claimants in obtaining evidence to substantiate all substantially complete initial and supplemental claims.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 3.2501(c).  In determining whether new and relevant evidence is presented or secured, VA will consider any VA treatment records reasonably identified by the claimant.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. 

In a June 26, 2019, letter to the Veteran, the AOJ rejected the Veteran's June 2019 supplemental claim, noting that it was incomplete.  The AOJ requested that the Veteran provide new and relevant evidence within 60 days, apparently overlooking the fact that the Veteran had already identified potentially new evidence on his supplemental claim form.  The AOJ ultimately obtained the Veteran's updated records of VA care in August 2019, but did not otherwise issue a decision addressing the Veteran's June 2019 reconsideration request or inform the Veteran whether the evidence he identified on his June 2019 supplemental claim was new and relevant warranting readjudication.   

On December 28, 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, again requesting higher ratings for his service-connected right and left lower extremity radiculopathies.  In a March 2021 rating decision, the AOJ characterized the Veteran's December 28, 2020, claim as a supplemental claim, and adjudicated all issues on their merits.  The AOJ continued the 10 percent ratings in effect for the Veteran's radiculopathies.  

Within one year of the March 2021 rating decision, on February 11, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting review of the March 2021 decision as it pertained to his radiculopathies.  With the form, he submitted a November 2021 independent medical evaluation of his radiculopathy. 

In a July 2022 rating decision, the AOJ again continued the 10 percent ratings in effect for the Veteran's right and left lower extremity radiculopathies.   In September 2022, the Veteran requested a HLR of the July 2022 rating decision.   The AOJ issued a HLR decision in November 2022, increasing the Veteran's ratings from 10 to 20 percent for each leg respectively, both effective December 28, 2020.  

Within one year of the November 2022 HLR decision, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.   He specifically identified his right and left lower extremity radiculopathies as disabilities that contribute to his inability to secure or follow gainful employment.  The AOJ accepted the claim as one for increase for all service-connected disabilities, in addition to a claim for a TDIU.  In the above-referenced March 2023 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 20 percent ratings for the Veteran's radiculopathies, but awarded entitlement to a TDIU effective December 28, 2020, based, in part, on the disabling effects of his radiculopathies.   In August 2023, the Veteran filed a HLR request as to the assigned effective date for the TDIU award.  The AOJ denied the downstream effective date claim in the December 2023 rating decision on appeal.  The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, requesting Board review of the issue.

In general, the effective date of an award of increased compensation will be the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the administrative review options, as specified under the AMA, after any decision by the agency of original jurisdiction.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  

TDIU claims are claims for increased compensation, and in this case, the AOJ has already favorably determined that entitlement to a TDIU was raised during the pendency of a claim for higher radiculopathy ratings that was continuously pursued from December 28, 2020.  As such, when awarding entitlement to a TDIU, the AOJ made the award effective the date VA received the Veteran's December 28, 2020, claim for increase. 

After reviewing the record, the Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued a claim for higher ratings for his radiculopathies-to which the TDIU claim is attached-since the date of his October 23, 2018 claim.  Indeed, the only potential break in the chain of timely requests for review between the October 23, 2018, claim and the AOJ's decision to award a TDIU occurred when the AOJ failed to recognize the Veteran's June 2019 supplemental claim as substantially complete.  As discussed above, the AOJ rejected the June 2019 filing, when it, instead, should have secured the new evidence the Veteran identified on the supplemental claims form, and issued a decision in response.  Because the Veteran filed a timely substantially complete supplemental claim with the AOJ in June 2019, which the AOJ improperly rejected, the Board finds that the June 2019 supplemental claim remained pending until the AOJ readjudicated the merits of the radiculopathy rating issues in its March 2021 rating decision.  Having made this determination, the Board accordingly finds that the Veteran's October 23, 2018, claim for higher radiculopathy ratings was continuously pursued until the AOJ ultimately granted entitlement to a TDIU, based in part on the disabling effects of his radiculopathies, in the March 2023 rating decision.  

Having established October 23, 2018, as the date of claim, the next question is whether the evidence shows that entitlement to a TDIU arose as of that date. 

A total disability rating for compensation may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and that if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and the combined rating must be 70 percent or more.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

For the time period from October 23, 2018 to December 28, 2020, service connection was in effect for the following disabilities: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), rated 50 percent disabling; chronic sinusitis, rated 30 percent disabling; a lumbar strain with bulging disc, rated 20 percent disabling; radiculopathy of the right lower extremity, rated 10 percent disabling; radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, rated 10 percent disabling; and pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), rated noncompensable.  A combined 80 percent rating was assigned.  Based on these ratings, the Veteran met the schedular eligibility requirements for a TDIU as of October 23, 2018.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. The economic component requires a determination as to whether a Veteran's income exceeds the poverty threshold. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a Veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. With regard to the latter component, attention should be given to the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training. Consideration should also be given to both the Veteran's physical and mental abilities. From a physical standpoint, possible relevant factors include the Veteran's limitations as to lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, and reaching, as well as audio and visual limitations. Regarding the Veteran's mental ability, possible relevant factors include limitations as to memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019). In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration should not be given to the Veteran's age or to any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

As stipulated on his VA Form 21-8940, and discussed in a November 2022 expert medical opinion, the Veteran has not worked for several years prior to his October 2018 claim.  He previously worked as a fueler at a retail distribution center.  Regarding education, he completed high school, took some college classes but did not earn a college degree.

Notably, a Counseling Record from VA's Vocational Rehabilitation Program dated October 23, 2018, indicated that, even at that time, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities significantly impaired his ability to prepare for, obtain and/or retain suitable employment.  His disabilities placed him at an employment disadvantage compared to similarly circumstanced Veterans.  The counselor noted that, due to the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, he was unable to obtain, maintain or prepare for specific employment in the labor market that does not aggravate his service-connected disabilities.  The counselor concluded that the Veteran had not overcome his impairment to employability.  

The Board finds no other evidence of record, lay or medical, that calls into question the assessment of the October 2018 vocational counselor.  After considering the evidence of record, as well as the statements of argument provided by the Veteran's attorney in a December 2023 brief, the Board finds that as of October 23, 2018, the Veteran was already unemployable due to the disabling effects of his service-connected disabilities.  Thus, the Veteran's TDIU award is warranted, effective October 23, 2018, consistent with the date VA received the Veteran's claim.

The Board adds that it is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's disabilities became so severe as to preclude employment specifically during the one-year period prior to the October 23, 2018, claim.  As noted above, the Veteran stopped working several years prior to filing the October 2018 claim.  The Veteran has specifically argued, and the evidence supports a finding, that his service-connected disabilities prevented him from working before the one-year look-back period.

Thus, entitlement to a TDIU cannot be made effective at any time between October 23, 2017 and October 22, 2018 under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §  3.400(o)(2).
