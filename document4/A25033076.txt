REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1969 to July 1970.  

This appeal comes before the Board from an August 2019 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  On a May 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  On March 11, 2024, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.

Therefore, regarding the claims on appeal, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2019 AOJ decision on appeal, and any evidence submitted by the Veteran or the representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the hearing request withdrawal, the Board did not consider that evidence in this decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that the Veteran filed claims for service connection for cataracts and hypertension, and a higher rating for diabetes mellitus in September 2019.  A rating decision was issued in January 2020 and the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement in May 2020, electing the hearing docket.  However, in March 2024, the appellant withdrew the request for an optional hearing before the Board.  Those claims will be addressed in a different Board decision under a different docket number.

Additionally, the Board notes that the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for service connection for sleep apnea in October 2020.  A rating decision was issued in January 2021 and the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement in March 2021, electing the hearing docket.  However, in April 2024, the appellant withdrew the request for an optional hearing before the Board.  That claim will be addressed in a different Board decision under a different docket number.

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to a service-connected disability, is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy, claimed as secondary to diabetes mellitus, is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy, claimed as secondary to diabetes mellitus, is remanded.

4. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is remanded.

5. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is remanded.

The VA treatment records currently in evidence contain notations indicating that a VA employee scanned medical records into a VA hospital imaging system, but do not contain any copies of the scanned records.  The Board notes that this includes both VA treatment records that were created prior to the issuance of the August 2019 AOJ decision on appeal and records submitted by the Veteran during the 90-day period following VA's receipt of the Veteran's March 11, 2024, withdrawal of the hearing request.  Any treatment records scanned into a VA hospital's imaging system are within VA's constructive possession and are considered potentially relevant to the issues on appeal.  Remand is required to allow VA to obtain those records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain the outstanding VA treatment records.  Specifically, obtain records noted as having been scanned into the Vista imaging system by VA Medical Center personnel, as noted in the VA treatment records in evidence, dated May 11, 2022; May 19, 2021; January 25, 2021; October 22, 2015; and September 28, 2011.
