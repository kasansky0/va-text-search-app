ORDER

Termination of entitlement to nonservice-connected pension benefits effective October 1, 2022, was improper; the appeal is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

VA did not comply with the procedural due process requirements prior to terminating nonservice-connected pension benefits.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Termination of the Veteran's nonservice-connected pension effective October 1, 2022, was improper and is void ab initio. 38 U.S.C. § 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.105(h), (i).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1993 to November 1995 with additional service in the Army National Guard from November 1995 to February 2001. 

The decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal. Id. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As the Board is deciding the claim, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c). 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b).

Pension Benefits & Adjustments

Basic entitlement to pension exists if, among other things, the claimant's income is not in excess of the maximum annual pension rate (MAPR) specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.23. 38 U.S.C. § 1521; 38 C.F.R. § 3.3(a)(3). The maximum annual rates of improved pension are specified in 38 U.S.C. §§ 1521 and 1542, as increased from time to time under 38 U.S.C. § 5312. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.21. The MAPR is revised every December 1st and is applicable for the following 12-month period.

In determining annual income, all payments of any kind or from any source (including salary, retirement or annuity payments, or similar income, which has been waived) shall be included during the 12-month annualization period in which received, except for listed exclusions. 38 U.S.C. § 1503(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.271(a).

For purposes of calculating pension benefits, total income may be reduced by amounts equal to amounts paid by a claimant for unreimbursed medical expenses that were "in excess of five percent of the applicable maximum annual pension rate or rates... as in effect during the 12-month annualization period in which the medical expenses were paid." 38 C.F.R. § 3.272(g)(1)(iii).

In essence, VA subtracts the total amount of countable income in one year, less excluded income, from the MAPR for that year; then, if a positive amount remains, the rest is divided by twelve to determine the monthly pension benefit. When a change in the MAPR occurs, the Board repeats the calculation with the new MAPR as the starting amount. 38 C.F.R. § 3.273(b)(1). When a change in income occurs, the MAPR will be reduced by the new annualized income effective on the date that the increased income began. 38 C.F.R. § 3.273(b)(2).

Whenever there is a change in a beneficiary's applicable MAPR, the monthly rate of pension payable shall be computed by reducing the new applicable MAPR by the beneficiary's countable income on the effective date of the change in the applicable MAPR and dividing the remainder by 12. 38 C.F.R. § 3.273(b)(1). Whenever there is a change in a beneficiary's amount of countable income, the monthly rate of pension payable shall be computed by reducing the beneficiary's applicable MAPR by the beneficiary's new amount of countable income on the effective date of the change in the amount of income, and dividing the remainder by 12. 38 C.F.R. § 3.273(b)(2).

Every claimant has the right to written notice of the decision made on his or her claim, the right to a hearing, and the right of representation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(a). Except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(3), no award of compensation, pension, or dependency and indemnity compensation shall be terminated, reduced, or otherwise adversely affected unless the beneficiary has been notified of such adverse action and has been provided a period of 60 days in which to submit evidence for the purpose of showing that adverse action should not be taken. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(2). 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(3) states that in lieu of advance notice and opportunity for a hearing, VA will send a written notice to the beneficiary or his or her fiduciary at the same time it takes an adverse action if an adverse action is based solely on factual and unambiguous information or statements as to income, net worth, or dependency or marital status, failure to return a required eligibility verification report, evidence reasonably indicates that a beneficiary is deceased, the beneficiary renounces VA benefits, the beneficiary returns to active service, or due to garnishment. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(3)(i)-(vi).

Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations, section 3.105(h) states, that except as otherwise specified at 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(3), where a reduction or discontinuance of benefits is warranted by reason of information received concerning income, net worth, dependency, or marital or other status, a proposal for the reduction or discontinuance of benefits will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The beneficiary will be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons for the contemplated action and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that the benefits should be continued at their present level. Unless otherwise provided by 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i), if additional evidence is not received within that period, final adverse action will be taken, and the award will be reduced or discontinued effective as specified under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.500-3.503.

Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations, section 3.105(i)(1) states, that in the advance written notice concerning the proposed action under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(h), the beneficiary will be informed that he or she will have an opportunity for a predetermination hearing, provided that such a request for such a hearing is received by VA within 30 days from the date of the notice. If a timely request is received, VA will notify the beneficiary in writing of the time and place of the hearing at least 10 days in advance of the scheduled hearing date. If a predetermination hearing is timely requested, benefit payments shall be continued at the previously established level pending a final determination concerning the proposed action. Only once the predetermination procedures specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (h) have been completed will VA take final action. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i)(2).

1. Entitlement to nonservice-connected pension is granted.

A January 2024 rating decision granted entitlement to nonservice-connected pension benefits, effective August 18, 2022. See Rating Decision (January 2024). A January 2024 notification letter further detailed that, while the Veteran's nonservice-connected pension benefits were (1) granted, effective August 28, 2022, and (2) terminated, effective October 1, 2022. See Notification Letter (January 2024). On his January 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran expressed disagreement with the January 2024 decision, specifically referencing a January 11, 2024" decision, which pertains to the date of the notification letter. See VA Form 10182 (June 2024). Thus, the Board has liberally construed his disagreement as to the termination of nonservice-connected pension benefits, effective October 1, 2022. See generally, Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198-200 (1992); EF v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 324, 326 (1991) (noting that VA must liberally construe all documents filed by a claimant to determine, or even to infer, what claims have been filed).

The Board concludes that the termination of nonservice-connected pension benefits from October 1, 2022, was improper and that restoration of the benefit is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.105(h).

The Board finds that the AOJ did not fulfill its due process obligations prior to termination of nonservice-connected pension benefits from October 1, 2022. VA's due process obligations are set out at 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i)(1) (requires the advance written notice of a proposed action under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(h); an opportunity for a predetermination hearing). Here, the record does not reflect that the AOJ provided notice of a proposed termination of the benefit prior to termination of the benefit. 

By way of history, the AOJ received the Veteran's initial claim for nonservice-connected pension benefits on August 18, 2022. See VA 21-527EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Pension) (August 2022). In November 2022, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA 21-686c Application Request To Add And/Or Remove Dependents, showing that he got married in September 2022. A January 2024 rating decision granted entitlement to nonservice-connected pension benefits from August 18, 2022, until October 1, 2022. The Veteran's nonservice-connected pension benefits were terminated, effective October 1, 2022, based on his total household income, which at that point also included his spouse. See Notification Letter (January 2024). 

This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with the January 2024 VA decision, which the Board has construed, per above, as a disagreement with the adverse action announced via the January 2024 VA notification letter. 

As noted above, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(h), the appellant is entitled to receive a proposal for the discontinuance setting forth all material facts and reasons. The beneficiary will be notified at his latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefor, and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that the benefits should be continued at their present level and, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i), an option to request a hearing within 30 days of the proposed termination before his benefits are terminated.

In this case, the record does not reflect that the AOJ provided notice of a proposed termination of nonservice-connected pension benefits from October 1, 2022, prior to the January 2024 decision terminating the benefit. No letter notifying the Veteran of the due process requirements, setting forth the material facts and reasons for the termination, instructing the Veteran to submit within 60 days any additional evidence to show that pension benefits should not be terminated, and informing him of his option to request a predetermination hearing within 30 days if desired has been provided.

The Board finds the exceptions under 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(3) are not applicable in the case, as the facts pertaining to income and unreimbursed medical expenses are not solely factual and unambiguous.

As the record contains no proposal for discontinuance of nonservice-connected pension benefits, the Board finds that the AOJ did not meet the procedural requirement of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(h) and (i), which entitle the appellant to a proposal letter, including the opportunity for a personal hearing be provided if requested within 30 days from the date of notification of proposed termination.

In sum, as VA's action to terminate nonservice-connected pension benefits did not comply with the procedural due process requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(h) and (i), the termination of the nonservice-connected pension benefits is void ab initio. Wilson v. West, 11 Vet. App. 383, 385-86 (1998).

Accordingly, to this extent only, the claim is granted, subject to the AOJ's proper development, to include, but not limited to, the Veteran's countable income and unreimbursed medical expenses.
