DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The reduction to a noncompensable rating for right hip strain was not proper, restoration of the 10 percent rating is granted.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip strain is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right fibula fracture (high ankle fracture) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right hip strain disability continued to meet the criteria for a 10 percent rating and the reduction was improper.  

2. The Veteran has been assigned the maximum rating available for limitation of extension of the right hip. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The reduction to a noncompensable rating for right hip strain was not proper, the criteria for restoration of the 10 percent rating have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344; Diagnostic Code (DC) 5251.

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip strain have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.59, 4.71a, DCs 5251, 5252, 5253.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1994 to October 2002, from September 2010 to January 2011, and from April 2011 to February 2022.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from June 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

On his February 2024 VA Form 10182 (notice of disagreement) the Veteran indicated that he wished to appeal a denial of service connection for back pain.  The Board notes that there was no rating decision issued in the year prior to the Veteran's February 2024 VA Form 10182 denying a claim for service connection for a back condition.  Accordingly, there is no issue of entitlement to service connection for a back condition currently in appellate status before the Board. 

In May 2023 the RO wrote to the Veteran informing him that if he wished to claim service connection for a back disorder he could fill out a VA Form 20-0955, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.  The Veteran did not respond. 

The Board notes that the record indicates that the Veteran does not use medication for treatment of his right hip strain disability.  In June 2023 a VA examiner noted that the Veteran reported that he did not take medication for his hip strain.  Accordingly, the ameliorating effects of medication do not apply for rating this Veteran's right hip strain disability.  Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798 (Vet.App. 2025).  

1. Whether reduction of the Veteran's 10 percent rating for right hip strain was proper.

Service connection was granted for the Veteran's right hip disability in an April 2022 rating decision.  An initial evaluation of 10 percent was assigned under DC 5251, effective March 1, 2022.    

The June 2023 rating decision on appeal reduced the Veteran's right hip rating under DC 5251 from 10 percent to noncompensable, effective May 30, 2023.  As the overall combined rating did not change, the RO did not propose the reduction before enacting it.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.  The Board will now consider the propriety of the rating reduction.

With respect to disability ratings in effect for less than five years, reexaminations disclosing improvement in disabilities will warrant a rating reduction.  38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).  Specifically, in such cases it is necessary to ascertain, based upon a review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in disability and whether examination reports reflecting change are based upon thorough examinations.  In addition, it must be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred and that such improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  See Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 421 (1993).  Additionally, in determining whether a reduction was proper, the Board must focus upon evidence available to the RO at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of rating whether the condition had actually improved.  Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 281-282 (1992).  

When the RO reduced the rating in the June 2023 rating decision, effective May 30, 2023, the 10 percent rating had been continuously in effect since March 1, 2022, a period of less than five years.  

The Veteran's 10 percent rating for his right hip strain was assigned under DC 5251 based on an April 2022 VA examination that showed extension of the right hip reduced to 20 degrees with repeated use over time and showed pain on extension of the right hip.  Although the June 2023 examination showed improvement in range of extension to 25 degrees with repeated use over time, the examination still showed less than full range of extension and still showed the Veteran to experience pain on extension of the right hip.  As the Veteran still had limitation of motion of the right hip and still experienced pain on motion of the right hip he still met the criteria for a 10 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  The intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or particular pathology as productive of disability.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011) (holding that section 4.59 applies to all forms of painful motion of joints, and not just to arthritis).   

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that there was not an actual improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Accordingly, the requirements for reduction of the rating for the right hip disability are not met and, as a result, the weight of the evidence does not support the reduction.  Consequently, the reduction from 10 percent to noncompensable for the Veteran's right hip strain was not proper.  The 10 percent rating is therefore restored, effective May 30, 2023.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip strain.

The Board must also consider whether the Veteran is entitled to a rating in excess of 10 percent for his right hip strain disability or a separate compensable rating under any other applicable diagnostic code for his right hip strain disability.  

With respect to a rating in excess of 10 percent for limitation of extension, the current 10 percent rating is the maximum schedular evaluation allowed under DC 5251.  Thus, a higher rating under DC 5251 is not available.

He is also not entitled to a separate compensable rating under any other applicable diagnostic code for his right hip strain disability.  The June 2023 VA examination report showed that the Veteran had full range of motion of the right hip, except with repeated use over time.  With repeated use over time that the Veteran had limitation of flexion to 100 degrees, limitation of abduction to 30 degrees, limitation of adduction to 20 degrees, external rotation limited to 50 degrees and internal rotation limited to 40 degrees.  None of these reductions in range of motion meet the criteria for a compensable rating under DC 5252 (flexion limited to 45 degrees or less) or DC 5253 (rotation limited to 15 degrees or abduction limited to 10 degrees).  The VA examinations also noted that the Veteran was not prevented from crossing his legs, which is another criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 5253.

To the extent the Veteran was shown by the June 2023 examination to have painful flexion and abduction of the right hip, the Veteran is already in receipt of a 10 percent rating based on painful motion (for limitation of extension), and thus is not entitled to additional compensable ratings based only on painful motion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59 does not permit separate compensable evaluations for each joint movement that results in painful motion; rather, it provides that painful motion is entitled to at least the minimum compensable evaluation for the joint.

Accordingly, the Veteran is not entitled to a rating in excess of 10 percent and is not entitled to a separate compensable rating under any other applicable diagnostic code for his right hip strain disability.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right fibula fracture.

The Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 10 percent for his service-connected right ankle disorder.  The RO assigned the 10 percent rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.  This diagnostic code provides ratings based on limitation of motion of the ankle.  Diagnostic Code 5271 does not explicitly contemplate medication use.  In this case VA examinations of the Veteran's right ankle performed in May 2023 and September 2023 note that the Veteran used medications to treat his right ankle disability.  However, the May and September 2023 examiners did not discuss whether the Veteran's right ankle range of motion improved with medication use (and, if so, to what extent) or whether flare-up frequency lessened with medication (and, if so, to what extent).  

On March 12, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) issued a precedential decision in Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798 (Vet.App. 2025).  This decision notes that Diagnostic Code 5271 does not contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication and that the Board must discount beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity of a disability when evaluating such disability.  As the VA examinations performed in in May and September 2023 did not include evaluation of the Veteran's right ankle disability discounting the effects of ameliorative medication, those examinations are insufficient for evaluating the Veteran's right ankle claim.  Accordingly, the Veteran's right ankle claim must be remanded for medical opinions that discuss the right ankle symptoms while discounting the effects of ameliorative medication.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Provide the Veteran a VA examination of the right ankle by an appropriate clinician.  The examiner should review the record and describe the Veteran's overall functional loss in the right ankle since February 2023.  The examiner must describe any functional limitation due to pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, pain with use, or incoordination.  The examiner must consider relevant information in the record regarding the severity, frequency, and duration of any flare-ups, and the degree of any functional loss during flare-ups and/or with repeated use over time.  Any estimated additional functional impairment of the right ankle during a flare-up or with repeated use over time must be expressed in terms of the degree of additional loss of range of motion.

Considering the May and September 2023 VA examinations, the examiner is to provide estimates as to what the Veteran's right ankle range of motion would have been, including during flare-ups and/or with repeated use over time if he had not been taking medication to treat his right ankle.  

A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  If it is not possible to provide retrospective estimated right ankle ranges of motion without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
