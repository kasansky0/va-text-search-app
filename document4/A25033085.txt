DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The certification of the instant appeal for entitlement to service connection for hypertension, under Docket Number 240315-424488, was erroneous.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for service connection for hypertension, under Docket Number 240315-424488, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1987 to August 1994, November 2005 to March 2006, April 2007 to December 2007, August 2008 to September 2008, August 2011 to November 2011, January 2013 to April 2013, May 2014 to February 2015, and from June 2015 to November 2015.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office that found new and relevant evidence since the prior March 2023 rating decision was submitted to readjudicate the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection but again denied the claim.

In March 2023, the Veteran timely appealed the December 2023 rating decision with submission of VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  Although the Veteran also identified both the March 2023 and December rating decisions on the VA Form 10182, the December 2023 rating decision affords the Veteran the maximum evidentiary period for his appeal.  

On the March 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

Now the matter is before the Board.

Here, the evidentiary record shows the Veteran submitted duplicate appeals for entitlement to service connection for hypertension to the Board in March 2023 and cited the March 2023 and December 2023 rating decisions as the adjudicative actions on appeal.  The issue was certified to the Board under the Docket Number listed on this decision and Docket Number 240315-423996, which resulted in two concurrent appeals for the same issue.

The Court has emphasized VA's prohibition against concurrent election, holding that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option."  Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 25-26 (2023).  The Court's holding in Terry was expressly predicated on finding that multiple review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(2)(A).  Id. at 3.  Accordingly, as in this case, a Veteran may not concurrently request appeal of the same issue.

As concurrent appeals are prohibited, the Board finds the certification of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for hypertension under the instant appeal stream, Docket Number 240315-424488, was erroneous.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. In addition, the Board notes that in March 2025, entitlement to service connection for hypertension was granted on a direct basis under the previously established Docket Number 240315-423996, which represents a total grant of the benefits sought on appeal.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d. 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  If the Veteran wishes to pursue a higher rating or earlier effective date for service connection, he should seek further review before the agency of original jurisdiction.  Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c). 

The Board may dismiss any case over which it determines it does not have the ability to review the appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (a).  When the Board cannot dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction in certain instances, it can still consider dismissing the appeal for other non-jurisdictional reasons such as a procedural defect.  See generally Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).  As the appeal for the issues seeking entitlement to service connection for hypertension was docketed following an impermissible concurrent appeal, these issues must be dismissed due to the procedural defect.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).
