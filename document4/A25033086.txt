ORDER

Service connection for anemia is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had an anemia disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for anemia are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1999 to June 2005 and from June 2005 to November 2005.  The period of active service from January 1999 to June 2005 is honorable for VA purposes.  See March 2019 Administrative Decision.  The period of active service from June 2005 to November 2005 is under dishonorable conditions.  Id.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran submitted evidence after the AOJ decision on appeal, which the Board did not consider.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with these claims in February 2024.  That examination is adequate with regard to the claim for service connection for anemia because it was based upon consideration of the Veteran's pertinent medical history as well as lay assertions and current complaints, and because it describes her diagnostic information in detail sufficient to allow the Board to make fully informed determinations.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (citing Ardison v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 405, 407 (1994)).

Neither the Veteran nor her representative have raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Service connection for anemia is denied.

The Veteran asserts that she experiences anemia as the result of sexual assault, hemorrhoids, gastrointestinal problems, and malnutrition.  See January 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ (Fully Developed Claim).  The Veteran further asserts she experiences anemia as a result of uterine fibroids.  See February 2024 VA examination.  The Veteran's spouse asserts that she experienced uterine problems causing severe anemia.  See January 2024 Statement.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1110.  Thus, the threshold question that must be addressed here (as with any claim seeking service connection) is whether the Veteran had the disability for which service connection is sought at any time during the period on appeal.  In the absence of proof of a disability during that period, there is no valid claim of service connection.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); see also Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997).

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of anemia and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran claimed service connection for anemia in VA Forms 21-526EZ (Fully Developed Claim) submitted in November 2023 and January 2024. 

The February 2024 VA examiner determined that, while the Veteran previously had anemia and takes ferrous gluconate and vitamin C supplements, the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of anemia and had no symptoms of anemia.  

While VA treatment records from October 2019 document iron deficiency anemia from blood loss related to uterine fibroids and a blood thinner, the anemia was later shown to be resolved.  While anemia is on a November 2023 active problem list from an outside provider included with VA treatment records, there are no accompanying complaints or treatment.  VA treatment records from December 2019, January 2020, and July 2020 show the source of the Veteran's anemia was addressed and her anemia was replete, meaning her iron levels had been restored.  VA treatment records from January 2021, February 2022, and July 2023 demonstrate the Veteran's hemoglobin was within the reference range.  March 2022 VA treatment records reveal the Veteran's hemoglobin was within normal limits. 

While the Veteran, her husband, and her representative believe there is a current diagnosis of anemia, they are not shown to be competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education and the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

Therefore, the evidence of record persuasively demonstrates that the Veteran does not have a current anemia disability, and the claim must be denied.
