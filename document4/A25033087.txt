ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 27, 2020, for the grant of service connection for fibromyalgia is denied.

The appeal seeking revision or reversal of the February 2019 rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A claim for service connection for fibromyalgia was denied in a February 2019 rating decision and the Veteran did not submit an appeal, supplemental claim, or request higher-level review within one year.

2. The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for fibromyalgia on August 27, 2020.

3. The correct facts, as known at the time, were before the VA adjudicators in February 2019 and the statutory and regulatory provisions extant at the time were correctly applied.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The February 2019 rating decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2500, 3.2501, 20.200, 20.1103.

2. An effective date prior to August 27, 2020, for the award of entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to revision of a February 2019 rating decision on the basis of CUE pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 have not been satisfied. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Navy from September 1990 to May 1994.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In January 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 2021 decision. Thereafter, in June 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the decision on appeal and characterized the review of the file as a "special review". The AOJ considered evidence in the file through June 2022.

In the January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.

Additionally, new evidence has not been considered in this decision regarding the claim for revision of the February 2019, rating decision based on CUE, because CUE decisions must be based upon the facts and law that existed at the time of the prior decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301; but see 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a)(1)(iii).

The Veteran was awarded service connection for fibromyalgia and assigned an initial rating of 40 percent, effective August 27, 2020, in an August 2021 rating decision. In January 2022, the Veteran sought an earlier effective date with the submission of a higher-level review request. The claim was denied in the June 2022 HLR decision on appeal. Although the Veteran has contended that there was CUE August 2021 rating decision that assigned the effective date of the Veteran's disability, the Board finds that the proper issue on appeal is entitlement to an effective date prior to August 27, 2020, for the award of service connection for fibromyalgia. See generally Young v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 51 (2019) (citing Gomez v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 39, 43 n.1 (2015) (observing that it would be "illogical" for a claimant to "forfeit the right to direct review of a [VA] decision in exchange for review under the much higher scrutiny of a CUE motion").

Lastly, in the VA Form 10182 the Veteran characterized his appeal as regarding:

Entitlement to and earlier effective date of 9/21/2018 (Date of Claim) for service connection for Fibromyalgia is not shown due to a clear and unmistakable error. The 40 percent evaluation is continued from August 17, 2020.

A statement submitted with his VA Form 10182 makes clear that the Veteran is solely seeking an earlier effective date, which is considered below.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 27, 2020, for the grant of service connection for fibromyalgia.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for fibromyalgia.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has determined that, even when a Veteran has a claim to reopen, "he cannot obtain an effective date earlier than the reopened claim's application date." Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir., 2005) (indicating that "no matter how [the Veteran] tries to define 'effective date,' the simple fact is that, absent a showing of CUE, he cannot receive disability payments for a time frame earlier than the application date of his claim to reopen, even with new evidence supporting an earlier disability date").

The Board finds that entitlement to an effective date prior to August 27, 2020, for the grant of service connection for fibromyalgia is not warranted. 

In a February 25, 2019, rating decision the Veteran was denied entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia. AMA automatically applies to all claims with regard to which an AOJ issued an initial decision on or after the effective date of AMA, i.e., February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2.

In general, AOJ decisions that are not timely appealed are final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.200 20.1103. However, under the AMA, VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence (NRE) is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d). As a general matter, NRE must be presented or secured with respect to a supplemental claim to warrant readjudication of the claim; this holds true regardless of whether the most recent prior decision on the issue is final or whether the supplemental claim is received within one year of the most recent prior decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. "New evidence" is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators; "relevant evidence" is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue (including evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed). 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1). Notably, the new and relevant standard is lower than the new and material standard under the legacy (pre-AMA) system. 

Herein, the Veteran did not submit a timely appeal of this decision to the Board or request reconsideration with a Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review. In addition, although new VA treatment records were associated with the claims file within a year following the rating decision and these records identify notations of rule out fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia, these records are cumulative of the notations prior to the February 2019 rating decision. Therefore, the decision became final.

Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a claim for fibromyalgia received on August 27, 2020, more than one year after the February 2019 decision denying the Veteran's claim. In August 2021, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia, effective August 27, 2020, the date of the current claim for benefits.

The Board finds that entitlement to an effective date prior to August 27, 2020, for the grant of service connection for fibromyalgia is not warranted. As discussed above, the Veteran was denied entitlement to service connection in a February 2019 rating decision and the decision became final. The Board finds that the Veteran did not continuously pursue the claim as he did not submit an appeal to the Board or submit a supplemental claim or higher-level review request. Thereafter, the Veteran next sought entitlement to service connection in an August 27, 2020, claim and was granted entitlement to service connection from that date. Therefore, the Veteran is already in receipt of the earliest effective date available, and the claim is denied. 

2. Entitlement to revision or reversal of the February 2019 rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia on the basis of CUE.

The Veteran asserts that there is CUE in the February 2019 rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia. Specifically, the Veteran contends that the VA committed a duty to assist error in not obtaining and considering all available VA medical records in the February 2019 rating decision. 

A previous RO determination that is final and binding will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE.  Where evidence establishes such error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). As discussed in detail above, the February 2019 rating decision became final because the Veteran did not timely appeal the decision, or submit a supplemental claim or higher-level review within one year of the decision. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2500, 3.2501, 20.200.

Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105. CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error."  It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE. Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error." Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993). In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different. Id. at 44. 

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision. Id. 

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered. Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992). 

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision. See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999). A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset. King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014). The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different. Id. at 442. 

The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application in claims of CUE. Andrews v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 177, 186 (2004) (citing Russell, 3 Vet. App. at 313) (it is well established that the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine can never be applicable in assessing a CUE motion because the nature of such a motion is that it involves more than a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated). 

As a threshold matter, the Board finds that the arguments advanced by the Veteran allege CUE with the requisite specificity. See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003). The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of his claims. 

The Board finds that entitlement to revision based upon CUE is not warranted. The Veteran's argument is essentially a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated by the adjudicator. He asserts that the record shows that he was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and that the consideration of a VA examiner's opinion in February 2019 was not sufficient. However, "[i]t is the prerogative of the factfinder . . . to interpret the evidence and draw reasonable inferences from it." Evans, 27 Vet. App. at 187 (citing Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 52 (1990)). A disagreement as to how the facts were weighed does not support a finding of CUE. Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 43-44. 

In addition, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contentions that the RO failed to obtain complete VA treatment records or otherwise failed to fully discharge the duty to assist. Nevertheless, a breach of the duty to assist cannot constitute CUE. Cook v. Principi, 318 F.3d 1334, 1345-47 (Fed. Cir. 2002); see also Caffrey v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?377, 384 (1994). As noted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in Cook, the requirements that a clear and unmistakable error be both outcome determinative and based on the record that existed at the time of the original decision make it impossible for a breach of the duty to assist to form the basis for a CUE claim. Cook, 318 F.3d at 1346. Consequently, the Board finds that the February 2019 rating decision was not clearly and unmistakably erroneous and no revision is warranted.
