ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus began during service and has continued to the present.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1993 to March 1999.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2024 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that denied service connection claims to include one for tinnitus.  

The Veteran requested higher level review in June 2024, and the AOJ issued a responsive rating decision in September 2024.  The Veteran submitted VA Form 10182 in October 2024, electing the direct Board review option.  The Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 rating decision.

The Board observes that in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that in cases decided pursuant to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has elapsed.  Here, the Board has determined that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  Given that this constitutes a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with adjudication.

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus.  She maintains that she had symptoms during service after she was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  See March 2024 VA examination report.  The Board observes that service treatment records document treatment in September 1994 after the Veteran was injured during a motor vehicle accident, and that she reported that she was a front seat passenger and struck her head.  

Entitlement to VA compensation may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active duty.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 (wartime service), 1131 (peacetime service); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"-the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The Board observes that in Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374-375 (2002), the Court specifically held that tinnitus is a condition which is capable of lay observation.  Service treatment records reflect that the Veteran sustained a head injury during service, and the record also contains her credible report of tinnitus since that time.  Because tinnitus is a condition capable of lay observation, and because the Veteran has credibly reported that her in-service symptoms continued following service, service connection for tinnitus is granted.
