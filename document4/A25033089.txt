REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from July 1967 to September 1969. 

By way of background, in March 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision, in which they found a duty to assist error with regards to the Veteran's service connection claims for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. The same day, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim for the same issues.

In a November 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy and assigned the following ratings with an effective date of December 10, 2022: 40 percent (right upper extremity), 30 percent (left upper extremity), noncompensable (bilateral lower extremity). 

A December 2023 rating decision increased the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy ratings to 20 percent effective December 11, 2023, and continued the Veteran's bilateral upper extremity peripheral neuropathy ratings.

The Veteran timely appealed the November 2023 rating decision to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182, wherein he selected the evidence review docket within the Veterans Appeals Improvement Modernization Act (AMA) review system. He also requested earlier effective dates for all claims, as well as special monthly compensation (SMC).

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 10182, appealing the December 2023 rating decision, and again requested earlier effective dates for all claims and SMC. 

In February 2025, the Board granted an earlier effective date of February 2, 2012 for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy and remanded his increased rating claims for readjudication in connection with the earlier effective dates, as well as SMC prior to August 10, 2022.  As such, the Board finds that as the Veteran has already been granted an earlier effective date for his claims, and his increased rating claims will be readjudicated for the entire period on appeal, this appeal stream has been rendered moot. In other words, it would be duplicative to adjudicate the Veteran's claims here, when the Veteran has already been granted an earlier effective date, and the AOJ will be reviewing additional evidence on remand to assess his assigned ratings (to include an earlier effective date for SMC). 

Should the Veteran disagree with the new ratings that are assigned, he may file a notice of disagreement. 

As such, the Veteran's claims for increased ratings for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, and earlier effective dates, including SMC, are dismissed.
