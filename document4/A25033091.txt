ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for scar of the forehead is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's scar of the forehead has been painful for the entire period on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for scar of the forehead have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.655(b), 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7804.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1993 to November 1997.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim on appeal, most recently addressed in a June 2023 rating decision. In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to a disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for scar of the forehead is granted.

The Board notes that the Veteran's service-connected scar of the forehead has been assigned a noncompensable rating for the entire period on appeal under DC 7800 for scars of the head, face, or neck. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. This appeal dates back to the Veteran's original claim for an increased rating, filed on December 10, 2022.

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when assigning disability ratings. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that may result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). The following analysis is undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different ratings may be warranted for different time periods.

The rating of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. That does not preclude the assignment of separate ratings for separate and distinct symptomatology where none of the symptomatology justifying a rating under one diagnostic code is duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology justifying a rating under another diagnostic code. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994).

The Board again notes that the Veteran's scar of the forehead is currently rated under DC 7800. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under DC 7800, one characteristic of disfigurement warrants a 10 percent rating. A scar with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with two or three characteristics of disfigurement warrants a 30 percent rating. A scar with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with four or five characteristics of disfigurement warrants a 50 percent rating. A scar with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion of three or more features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with six or more characteristics of disfigurement warrants an 80 percent rating.

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that the evidence of record does not indicate that the Veteran's service-connected scar of the forehead has any characteristic of disfigurement, which would be a requirement for a minimum compensable rating of 10 percent under DC 7800. Further, the Veteran has not argued that such disfigurement exists. Instead, the Veteran has argued that he is entitled to a 10 percent disability rating for painful scars under DC 7804. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118; see also July 2024 VA Form 10182, p. 4. The Board notes that scars evaluated under DC 7800, such as the Veteran's scar of the forehead, may receive an evaluation under DC 7804, when applicable. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804, n.3. Therefore, the Board will address whether the Veteran is entitled to a compensable disability for the scar under DC 7804.

DC 7804 provides disability ratings for scars that are unstable or painful. A 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful. A 20 percent rating is warranted for three or four scars that are unstable or painful. A 30 percent rating is warranted for five or more scars that are unstable or painful.

Turning to the evidence, the Board notes that in a February 2010 VA examination, the Veteran endorsed pain relating to his scar of the forehead. See February 2010 C&P Examination, p. 1. In his December 2022 increased rating claim, he stated that the scar is tender and that it causes headaches. See December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, p. 3. In December 2022, he also submitted a personal statement in which he stated, "I feel burning aching pain if anything touches the scar. Things like wearing hats aggravate the pain in my scar."

The Board notes that the Veteran also underwent a VA scars examination in March 2023 in which the examiner noted that the Veteran's scar of the head was not painful. See March 2023 C&P Examination, p. 5. However, the examiner did not address any of the prior statements in the claims file in which the Veteran endorsed pain of his forehead scar. Additionally, the examination does not indicate that the examiner discussed or elicited a history of the condition with the Veteran. The history section of the examination simply lists that he underwent a right knee arthroplasty and right ankle ORIF that were both well-healed. Id. at 2. It is unclear from the examination report the extent to which the examiner elicited any information regarding the history or symptomatology of the Veteran's forehead scar, if at all. Therefore, the Board assigns this examination minimal probative value as it relates to his service-connected scar of the forehead.

The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to describe symptoms and events observable to his senses. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 493 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The Board has no reason to discredit the Veteran's statements that his service-connected scar of the forehead is painful and the Board further notes that his statements regarding such pain have dated back to his February 2010 VA examination. His statements regarding pain of his forehead scar have been consistent since 2010, adding further probative value to his statements. Therefore, resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that his scar of the forehead has been painful for the entire period on appeal and the claim for an increased rating 10 percent for the disability is warranted. However, as the evidence does not indicate that there are at least three painful scars, a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted.
