DOCKET NO. 241205-498026
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to evaluation of intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, rated 40 percent prior to September 25, 2023, and 20 percent as of that date, is dismissed.

Entitlement to a total disability evaluation based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At the March 11, 2025, Board hearing, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested as to the issue of evaluation of IVDS and degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, rated 40 percent prior to September 25, 2023, and 20 percent as of that date.

2. The evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities in aggregate preclude him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met as to the issue of the evaluation of IVDS and degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, rated 40 percent prior to September 25, 2023, and 20 percent as of that date.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Unites States Army from July 1969 to February 1971, to include service in Vietnam.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in which the RO reduced the rating for IVDS from 40 to 20 percent effective September 25, 2023, and denied TDIU.  The rating decision arose from an August 2023 TDIU claim, VA form 21-8940.

In December 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework, electing the hearing docket by the Board.  

The Veteran was afforded a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in March 2025.  

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the notification of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  

At the Board hearing, the Veteran incorporated medical records received by VA on March 2025, referencing current back treatment to include recurring injections for pain, and records identified by the representative as the employment statement by his treating provider saying he cannot work due to his combination of pain.  

As the transcript of the proceeding reflects, during the March 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran waived the 90 day period during which he could submit additional evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.300(b).  

In addition, as the transcript of the proceeding shows, the Veteran testified that this appeal would be satisfied in full as to all issues by a grant of TDIU.  While a Veteran is presumed to be seeking the maximum possible benefit, he is free to limit the scope of her appeal. AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 39 (1993) (a claimant may limit an appeal to particular issues with expression of clear intent to do so).  He has thus limited the scope of his appeal with regard to these issues.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claims, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board also acknowledges that there have been multiple rating decisions since the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, to include a March 2025 rating decision increasing the rating for PTSD from 30 to 50 percent effective May 8, 2024.  

The Board notes that the Veteran's Privacy Act request has been fulfilled.  See March 2025 Privacy Act letters to Veteran and attorney-representative.  

1. Evaluation of IVDS and degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, rated 40 percent prior to September 25, 2023, and 20 percent as of that date, is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

Verbal withdrawal of a claim must be "explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action."  Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009, 1013-15 (Fed. Cir. 2018); DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011); see also Hansen v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 29, 32 (1996) (holding the veteran validly withdrew his claim when "there [was] no indication that the veteran was misguided or lacked understanding of the consequences of his actions").

During the March 2025 Board hearing for this appeal, the Veteran withdrew from appeal the issue of evaluation of IVDS and degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, rated 40 percent prior to September 25, 2023, and 20 percent as of that date.  The transcript documents the clarifying discussion between the Veteran, his attorney, and the undersigned, in which the Veteran and his attorney communicated that the issue was being withdrawn from the appeal, with the Veteran reporting this appeal will be fully satisfied with the grant of TDIU.  

The Board finds that the Veteran's withdrawal as to evaluation of IVDS and degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, rated 40 percent prior to September 25, 2023, and 20 percent as of that date, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action; the issue being withdrawn was clearly identified, he stated his intent to have the issue withdrawn and the appeal dismissed as to the issue, evaluation of IVDS and degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, rated 40 percent prior to September 25, 2023, and 20 percent as of that date.  There is no evidence that the Veteran was misguided or lacked understanding of the consequences of his actions.  

In light of the foregoing, there remains no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration with regard to the claim for evaluation of IVDS and degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, rated 40 percent prior to September 25, 2023, and 20 percent as of that date, and the issue must be dismissed as to this issue.  Acree.

2. TDIU is granted.

The Veteran testified that he is unable to work due to the combined effects of his service-connected disabilities during the period on appeal.  

The Veteran completed and submitted VA Forms 21-8940 (Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability) in August 2023 in which he reported that he was unable to work due, at least in part, to his IVDS and bilateral radiculopathy.  As noted, he has since testified that the combined effects of the other conditions and his psychiatric disability also contribute to making him unemployable.  

It is the established policy of the VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.  A total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. Entitlement to a TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16; Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85-86 (2014).  Thus, in adjudicating a TDIU claim, VA must take into account the individual veteran's education, training, and work history, but not his or her age or the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; see also Todd, 27 Vet. App. at 85-86.  

The ultimate question of whether a Veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is an adjudicatory determination, not a medical one.  See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more service-connected disabilities, provided that one of those disabilities is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disabilities to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

In determining whether a veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, attention must be given to:

The veteran's history, education, skill, and training;

Whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy) required by the occupation at issue.  Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, and reaching, as well as auditory and visual limitations; and

Whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue. Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the veteran's limitations, if any, concerning memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity.

Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).

At the time of the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, service connection was in effect for IVDS, rated 20 percent from October 5, 2022, 40 percent from March 13, 2023, and 20 percent from September 25, 2023; bilateral lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy associated with IVDS, each rated 10 percent disabling from October 5, 2022, and 20 percent from March 13, 2023; bilateral lower extremity femoral radiculopathy associated with IVDS, each rated 20 percent from March 13, 2023; nephropathy, rated 30 percent from October 5, 2022; PTSD, rated 30 percent from June 16, 2023; tinnitus, rated 10 percent from October 5, 2022; hypertension rated noncompensable from August 10, 2022, and bilateral hearing loss, rated noncompensable from October 5, 2022.  

The combined ratings at the time of the rating decision on appeal were noncompensable from August 8, 2022; 60 percent from October 5, 2022, and 90 percent from March 13, 2023.  

The Board finds that the 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a) criteria are met as of the date of claim in August 2023, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a) (3) for disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g. orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric.

The Veteran testified that due to his physical limitations of his back and legs he uses cane to stop from falling.  

As to PTSD, he has significant issues with memory, focus and concentration.  

With respect to his renal condition and hypertension, he reported that they are productive of urinary issues, and he has urinary frequency.  He receives steroid injections for his back, and the non-VA medical records he submitted reflect that he is actively receiving ongoing injections to deal with the pain and complications of the back and leg problems.  He also reported that VA gave him a buzzing device in his shoe with a strap that goes around his ankle which "buzzes" on the back, front or side of leg if he is at risk of tripping.  Before getting this device, he used to trip and fall often.  He reported he was unable to walk more than 15 minutes at a time.  He also noted swelling in his legs due to his kidneys.  He cannot do prolonged sitting or standing.  For example, when he sits in church service, he squirms because it is more than an hour.  He has no ability to squat now due to the back and leg issues.  

The Veteran indicated that his employment required physical labor.  As a machinist, his back problem impacted his work because machinists have to stand and move to get tools.  He also worked as a welder which was physical work.  Then as a supervisor he was required to do a lot of standing and walking.  He reported he retired on disability while working as a supervisor because he could not do it anymore.  

As to his PTSD, he also testified he has trouble focusing and concentrating because he has flashbacks and has trouble falling and staying asleep.  It causes him to have a temper and dislike crowds.  The smell of rice reminds him of Vietnam.  As for his hypertension, he sometimes feels dizzy.  He has fatigue during day, takes naps, and would need an accommodation for naps.

The record contains some conflicting evidence that must be addressed.  First, as to education, the Veteran clarified at the hearing that he had a high school education with some vocational training.  He worked as a machinist and took a correspondence course for electrician.  He last worked in 2015.  Here the Board notes that the medical records submitted by the Veteran from his private medical provider showing treatment in November 2024 reflect his status as employed.  Nonetheless, the Veteran clarified through his testimony that he last worked prior to the August 2023 VA form 21-8940 was filed.  

Consistent with his testimony, VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran has repeatedly been noted to have substantial functional problems related to his multiple service-connected disabilities.  

The Board notes a December 2023 statement from the Veteran's non-VA treating provider that he is being treated for neuropathy, restless leg and lumbar pain.  Given these diagnoses, it is the provider's opinion that the Veteran cannot work, and standing or sitting for prolonged periods is not recommended.  

Here, the critical facts are not in dispute and have been set forth above.  He has documented how his service-connected physical and mental health conditions collectively limit his ability to perform sustained work-related tasks.  The Board notes that at the hearing, he candidly testified about the occupational impact of his physical and mental health issues.  

Given the evidence of the severity of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, the Veteran's functional limitations due to his service-connected disabilities, in light of his individual work experience and education, and with the resolution of all reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that the evidence shows he is entitled to an award of a TDIU based on the August 2023 claim, due to his service-connected disabilities.  See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2013).
