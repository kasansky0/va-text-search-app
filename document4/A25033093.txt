ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with anxiety, depression and dysthymic is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

As the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted the Veteran's claim in a recent November 2024 rating decision, there is no claim or controversy before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), and the claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with anxiety, depression and dysthymic, is moot.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as PTSD with anxiety, depression and dysthymic have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from September 2009 to December 2010.

This matter comes to the Board on appeal from a July 2024 higher-level review decision, following a May 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the AOJ. 

In July 2024 the Veteran filed his VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, electing the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider evidence that was before the AOJ at the time of the May 2024 rating decision. Any evidence submitted outside the permitted window cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider the additional evidence that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and identify the evidence for the AOJ's consideration. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

As a procedural matter, the Board finds that the AOJ has determined that new and relevant evidence has been received and has reopened a claim that was previously denied in November 2018. The Board will not disturb this favorable finding.

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with anxiety, depression and dysthymic

The present claim comes before the Board from an August 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, wherein the Veteran was seeking service connection for his acquired psychiatric disability. While the Veteran specifically cited PTSD, anxiety, and depression as his conditions, the claim has been expanded to encompass all related psychiatric disorders. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). This claim was eventually denied by the AOJ in July 2024, and he then appealed it to the Board that same month. 

At the same time, in July 2024, the Veteran filed another VA Form 21-526EZ seeking service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. This was a separate appeal stream from the one current appealed to the Board, though it encompassed the same claim and same facts. 

In November 2024 the AOJ granted the Veteran's claims effective August 2022, the date that the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder was reopened by the AOJ. See November 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative. 

This November 2024 grant is considered a full grant of benefits sought by the Veteran, namely service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, and it has been assigned the earliest effective date allowed by law (the date of claim). 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

As such, there is no current claim or controversy before the Board stemming from the July 2024 VA Form 10182 filed by the Veteran, and the appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.
