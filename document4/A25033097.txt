ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, his hypertension requires the continuous use of medication and has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, but his hypertension is not productive of diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for hypertension have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1973 to June 1975, with service in the territorial waters of Guam during the Vietnam War.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  In cases where the original rating assigned is appealed, consideration must be given to whether a higher rating is warranted at any point during the pendency of the claim.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  The analysis in the following decision is therefore undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different ratings may be warranted for different time periods.

If the evidence for and against a claim is approximately balanced, the claim will be granted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  A claim will be denied only if the record persuasively weighs against the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension.

The Veteran seeks an increased rating for hypertension.

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more.  A 60 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

VA treatment records prior to the period on appeal reflect the Veteran was prescribed Benazepril for his hypertension in June 2008.  VA treatment records thereafter reflect several changes in the Veteran's medication.  In March 2009, his blood pressure was 160/100. In December 2010, his blood pressure was 180/100. A February 2011 treatment record reveals a blood pressure reading of 160/110; however, the Veteran reported that his blood pressure is usually well controlled.  A July 2011 treatment record reveals a blood pressure reading of 181/114.  Since then, the Veteran's blood pressure readings have fluctuated, but none have measured diastolic pressure of 110 or more or systolic pressure of 200 or more.  A February 2021 treatment record reveals the Veteran's blood pressure is within normal limits and he is to continue taking his blood pressure medication; his blood pressure reading that day was 138/88.  A June 2021 treatment record reveals the Veteran reported his blood pressure averages 140/80.  A September 2022 treatment record reveals the Veteran is prescribed three medications for hypertension: Amlodipine, Hydrochlorothiazide, and Losartan.

Private treatment records since the Veteran was prescribed blood pressure medication in June 2008 reflect blood pressure controlled by medication.

The Veteran attended a VA examination in January 2023.  He reported hypertension that began in the 1980's.  His disability has remained the same since onset and he currently takes three medications to control his blood pressure: Amlodipine, Hydrochlorothiazide, and Losartan.  Blood pressure readings during the examination were 136/78, 121/70, and 113/89.  There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to hypertension.  It was unknown whether his initial diagnosis was confirmed by blood pressure readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.  The examiner diagnosed hypertension.

The Board finds that an initial rating of 10 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's hypertension.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and controlled by medication.  The evidence is at least in equipoise of such finding.  VA treatment records prior to the period on appeal reveal several instances of blood pressure readings where the Veteran's diastolic pressure exceeded 100.  Multiple physicians have adjusted his medications to control his hypertension, to include prescribing additional medications when warranted.  Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board thus finds that he meets the criteria for a 10 percent rating.

A higher 20 percent rating is not warranted unless diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more.  The numerous readings during the rating period reflect that the Veteran's blood pressure was consistently below 110 diastolic and below 200 systolic.  As such, it cannot be said that the Veteran's diastolic pressure was most commonly above 110 or that his systolic pressure was most commonly above 200 during the period on appeal.  Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  Accordingly, his hypertension does not warrant a 20 percent rating at any time during the appeal period.
