REMANDED

Service connection for hypertension is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1968 to June 1970 with subsequent service in the Naval Reserve.

In August 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (Appeals Modernization Act or AMA), Pub. Law 115-55, which created a new claims and appeals process for pursuing VA benefits. All initial rating decisions issued after February 19, 2019, are promulgated under the AMA. The rating decision preceding this appeal is a Higher-Level Review (HLR) opinion issued in December 2022 following an October 2022 HLR Request in response to an October 2021 rating decision (the rating decision on appeal). Thus, the October 2021 rating decision is an initial decision, and the AMA applies. 

In his timely May 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. Although the Veteran elected the hearing docket and notice of the hearing was provided to the Appellant, she did not attend the hearing scheduled for August 5, 2024, nor did she submit evidence within 90 days of the hearing date. See May 2024 Board Hearing Letter; December 2024 Board Notification Letter.

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023). However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider with respect to that issue will be considered by the AOJ on remand. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Preliminary Matters

On June 9, 2023, VA was notified that the Veteran had unfortunately passed away during the pendency of this appeal. On June 13, 2023, the Veteran's surviving spouse timely submitted a VA Form 21P-0847 "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant" as a person eligible to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim(s). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a). In July 2023, VA granted this request and substituted the Veteran's surviving spouse as the Appellant. 

The Board observes that this matter was previously remanded in October 2019 and January 2021 for further development, to include obtaining an additional medical examination and/or opinion. After conducting the development directed by the Board remand, the AOJ issued the October 2021 rating decision on appeal denying the claim, which the Veteran ultimately appealed to the Board following the December 2022 HLR decision.

Service Connection for Hypertension

The Appellant contends that the Veteran's hypertension resulted from his military service. 

After a review of the record, the Board regrettably determines that a remand is again necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 

VA's duty to assist includes providing an adequate medical examination and opinion. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). In this case, the Veteran was provided with a VA examination for hypertension in November 2019 and July 2021. While both examiners diagnosed the Veteran with hypertension, they did not find a causal link between this diagnosis and the Veteran's military service on a direct basis. The November 2019 and July 2021 medical opinions are inadequate for adjudicating the Veteran's claim, as they both impermissibly relied solely on a lack of medical evidence of hypertension contemporaneous to service in finding that a connection had not been established. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336, n. 1 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015); Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011). Thus, a remand for an adequate opinion is necessary.

Further, the Veteran has presented evidence of herbicide agent exposure by virtue of his potentially qualifying service during the Vietnam War and his exposure to toxins such as foam, solvents, fuel, and chemicals, due to his training as a firefighter. The evidence of record at the time the rating decision on appeal was issued confirms the Veteran served overseas for 19 months, including aboard the USS Betelgeuse, and that he completed basic firefighter training. See DD-214. 

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) provides that, if a veteran submits a claim for service connection with evidence of a disability and evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), then VA shall obtain a medical opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that there is a relationship between the disability and the TERA. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a). 

Due to this change in the law, a remand is also required for proper adjudication of the service connection claim for the Veteran's hypertension to afford the Veteran a TERA opinion regarding the cause(s) of that condition.

Although the Board regrets the additional delay, remand is once again warranted to obtain evidence that will allow the Board to come to a fair and accurate decision for the Veteran and the Appellant.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action(s):

1. The AOJ should arrange for a TERA opinion by an appropriate VA clinician pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a) to ascertain whether the Veteran's hypertension is directly related to his military service, including his presumed toxic exposure while serving. 

The claims file should be reviewed by the examiner, and the examiner is asked to respond to the following:

(a.) Was the Veteran's hypertension either incurred in or otherwise related to the Veteran's service, including as a result of his toxic exposure? Why or why not?

The clinician should address: (1) the total potential exposure through the Veteran's service and (2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities.
