ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, his tinnitus is etiologically related to his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1985 to December 1999 and from April 2005 to November 2006.

This matter was initially denied in a December 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In January 2024, the Veteran requested Higher level Review (HLR) of the December 2023 denial of service connection for tinnitus.  The AOJ again denied the Veteran's claim in a May 2024 rating decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 rating decision.

In September 2024 the Veteran timely submitted a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to the Board of Veterans' Appeal (Board) seeking appeal of the May 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran checked "direct review" by a Veterans Law Judge. Therefore, any evidence submitted after the December 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher level review, cannot be considered by the Board.? 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.?

The Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In this case, a docket switch is still permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) as it is less than one year from the date that the AOJ mailed notice of the decision on appeal, but it is more than 60 days of the date that the Board received the September 2024 NOD.  However, as the instant decision represents a full grant of the benefits sought, there is no prejudice to the Veteran for proceeding before the end of one year from rating decision on appeal, and the Board shall proceed with adjudication.

Service Connection

The law provides that service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.? 38 U.S.C. § 1110;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

To establish service connection for a claimed disorder, the following must be shown: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury;?and?(3) a causal relationship between the present disability?and?the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163, 1167?(Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree in a specified period of time post-service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. That period of time is usually one year. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(3). For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), an alternative method of establishing an in-service disease or injury and a nexus for chronic diseases is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). Continuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was "noted" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999) (lay evidence of in-service incurrence sufficient in some circumstances for purposes of establishing service connection); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran contends his bilateral tinnitus is etiologically related to his active service.  See November 2023 VA Form 21-526 EZ Fully Developed Claim (Veteran noted exposure to noises greater than 140 decibels daily from aircraft engine noise as well as noise exposure from small arms fire. see  December 2023 Hearing Loss Examination (Veteran reported that he was a helicopter pilot, exposure to small arms fire, and occasionally exposed to aircraft on the flightline); see also DD214 (showing MOS of Officer in Charge, Aviation Unit or Detachment, an Aircraft Organizational Maintenance Officer, and as a Squadron Operations Officer all of which have a high probability of noise exposure).  

The decision on appeal conceded both a current diagnosis of tinnitus and military noise exposure because of the Veteran's MOS of Pilot.  These are favorable findings which are binding on the Board.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Thus, the central issue that must be resolved at this time is whether the Veteran's current tinnitus originated during service or is otherwise related to service.

The Board determines that the probative evidence contained in the evidentiary window is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to his service.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) and the extensive hearing conservation data collected during his service.  The STRs show that the Veteran experienced a threshold shift in hearing from entry in 1985 to separation in 1999.  See June 1985 Auditory Measurements; see also October 1999 Separation Exam.  A significant threshold shift was noted in June 2004; however, this was not during a period of active-duty service.  The Board further notes the STRs show the Veteran checked "NO" for hearing loss or ringing in the ears on multiple "Abbreviated Aeromedical Examinations" through 2006. 

The Board has considered the December 2023 VA examination in which the examiner concluded that because 1) the denied tinnitus on his aeromedical exams on June 1999 and July 2001, 2) no evidence of significant shifts in hearing or high frequency hearing loss during service were found, and 3) the Veteran's description of his tinnitus is not consistent with the Tinnitus Handbook (Tyler) that the Veteran's tinnitus is less likely than not related to military noise exposure.  No other etiologies or intercurrent causes were provided and the Veteran's lay statements were not addressed. 

To the extent the VA examiner opined that it was less likely as not the Veteran's tinnitus was related to his military service, the Board finds this opinion to be of limited probative value as the opinion failed to account for the Veteran's conceded diagnosis and conceded acoustic trauma by way of his MOS. 

Here, the Board finds the totality of the evidence, both positive and negative, is at least in approximate balance.  The December 2023 examiner found that the Veteran's tinnitus did not begin in or is otherwise related to his service.  However, the Veteran has self-reported that he has experienced a "loud ringing" in his ears and while he has inconsistently reported the date of onset, he believes it was caused by noise exposure in service.  See November 2023 VA Form 21-526 EZ Fully Developed Claim (Veteran noted onset to be 6 years ago); see also December 2023 Hearing Loss Examination (Veteran reported onset to be early 2000s).  Tinnitus is consistent with the circumstances of his service as an Officer in Charge, Aviation Unit or Detachment, an Aircraft Organizational Maintenance Officer, and as a Squadron Operations Officer.  

Accordingly, and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The appeal is granted.
