ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) based solely upon the service-connected depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder is granted, effective for the entire appellate period, so from September 11, 2020.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted, effective for the entire appellate period, so from September 11, 2020.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire appellate period, so from September 11, 2020, the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's service-connected depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder prevented him from obtaining or maintaining substantially gainful employment.

2. For the entire appellate period, so from September 11, 2020, the Veteran has a TDIU based solely on his service-connected depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder, with additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a TDIU based solely on the service-connected depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder have been met from September 11, 2020.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.15, 4.16.

2. The criteria for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) have been met from September 11, 2020.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from December 1998 to December 1999.  

Procedurally, a January 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), in pertinent part, awarded entitlement to a TDIU, effective September 11, 2020.  See January 2023 Rating Decision (finding that the Veteran was "unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of [his service-connected] physical and mental disabilities," including specifically his "right knee status post meniscal tear - instability, depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder, right knee status post meniscal tear - dislocated semilunar cartilage, right knee status post meniscal tear - degenerative arthritis").

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, challenging the Agency of Original Jurisdiction's (AOJ's) failure to award a TDIU based solely upon the service-connected psychiatric pathology and the resultant implicit denial of entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) based on a service-connected disability rated as total and has additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 292-94 (2008) (analyzing 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) and clarifying that SMC at the (s) rate may be warranted if the Veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total, to include a finding of entitlement to a TDIU based solely on that disability, and has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more).  

In a decision issued later that month, a higher-level reviewer at the AOJ confirmed and continued the previous January 2023 decision, finding that a TDIU based solely upon the service-connected psychiatric disability was not warranted and emphasizing that it was the combination of the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric condition and his service-connected orthopedic conditions that precluded substantially gainful employment.  See July 2023 Rating Decision.  As such, because the Veteran did not have a single disability rated as total, the higher-level reviewer concluded that the AOJ's "decision not to address entitlement to [SMC at the (s) rate] was proper."  See id.  

The Veteran appealed this determination to the Board, maintaining that the AOJ erred in failing to award a TDIU based solely upon the service-connected psychiatric disorder, which, if granted, would entitle him to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) based on the service-connected psychiatric disability rated as total by virtue of the TDIU, and his additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more.  See July 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182).  As such, and considering that both the January 2023 rating decision and the July 2023 higher-level review decision explicitly addressed the Veteran's claim of entitlement to a TDIU based solely upon his service-connected psychiatric pathology, the Board has characterized the issues on appeal as reflected on the title page of this decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Under direct review, no development may be undertaken; the Board considers the same record as the RO in rendering a decision, and there is no evidence submission or a hearing request.  Accordingly, the evidentiary record is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the January 2023 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

TDIU

A TDIU may be assigned, if the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id.

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table).

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  Id.  The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment.  Id.  Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity).  Id.

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training.  See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014).  It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability.  Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  The ultimate question is whether they are capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

1. Entitlement to a TDIU based solely upon the service-connected depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder is granted, effective for the entire appellate period, so from September 11, 2020.

As indicated in the introduction above, the Veteran is currently in receipt of a TDIU, effective from September 11, 2020, based upon the combined effect of his service-connected physical and mental disabilities on his ability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.  See January 2023 Rating Decision.  The Veteran asserts that a TDIU is warranted based solely upon his service-connected psychiatric disability, characterized as "depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder."  See July 2023 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996); July 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182).  

As a threshold matter, the Board notes that the Veteran meets the preliminary schedular criteria for a TDIU based solely upon his service-connected psychiatric disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) since September 11, 2020, the effective date of service connection for depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder, as the rating for his psychiatric disorder exceeds 60 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  

The question remains, then, whether the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder precluded him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment (work that is more than marginal, which permits the individual to earn a "living wage") at any point since September 11, 2020.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991).  The fact that a veteran may be unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not determinative.  Rather, as noted, the ultimate question is whether the Veteran, because of service-connected disabilities, is incapable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he can find employment.  Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363.  This is so because a disability rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment.  Id.  As noted, neither nonservice-connected disabilities nor advancing age may be considered in the determination.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.19; Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363 (1993).  However, VA does consider such factors as the extent of the service-connected disability, and employment and educational background.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(b), 4.19.

The Board has considered the Veteran's educational and employment background.  In this regard, his post-service occupational experience includes numerous jobs characterized as brief periods of employment, including working as a "meat cutter," a sales clerk, a driver/mechanic, and "doing flooring."  See, e.g., September 2020 VA Mental Disorders Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) (describing the Veteran's occupational history, characterized by "difficulty maintaining employment with frequently quitting jobs after a very short time," and having many "'side jobs' with frequent periods of homelessness"); December 2020 Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (VA Form 21-8940) (listing previous employers and job descriptions).  The evidence further reflects that the Veteran attended high school through eleventh grade but did not graduate.  See id.  There is no evidence that he has undergone any additional education or training.

?

The Veteran maintains that the manifestations of his service-connected psychiatric disorder, alone and without consideration of his physical impairments, have precluded him from employment.  Importantly, as noted above, the ultimate question is not whether the Veteran can actually find employment, but whether, in light of his service-connected disabilities, he is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment.  See Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. At 363.  And in the instant case, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to a TDIU based solely on the Veteran's service-connected depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder have been met for the entire appellate period.

In this regard, the Board notes that records of mental health evaluation dated during the appellate period, including the September 2020, November 2022, and January 2023 VA psychiatric examination reports, indicate symptoms and manifestations of his service-connected psychiatric pathology including depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; chronic sleep impairment; impaired judgment; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting; and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  See, e.g., September 2020 VA Mental Disorders DBQ (reflecting psychiatric symptoms and manifestations including anxiety; suspiciousness; chronic sleep impairment; impaired judgment; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting; and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships); November 2022 VA Mental Disorders DBQ (diagnosing depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder productive of symptoms including depressed mood; anxiety; chronic sleep impairment; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting; and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships); January 2023 VA Mental Disorders DBQ (identifying psychiatric symptoms including depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; chronic sleep impairment; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting, and finding that these manifestations were productive of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood).

Additionally, the November 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's current unemployment was "due to his struggles getting along with others and overall low stress tolerance" and further opined that the Veteran's "significant mental health symptoms," including specifically his "sleep disturbance, concentration problems, low energy, low motivation, difficulty adapting to stressful situations and an inability to establish and maintain relationships with people," result in a substantial impairment in his ability to "sustain employment."  See November 2022 VA Mental Disorders and Medical Opinion DBQs.  

In light of the foregoing, and resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the effects of the manifestations of his service-connected depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder were sufficiently incapacitating as to result in unemployability in light of the severity of his symptoms, occupational and educational history, and experience.

This is further supported by the March 2021 psychological evaluation submitted by the Veteran in support of his claim.  See March 2021 Medical Opinion from C.M., PhD, HSPP.  Based upon a clinical interview of the Veteran, conducted via videoconference and a review of the Veteran's entire VA claims file, including the Veteran's private and VA medical records, the prior VA examination reports, his lay statements, his educational attainment, and his occupational history, C.M. concluded that the symptoms and manifestations of the Veteran's psychiatric pathology "have ultimately rendered him fully unable to successfully secure and follow substantially gainful employment" throughout the relevant appellate period.  See id.  In so finding, C.M. noted that the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder is manifested by "extreme difficulty with focus, concentration, affect, judgment, and tolerance in trusting interactions with people such as supervisors and co-workers," which has resulted in an impaired ability to "interact with others at work, stay on task at work, and be reliable and effective in a competitive work environment."  See id.  Accordingly, "given the severity and persistence of [the Veteran's] symptoms as well as his inconsistent and sporadic work history," C.M. opined that "the Veteran's psychiatric symptom presentation alone has rendered him fully unable to sustain gainful employment since at least February 2019, when he last worked."  Id.  

The Board finds the March 2021 psychological evaluation from C.M. to be highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim, as it represents the informed conclusions of a medical professional with relevant expertise, is based on a clinical interview of the Veteran and a review of all pertinent medical and lay evidence of record, and is supported by a thorough, clear, well-reasoned explanation with citations to both the evidence of record and relevant medical scholarship.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (finding that the probative value of an opinion comes from its reasoning); Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448 (2000) (indicating that the Board may determine the probative value of opinions based on their detail and persuasiveness, and the author's access to a Veteran's records).  Accordingly, the March 2021 psychological evaluation and opinion carries significant probative weight in the Board's determination.  See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995).  Moreover, there is no expert opinion evidence that directly contradicts the March 2021 opinion.  In this regard, the Board notes that the VA examination reports and opinions adduced during the pendency of the relevant period do not explicitly address the question of whether the Veteran's psychiatric pathology precludes substantially gainful employment in light of his level of education, prior work experience, and training.  See September 2020, November 2022, and January 2023 VA Mental Disorders DBQs.   

Furthermore, as discussed, the ultimate question of whether a Veteran is capable of substantially gainful employment is not a medical one; rather, that determination is for the adjudicator.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In this regard, the Board further notes that "substantially gainful employment" is defined as work which is more than marginal.  See Moore, 1 Vet. App. 356; see also Withers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 139, 150-51 (2018) ("Unless the concept of sedentary work is clarified through VA's regulatory process, the meaning and relevance of the term will have to be discerned on a case-by-case basis from the medical and lay evidence presented and in light of each veteran's education, training, and work history.").  In the instant case, it is not clear that the type of work the Veteran could perform would meet that requirement given the evidence of the symptoms and resultant functional impairments caused by his service-connected psychiatric disorder, as detailed above.  See Withers, 30 Vet. App. at 150-51.  This is especially so when his employment history and educational and vocational attainment are taken into consideration.  See id.

In sum, having carefully considered the Veteran's contentions, his education and employment background, and all of the limitations imposed on him as a consequence of his service-connected condition, and resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder has rendered him incapable of substantially gainful employment throughout the appellate period.  Accordingly, a TDIU based solely upon the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder is granted.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.16(a), (b).  See also 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

SMC

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), when a veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total and has additional service-connected disability independently ratable at 60 percent or more, he is entitled to SMC.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1).  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that VA has a "well-established" duty to maximize a claimant's benefits.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993); see also Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280.  This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a claimant's disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 294 (finding that SMC "benefits are to be accorded when a Veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim").

As relevant to this case, special monthly compensation is payable if a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as total, and has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  A "single service-connected disability rated as total" under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is not limited to cases where a 100 percent rating has been assigned via the application of one or more diagnostic codes in the rating schedule; rather, entitlement to TDIU may serve as the "total" rating for the purposes of special monthly compensation at the (s) rate if the TDIU is predicated upon a single disability.  See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280.

2. Entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted, effective for the entire appellate period, so from September 11, 2020.

As detailed above, a TDIU has been assigned, effective from September 11, 2020, for a single service-connected disability, namely the Veteran's depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280.  See also 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  Other disabilities for which service connection is in effect during that period involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems include lumbosacral strain with degenerative disc disease (evaluated as 40 percent disabling from September 11, 2020, forward); left knee instability (evaluated as 20 percent disabling from September 11, 2020, forward); sleep apnea (evaluated as 30 percent disabling from December 3, 2020, forward); right knee status post meniscal tear - instability (evaluated as 20 percent disabling from December 21, 2020, forward); right knee status post meniscal tear with degenerative arthritis and limited flexion (evaluated as 10 percent disabling from July 17, 2017, forward, and as 20 percent disabling from December 21, 2020, forward); right knee, status post meniscal tear with removal of semilunar cartilage (evaluated as 10 percent disabling from December 21, 2020, forward); left lower extremity radiculopathy - femoral nerve (evaluated as 10 percent disabling from September 11, 2020, forward); left knee strain with degenerative arthritis (evaluated as 10 percent disabling from September 11, 2020, forward); and right knee surgical scars (evaluated as noncompensable from December 21, 2020, forward).  See December 2024 Rating Decision Codesheet.  These other disabilities command a combined rating of at least 60 percent since September 11, 2020.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.25 (Combined ratings table).

?

Accordingly, the criteria for entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) are satisfied, and therefore SMC at the (s) rate is granted from September 11, 2020 (the earliest effective date available based on the establishment of TDIU on the basis of the Veteran's depressive disorder with anxious distress and cannabis use disorder, as discussed above).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
