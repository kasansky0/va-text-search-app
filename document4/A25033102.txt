ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a deviated nasal septum is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's deviated nasal septum is proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected sinusitis with sinus headaches.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for deviated nasal septum have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2012 to December 2012.  He appeals a September 2024 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denying service connection for deviated nasal septum.

In a June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for a deviated septum.  In June 2024, the Veteran timely submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the June 2024 rating decision.  In September 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2024 rating decision.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a).

The allowable time to switch dockets at the Board has not expired.  However, as the Board is granting this appeal full, any further pause would only cause unnecessary delay to the appeals process with no additional benefit to the Veteran.  Accordingly, adjudication is appropriate.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Service Connection

A veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation if there is a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110.

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that a disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

A disability which is the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall be service-connected.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  In Spicer v. McDonough, the Federal Circuit held that § 1110 plainly requires compensation when a service-connected disease or injury is a "but-for cause of a present-day disability."  Further, nothing in the statute limits § 1110 to onset or etiological causes of a worsening in functionality.  61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

Importantly, the Federal Circuit also invalidated 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) entitled "aggravation of nonservice-connected disabilities" as unlawful and inconsistent with 38 U.S.C. § 1110.  Id. at 1366.

Further, as the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held in Ward v. Wilkie, a permanent worsening of a disability is not required for secondary service connection; rather "any incremental increase in disability . . . in nonservice-connected disabilities resulting from service-connected conditions" can be service connected.  31 Vet. App. 233, 239 (2019).

Further, in the September 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran's deviated nasal septum is secondary to his service-connected sinusitis with headaches.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding and does not find the AOJ committed clear and unmistakable error in its determination.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

A VA examiner found the Veteran's deviated nasal septum is at least as likely as not due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected condition.  See February 2024 VA medical opinion.  The February 2024 VA examiner found the Veteran had "[d]eviated nasal septum ([t]raumatic)" but also that the Veteran's deviated septum was not traumatic.  See February 2024 VA examination report.  Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds he had a traumatic deviated septum.

As a result, the Board finds that, in this particular case, the Veteran's deviated nasal septum was proximately caused and resulted from his service-connected sinusitis with sinus headaches.  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for deviated nasal septum is warranted.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
