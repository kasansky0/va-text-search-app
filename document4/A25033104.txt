ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's posttraumatic stress disorder is a result of his active duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2004 to April 2005, from April 2009 to June 2010, and from May 2019 to April 2020, with additional service in the National Guard. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in April 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder.

The Veteran contends entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

As it relates to PTSD, service connection requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (diagnosis of a mental disorder conforming to the DSM-5 supported by the findings on the examination report), a link established by medical evidence between current symptoms and an in-service stressor, and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in service stressor occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f). As favorably found by the AOJ, the Veteran's in service stressor is conceded based on his service in Kuwait and Iraq.

The Veteran is generally competent to report his own lay symptomatology but not to provide a medical diagnosis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 471 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). When a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature," and is capable of lay observation. Barr, supra. While the Veteran is competent in certain situations to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition such as a broken leg or varicose veins, he is not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions. Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007). Although medical evidence is generally necessary for a nexus to service, lay evidence can be sufficient to show continuity of symptoms after service, as a foundation for a nexus opinion, or to link chronic in-service symptoms to the same diagnosed current disability, or as a substitute for a nexus. Jandreau, supra.

A medical opinion must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh, as it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes to the probative value of a medical opinion. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102. The benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies when the evidence is in approximate balance or nearly equal. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

The Board finds the Veteran has a current PTSD disability. While the Veteran underwent a VA examination in December 2023 at which the VA examiner declined to offer a PTSD diagnosis, VA medical treatment records clearly reflect a diagnosis of PTSD that conforms to the DSM-5 and is supported by the findings at the VA treatment visits. In this respect, the Board notes the Veteran received additional mental health treatment from VA, including prescription of a medication for his chronic PTSD, which the VA examiner did not review because it was added to the record after the VA examination. Consequently, the Board finds the VA examiner's opinion declining to offer a PTSD diagnosis or any other mental health disability diagnosis is inadequate as it is not based on all of the medical evidence of record. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's conceded in-service stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD. VA medical records also unequivocally show that there is a link between the Veteran's current PTSD symptoms and the conceded in-service stressor.

Upon review, the Board finds the Veteran's PTSD is a result of his active duty service. Therefore, service-connection for PTSD is warranted. 38 U.S.C. §5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).
