REMANDED

Service connection for right knee condition is remanded.

Service connection for left knee condition is remanded.

Service connection for right shoulder condition is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2008 to August 2008, from May 2011 to August 2011 and from July 2016 to March 2017.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In January 2023 the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) seeking service connection for a bilateral knee condition which was denied by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in a July 2023 rating decision. In February 2023 the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking service connection for a bilateral shoulder condition which was denied by the AOJ in a June 2023 supplemental claim rating decision. In September 2023 the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review appealing both the June and July 2023 rating decisions. In January 2024 the AOJ implicitly found that new and relevant evidence had been submitted and again denied the claims. In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket, disagreeing with all but the denial of service connection for the left shoulder disability. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June and July 2023 AOJ decisions. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued those decisions the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of the claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.

Bilateral Knees

1. Service connection for right knee condition

2. Service connection for left knee condition

The Veteran and his representative contend he has a bilateral knee condition as a result of his active duty service. See January 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim. Specifically, the Veteran contends that he started experiencing knee pain during service which continues currently, with symptoms such as stiffness causing him mobility issues, and sometimes requiring the Veteran to apply compression and elevate his knees. See February 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim. 

In an August 2, 2017 post-service treatment record it is noted that the Veteran complained of knee pain. In July 2023 the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim, without requesting a VA medical examination and opinion. In order for a VA examination and associated opinion to be warranted, the evidence of record must indicate that a current disability may be associated with a Veteran's military service. 38 U.S.C. §5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. §3.159(c)(4)(i); see McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). This evidentiary requirement is a low threshold. Id. The Board finds that the Veteran's competent statements describing the in-service onset of a bilateral knee condition resulting from his military occupational specialties of security forces journeyman and rescue fire fighter, are sufficient to meet the low threshold, and that there is otherwise insufficient evidence to decide the claim. See Id.; see also February 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim. Therefore, not providing the Veteran with a VA medical examination was a duty to assist error and a remand is warranted to cure the deficiency.   

 Bilateral Shoulders

3. Service connection for right shoulder condition

The Veteran and his representative contend that the Veteran has a right shoulder condition as a result of his active duty service. See February 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim. Specifically, the Veteran contends that he suffers from limitation in range of motion as well as pain when he lifts his arm over his head, that he feels pain during cold and/or rainy weather and a lack of strength when lifting his with his right arm. See February 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim

The Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable finding that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with a right shoulder strain, as determined by a March 14, 2023 VA examiner. 38 CFR §3.104(c); June 2023 Rating Decision. The remaining inquiry is whether the Veteran's right shoulder strain was caused or aggravated by his service.

The Veteran reported an in-service injury to his right shoulder as well as specific descriptions of the effects of his duties and activities on both shoulders while in active service. See February 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim. A March 2023 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with right shoulder strain but did not provide a medical nexus opinion and the AOJ did request one before denying the Veteran's claim. This was a duty to assist error, and a remand is warranted to cure the deficiency.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA Examination with an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right and left knee conditions.

The clinician must address the following: 

(A) Determine if there is a current diagnosis for each knee.

(B) If there is a current diagnosis, then the clinician must opine whether it is at least as likely as not (the favorable and unfavorable evidence of record is in approximate balance or is nearly equal) that the Veteran's right and/or left knee condition(s) are due to his service.

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA Examination with an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right shoulder condition. 

The clinician must do the following: 

(A)	 Provide an addendum opinion to the March 2023 VA Examination Report as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's right shoulder condition is due to his service.

In reaching a conclusion regarding the question posed, the VA examiner must acknowledge and discuss the lay and medical evidence of record. A discussion of the underlying reasons for any opinion expressed must be included in the report, to include reference to pertinent evidence of record and medical literature or treatises where appropriate. If you cannot provide the requested opinion without resorting to speculation, please expressly indicate this and state why that is so (e.g. lack of sufficient information/evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).
