Whether the Veteran's request for a waiver of an overpayment debt in the amount of $9,536.17 of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits was timely filed.

REMANDED

The issue of whether the Veteran's request for a waiver of an overpayment debt in the amount of $9,536.17 of VA compensation benefits was timely filed is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from September 2006 to November 2014. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2020 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). 

In the February 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Whether the request for a waiver of an overpayment for VA compensation benefits was timely filed.

Under applicable criteria, a request for waiver of an indebtedness shall only be considered if made within 180 days following the date of a notice of indebtedness to the debtor. The 180-day period may be extended if the individual requesting waiver demonstrates, as a result of error by either the VA or the postal authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, there was a delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing. If the debtor does substantiate there was such a delay in the receipt of the notice of indebtedness, the 180-day period shall be computed from the date of the debtor's actual receipt of the notice of indebtedness. 38 U.S.C. § 5302 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 1.963 (b)(2).

In January 2019, the Debt Management Center (DMC) sent the Veteran a first demand letter of his overpayment debt in the amount of $9,536.17.  Under the section "What are your Options," the letter indicates that the Veteran may request a waiver.  The section directs the Veteran to the back of the letter for more information.  The back side of the letter is not of record. 

In a January 2020 decision, the COWC found that the Veteran's November 2019 waiver request was untimely.  

Given the state of the record, a remand is warranted for the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error.  In that regard, the Board is unable to determine if the Veteran was properly notified of the timeframe for requesting a waiver as the back side of the letter notifying the Veteran about his options is not of record.  Further, the Board also notes that the January 2020 COWC decision found that the Veteran submitted a waiver request in November 2019.  However, the actual waiver request (and any associated FSR) has not been associated with the Veteran's electronic claims folder. Accordingly, remand under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) for this circumstance remains appropriate.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the back side of the January 2019 DMC demand letter (FL 4-474b-3) which explained the Veteran's options for repayment.

Under the section titled, "What Are Your Options," it indicates that the Veteran has the right to request a waiver and refers the Veteran to the back of the letter for more information.  

If unable to obtain, document what steps were taken. 

2. Then, obtain and upload the Veteran's waiver request to the electronic claims folder.  

The January 2020 COWC decision found that the Veteran submitted a waiver request in November 2019.  However, the actual waiver request (and any associated FSR) has not been associated with the Veteran's electronic claims folder.
