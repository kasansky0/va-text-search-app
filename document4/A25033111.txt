FINDING OF FACT

On April 8, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received written notification from the appellant's authorized representative withdrawing the appeal for increased ratings for cervical degenerative disc disease (claimed as chronic neck pain), right upper radiculopathy, right shoulder bursitis, and lumbar degenerative disc disease (claimed as chronic back pain). 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the issues of increased ratings for cervical degenerative disc disease (claimed as chronic neck pain), right upper radiculopathy, right shoulder bursitis, and lumbar degenerative disc disease (claimed as chronic back pain) have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant, served on active duty from January 1980 to January 2010.  

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), creates a new framework of review for appellants disagreeing with the Agency of Original Jurisdiction's (AOJ) decision on a claim.

Following a July 2020 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision, which continued the disability ratings for cervical degenerative disc disease (claimed as chronic neck pain), right upper radiculopathy, right shoulder bursitis, and lumbar degenerative disc disease (claimed as chronic back pain), on July 14, 2021, VA received a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, disagreeing with the disability ratings, and appealing the issues to the Board.

The Appeal is Withdrawn

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

On April 8, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant's authorized representative of withdrawal of this appeal.  Specifically, VA received a letter from the representative explicitly stating that the Veteran was withdrawing the July 14, 2021 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and that he understands the consequences of withdrawing the appeal.  

As the Veteran, through the representative, has withdrawn this appeal in its entirety, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
