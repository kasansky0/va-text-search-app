ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for vision impairment is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The most persuasive evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's currently diagnosed hypertension did not have its onset during active-duty service, did not manifest within one year of separation from service, and was not otherwise etiologically related to service.

2. The most persuasive evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's currently diagnosed sleep apnea did not have its onset during active-duty service, did not manifest within one year of separation from service, and was not otherwise etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1114, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1982 to August 1985.

The February 2024 rating decision constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the February 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and bilateral cataracts and dry eye syndrome.  The AOJ further found that a nexus or link between the Veteran's claimed sleep apnea and claimed vision impairment has been established as service treatment records (STRs) show a complaint in service.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge as the Board Review option.  As such, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has not appointed a representative and proceeds pro se.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Generally, service connection requires: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For certain chronic diseases, a presumption of service connection arises if the disease is manifested to a degree of 10 percent within one year following discharge from service.  That presumption is rebuttable by probative evidence to the contrary. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).  For those listed chronic conditions, a showing of continuity of symptoms affords an alternative route to service connection when the requirements for application of the presumption are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Continuity of symptomatology may establish service connection if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was "noted" during service; (2) there is post-service evidence of the same symptomatology; and (3) there is medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307 (2007).

Notwithstanding the provisions relating to presumptive service connection, a veteran may establish service connection for a disability with proof of actual direct causation.  Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

In determining whether service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit-of-the-doubt when the competing evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal." That is, exact equipoise is not required to trigger the favorable benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

The Veteran asserts that her hypertension onset in approximately January 1983 during active service due to severe job stress from her work environment and from her poor diet as provided by the military cafeteria.  See July 2023 Fully Developed Claim.  During her February 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported onset of her hypertension in 1983 and that her initial symptoms were headache, fatigue, depression, and sleep issues.  

The question before the Board is whether the Veteran's current hypertension is etiologically related to her active-duty service.  Based on a careful review of all the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence weighs against finding service connection for hypertension is warranted.

The Board notes that for VA purposes, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm., or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm.

The Veteran's enlistment examination is normal.  Blood pressure readings during active-service included 130/80, 130/90, 140/90, 100/70, 120/50, 102/70, 104/50, 126/86, 110/82, 116/68, 100/78, 100/80, 110/80, 100/70, 116/78, 100/74, 124/78, 120/80, and 100/62.  The Veteran's active-duty STRs do not reflect a diagnosis of hypertension. 

The Veteran's Reserve records note "HTN x 3days," and a diagnosis of "borderline elevated BP," following a reading of 130/94.  See June 2, 1986, and January 28, 1987, STRs

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's active-duty STRs contain two readings of diastolic blood pressure at 90mm and that Reserve records within one-year of active-duty discharge contain an elevated reading of diastolic blood pressure at 94mm.  However, these three episodes do not represent diastolic blood pressure that is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and systolic blood pressure that is predominantly 160mm., or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm. to support a hypertension diagnosis.  Indeed, the Veteran was not diagnosed with hypertension in service or within a year thereafter.

At a February 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported that her hypertension began in 1983 when she went to the hospital with complaints of headache, depression, weight gain, and sleep issues.  She reported that she was seen at medical and given medication for hypertension and diet.  The Veteran reported current symptoms of headache and that she was on continuous medication for her hypertension.  Following an objective evaluation, the February 2024 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with hypertension.  The February 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's hypertension was less likely than not incurred in or caused by active-duty service.  In providing a rationale, the VA examiner noted the Veteran's normal enlistment examination and that the STRs show normal blood pressure until 1986 when the Veteran was in Reserve status and seen for a blood pressure check with no diagnosis of hypertension.  The Veteran's earliest diagnosis of hypertension was in 1987 when the Veteran was diagnosed with borderline hypertension.  The examiner noted that doing Reserve time, there are a lot of outside influences that can account for an increase in blood pressure and that therefore a nexus to the Veteran's active service (which ended in August 1985) cannot be established.

Initially, the Board recognizes that hypertension is a chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  The Board has considered whether the Veteran is entitled to presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3).  However, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Veteran, available private treatment records document that the Veteran was noted to have borderline hypertension in 1987 (but not an actual diagnosis of hypertension), and essential hypertension in 2020, which is approximately 35 years after her discharge from active-duty service.  As noted above, the Veteran's active-duty STRs do not document any findings related to any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for hypertension and the earliest diagnosis of borderline hypertension was in January 1987, more than one year after the Veteran's 1985 discharge.  Thus, the Board finds that the evidence does not show that the Veteran's hypertension manifested within one year of separation from service; nor does it show that she had continuous symptoms of hypertension following service.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's hypertension, as a chronic disease, is not entitled to service connection on a presumptive basis.

The Board must still consider whether the Veteran's hypertension is directly related to her active-duty service.  However, for the following reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that a relationship exists between the Veteran's currently diagnosed hypertension and her active service.

The Board finds probative the February 2024 VA examiner's nexus opinion as the examiner considered the Veteran's medical history, STRs, military history, and detailed all findings and conclusions with an adequate rationale such that the Board can make a fully informed decision.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).  The Veteran's active-duty STRs lack any mention of diagnosis or treatment for hypertension. While the Veteran's active service STRs contain two elevated readings and her Reserve records contain an elevated rating, as discussed above these isolated readings do not constitute predominant readings.  The Board further finds it significant that other than a diagnosis of borderline hypertension in 1987, the earliest evidence of a diagnosis of hypertension was in 2020, approximately 35 years after the Veteran's active service.  Accordingly, the Board finds there is no competent or credible evidence of an in-service incurrence of hypertension. 

The Veteran has not presented any competent medical evidence that her hypertension was etiologically related to active-duty service.  The only evidence in support of the Veteran's contentions is her own lay assertions.  Lay evidence may be competent to establish a medical etiology or nexus.  However, given that the Veteran has not demonstrated that she has the requisite specialized knowledge or training, the Board finds that the Veteran is not competent to provide such a medically complex opinion as to the etiology of her hypertension.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Thus, the Veteran's lay assertions have little probative value. 

In summary, the evidence is neither evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's claim for service connection for hypertension is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against service connection for hypertension.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. §5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Accordingly, the service connection claim for hypertension is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for sleep apnea which she asserts onset in approximately May 1983 and that she was unable to sleep/always tired, she reported to the Fort McClellan Hospital at that time.  On examination in February 2024, the Veteran reported symptoms began in 1983 after she became depressed, gained weight and could not sleep at night.  See February 2024 VA Examination

The question before the Board is whether the Veteran's current sleep apnea is etiologically related to her active-duty service.  Based on a careful review of all the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence weighs against finding service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.

STRs contain a provider's note of the Veteran's decreased problem sleeping.  See March 1, 1983, and October 9, 1984, STR.  STRs are otherwise negative for complaints, treatments, and diagnoses associated with obstructive sleep apnea.

Private treatment records reflect that the Veteran was first diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2021.  See July 19, 2021 Private Treatment Note

After an objective evaluation and review of the lay and medical evidence, the February 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea is less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner offered the rationale that the Veteran STRs are silent for sleep issues and in light of her 2021 diagnosis, about 35 years post active service, that a nexus could not be formed.  The February 2024 VA examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  Moreover, the VA examiner possesses the necessary education, training, and expertise to provide the requested opinion.  Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).

Finally, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's sincere belief that her sleep apnea is related to active military service.  The Veteran is competent to report on matters observed or within her personal knowledge and is, therefore, competent to make statements regarding her symptoms and medical history.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  However, a probative medical opinion on the etiology or underlying causes of complex conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea, requires the specialized training of a medical professional.  In this case, as a layperson not shown to possess appropriate medical training and expertise, the Veteran is not competent to render a persuasive or competent medical opinion on whether such disability was incurred in or caused by her military service.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir 2006).  Therefore, any opinion by the Veteran regarding the etiology of her obstructive sleep apnea, is not competent evidence.

Therefore, given the probative opinion of the February 2024 VA examiner and the lack of evidence to the contrary, the persuasive balance of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's sleep apnea is related to service.  As the persuasive evidence is against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Unfortunately, the remaining claim must be remanded to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error that occurred prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal.  As the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(ii).

3. Entitlement to service connection for vision impairment is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for vision impairment which she asserts is due to dim lighting/working in the dark corner of office and long hours typing during active service.  See July 2023 Fully Developed Claim.  On examination in February 2024, the Veteran reported that her bilateral cataracts onset in 2022 and that her dry eye syndrome onset gradually in 1982.  There was no trauma, incident, or event that led to the condition although the Veteran reported her belief that it may have been due to the poor lighting and computer work during service. 

The February 2024 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral cataracts and bilateral dry eye syndrome.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's vision impairment is less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  As a rationale, the examiner explained the eye (vision) condition noted during service is consistent with the refractive amblyopia.  There is no association of refractive amblyopia resulting in dry eye syndrome or cataracts. The veteran's dry eye syndrome and cataracts are more consistent with being from age-related changes.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's refractive amblyopia is refractive in nature and not considered an ocular disease/diagnosis and therefore it did not warrant a medical opinion.

In providing his negative opinion, the examiner did not address the Veteran's report during her examination that her dry eye syndrome onset gradually in 1982, during active service.  Moreover, the Veteran's STRs during active duty contain a complaint of eye pain and report of itchy eyes.  STRs further contain eye diagnoses of CMA and SMA.  The examiner did not address these in-service diagnoses or how, if it all, they relate to the Veteran's currently-diagnosed bilateral cataracts and/or bilateral dry eye syndrome.  See October 9, 10, 1984 STRs

Based on the above, the Board finds the February 2024 VA examiner's opinion  inadequate.  Therefore, remand is required to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error by obtaining an opinion that is adequate to decide the claim.

Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a VA medical opinion concerning the nature and etiology of the Veteran's currently-diagnosed bilateral cataracts and bilateral dry eye syndrome.  A full VA examination need not be scheduled unless it is deemed necessary by the examiner or otherwise required by the evidence.  The examiner must review the Veteran's claims file in its entirety, to include a copy of this REMAND.  The completion of this review must be noted in the report. 

Thereafter, the examiner is asked to provide a complete and thorough medical opinion addressing the following:

(a)	Are the Veteran's bilateral cataracts causally related to her active service?

(b)	Is the Veteran's bilateral dry eye syndrome causally related to her active service?

(c)	Address how, if at all, the Veteran's in-service diagnoses of CMA and SMA relate to the Veteran's currently-diagnosed bilateral cataracts and/or bilateral dry eye syndrome.  See October 9, 10, 1984 STRs

In providing the requested opinion, the examiner must specifically consider and address the following pertinent evidence:

"	Active-duty STRs reflecting a complaint of eye pain and report of itchy eyes and eye diagnoses of CMA and SMA.  See October 9, 10, 1984 STRs

"	The Veteran's assertion that her vision impairment is due to dim lighting/working in the dark corner of office and long hours typing during active service.  See July 2023 Fully Developed Claim

"	The Veteran's report during her examination that her bilateral cataracts onset in 2022 and that her dry eye syndrome onset gradually in 1982.  See February 2024 VA Eye Conditions Examination

The Board emphasizes that it is not determining whether or not the Veteran's statements in support of her claim iscredible at this time, as the additional development set forth in the remand directives could impact that determination.  Although the Board is requesting a medical opinion regarding the claim, this is for thoroughness and not based on a finding as to credibility.

A complete rationale must be provided for any opinion offered.
