REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force from November 1981 to May 1984. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In September 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), in which he elected the Direct Review Lane. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Withdrawal of Claims

The Board has jurisdiction when there is a question of law or fact on appeal to the Secretary.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. Withdrawal may be made by an appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. An appeal withdrawal is effective when received by the Board.  Id. 

Normally, to be valid, a written withdrawal must be in writing and include: (1) the name of the Veteran (or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran); (2) the applicable VA file number; and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  Id.

In the present case, the Veteran called VA in October 2023, identified the claims on appeal and requested to withdraw the appeal. The legal administrative specialist who recorded the conversation informed the Veteran that he was authorized to receive evidentiary information and statements, which could result in changes in VA benefits.  See October 2023 VA 27-0820. Although the Veteran did not submit a written withdrawal, the report of contact effectively memorialized the Veteran's explicit withdrawal that was made during the telephone conversation. 

The Court has previously found that a report of contact form can provide sufficient evidence that a claim had been withdrawn in Hanson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 29 (1996). In Hanson, the Court determined that withdrawal through the report of contact form had a plausible basis in the record because the social worker had no motive to falsify the information, and other contemporaneous circumstances supported the finding that the claim was withdrawn. The Court identified other contemporaneous circumstances, including the fact that VA had not performed an examination, the appellant did not mention the withdrawn claim in a subsequent notice of disagreement, the statement of the case focused only on an issue that had not been withdrawn, and the appellant did not object to VA's failure to adjudicate the withdrawn issue.

The Court held that a report of contact could constitute insufficient evidence to establish that a claim had been withdrawn in Warren v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 214 (2016). In Warren, the Court emphasized that withdrawal of an appeal is only effective where the withdrawal is explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant. The Court identified considerable evidence that the appellant did not intend to withdraw his claim, but only to remove his claim from the decision review officer (DRO) process. This included statements by the Veteran that he was withdrawing his request for DRO review and instead requesting a Board hearing and reiterating his desire for a Board hearing. The Court also identified a report of information noting that the Veteran desired a Board hearing and was unsure if this was stated on the substantive appeal, as it only referenced a withdrawal of the claim from the DRO process; a letter accompanying supporting medical evidence with a notation that the evidence was in support of his pending claim; and hearing testimony that the appellant did not intend to withdraw his claim.

Having thoroughly reviewed the record, the Board finds that, although the withdrawal in question was made via telephone conversation, the evidence of the record more closely resembles the situation in Hanson than that in Warren. Here, as in Hanson, there is no evidence indicating that the VA legal administrative specialist had a motive to falsify the information. In the conversation, the legal administrative specialist further informed the Veteran that his statements could result in a change of VA benefits. As such the Board finds that the Veteran's decision was explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action. Unlike Warren, the record contains no verbal or written statements subsequent to the withdrawal that would indicate a belief that the appeal was pending. The Board therefore finds that the Veteran's October 2023 withdrawal was explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action. There remain no allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding. 

Accordingly, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider an appeal in this matter, and the appeal is hereby dismissed.
