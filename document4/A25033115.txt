ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation prior to September 18, 2020, and in excess of 10 percent thereafter, for left hip osteoarthritis and trochanteric pain syndrome based on abduction, adduction, and rotation, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to September 18, 2020, the Veteran's left hip osteoarthritis and trochanteric pain syndrome based on abduction, adduction, and rotation is manifested by at worst painful motion with the ability to cross his legs, external rotation to 45 degrees, abduction to 40 degrees, and adduction to 20 degrees. 

2. From September 18, 2020, the Veteran's left hip osteoarthritis and trochanteric pain syndrome based on abduction, adduction, and rotation is manifested by, at worst, painful motion without the ability to cross his legs, external rotation to 30 degrees, abduction to 30 degrees, and adduction to 20 degrees.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial compensable evaluation prior to September 18, 2020, and in excess of 10 percent thereafter, for left hip osteoarthritis and trochanteric pain syndrome based on abduction, adduction, and rotation, are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5102, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.151, 3.155, 4.1-4.14, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5253.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1979 to May 1983.

This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is from a May and November 2021 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), hereinafter the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In the November 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the notice of the May 2021 AOJ decision (May 24, 2021), which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in the November 2021 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board acknowledges that in the November 2022 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran's attorney listed the issue the Veteran wished to appeal as "evaluation of left hip osteoarthritis and trochanteric pain syndrome based on abduction, adduction, and rotation, to include as secondary to individual unemployability (IU)." Prior to notice of the May 2021 AOJ decision, however, neither the Veteran nor his authorized representative has ever claimed, argued, or presented evidence suggesting that he cannot obtain and maintain employment due to his service-connected disabilities. In addition, the Veteran appears to have maintained gainful employment, with no break in employment, for the entire period on appeal from the June 5, 2018, effective date for the award of service connection for this disability, through the May 2021 decision on appeal. See April 2021 report of VA Hip and Thigh Conditions Examination (documenting the Veteran's report that he was at the time of that examination and for at least the last 5 years had been employed as a senior director at a transportation company). Accordingly, the Board finds that during the period on appeal, a claim for entitlement to a TDIU has not been reasonably raised by the record. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009) (explaining that TDIU "involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability or disabilities, either as part of the initial adjudication of a claim [...] or as part of a claim for increased compensation[,]" and is raised whenever a claimant seeks a higher disability evaluation and "presents cogent evidence of unemployability"); cf. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 24 (2017) (providing that "entitlement to TDIU is not reasonably raised unless the record contains evidence of unemployability, either submitted by the veteran or developed by VA"). Accordingly, entitlement to a TDIU is not before the Board at this time and will not be further addressed herein.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991). If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. After consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, and the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses, are to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged rating" (assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts found) is required. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). Where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating prior to September 18, 2020, and in excess of 10 percent thereafter, for his service-connected left hip osteoarthritis and trochanteric pain syndrome based on abduction, adduction, and rotation (DC 5253). 

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that service connection is also in effect for left hip osteoarthritis and trochanteric pain syndrome based limitation of flexion (DC 5252) and limitation of extension (DC 5251); however, the Veteran specifically only requested higher-level review and appeal of the initial ratings assigned based on left hip abduction, adduction, and rotation under DC 5253. See September 2021 Request for Higher-Level Review, VA Form 20-0996 and November 2022 Notice of Disagreement, VA form 10182. As such, the ratings assigned for limitation of flexion and limitation of extension of the left hip are not currently on appeal and analysis under DCs 5251 and 5252 therefore will not be discussed herein. See De Hart v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 371 (2024).

In addition, the Board acknowledges that other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); see also Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment). While the Board has considered the applicability of other diagnostic codes pertaining to the hip and thigh, the medical evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has ankylosis, flail joint, or impairment of the femur. As such, a different or higher rating under the DCs for these disabilities is not for application. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DCs 5250, 5254-55.

Under DC 5253, a 10 percent rating is warranted for limitation of rotation of affected leg, cannot toe out more than 15 degrees. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for limitation of adduction, cannot cross legs. A maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of abduction, motion lost beyond 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5253.

Turning to the record, the appeal period begins June 5, 2018, which is the effective date for the award of service connection for left hip osteoarthritis and trochanteric pain syndrome based on abduction, adduction, and rotation.

The evidence of record during the period prior to September 18, 2020, includes private primary care notes from Dr. R.D. dating from March 2015 to August 2018 and private orthopedic treatment notes from Dr. K.L. dating from March to June 2018, and report of a December 2018 VA hip and thigh conditions examination.

Private treatment notes are negative for any findings or complaints pertaining to the Veteran's left hip, with exception of notion of "full range of motion of the hip" in a private treatment note from Dr. K.L. dated March 27, 2018, prior to the period on appeal. 

On VA examination in December 2018, the Veteran reported left hip pain with climbing, bending, walking up hills, laying on his left side in bed, when pushing on the lateral side of the hip, and on sitting for long periods making it hard to fly on planes for several hours. He reported he had not sought medical attention for hip pain. He reported taking one Aleve per day for his knee, but it helped improve hip pain. Initial left hip abduction was 40 degrees, initial adduction was 20 degrees, initial external rotation was 45 degrees, and initial internal rotation was 30 degrees. Adduction was not limited such that the Veteran could not cross his legs. Abnormal range of motion of the left hip did not contribute to functional loss, but pain noted on all ranges of motion of the left hip on examination caused functional loss. There was evidence of pain with weightbearing and objective evidence of moderate localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the greater trochanter. There was no objective evidence of crepitus. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions. Pain and lack of endurance significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over a period of time. The examiner was not able to describe limitation of functional ability with repeated use over a period of time in terms of range of motion with notation to see the Veteran's described limitations noted in the history section of the examination report. Flare-ups were denied. Muscle strength testing of the left hip was normal (5/5) on flexion, extension, and abduction. There was no muscle atrophy or ankylosis of the left hip. Functionally, the examiner noted that the Veteran's left hip osteoarthritis and trochanteric pain syndrome affected his ability to do occupational tasks in that it made it difficult to do those parts of his job that involved climbing, going up stairs, and bending, which he was able to do with significant accomodation. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable evaluation for the Veteran's left hip based on limitation of adduction, abduction, and rotation. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain and lack of endurance. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the examiner determined that adduction was not limited such that the Veteran could not cross his legs, and there is no indication that rotation or abduction was limited such that the criteria for a compensable rating have been met.

The Board has contemplated whether a higher rating could be assigned under the DeLuca criteria or 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 or 4.45. No such rating is warranted as the Veteran has already been assigned the minimum 10 percent rating for painful motion under DC 5251. See January 2019 Rating Decision Narrative and Codesheet. Thus, an additional rating based on painful motion under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Petitti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415 (2015) (holding section 4.59 does not stand alone but instead works as a bridge with the limitation-of-motion diagnostic codes when a compensable rating under those diagnostic codes is not warranted).

Turning to the period beginning September 18, 2020, the Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating in excess of 10 percent for his service-connected left hip osteoarthritis and trochanteric pain syndrome based on abduction, adduction, and rotation (DC 5253).

During this period of the appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended effective February 7, 2021. 85 Fed. Reg. 230 (Nov 30, 2020). Those amendments revised select diagnostic codes "to ensure that this portion of the rating schedule uses current medical terminology and provides detailed and updated criteria for the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities." Id. However, the Diagnostic Codes for limitation of motion of the hip were unaffected by the February 7, 2021, regulatory changes.

The evidence during this period of the appeal includes VA hip and thigh examinations dated September 18, 2020, and April 14, 2021.

During the September 2020 VA examination, the Veteran's initial abduction was 35 degrees, initial adduction was 20 degrees, external rotation was 45 degrees and internal rotation was 30 degrees. Adduction was limited such that the Veteran could not cross his legs. There was no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions of left hip range of motion. Pain and weakness significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over a period of time. Estimated range of motion after repeated use was abduction to 35 degrees, adduction to 25 degrees, external rotation to 45 degrees, and internal rotation to 30 degrees. Post-test adduction was limited such that the Veteran could not cross his legs. The Veteran denied flare-ups.

During the April 2021 VA examination, the Veteran's initial abduction was 30 degrees, initial adduction was 25 degrees, external rotation was 30 degrees and internal rotation was 20 degrees with pain on all ranges of motion. There was no change on passive range of motion. Adduction was limited such that the Veteran could not cross his legs. There was no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions of left hip range of motion. Pain and lack of endurance significantly limited functional ability with repeated use time. Estimated range of motion after repeated use was abduction to 30 degrees, adduction to 25 degrees, external rotation to 30 degrees, and internal rotation to 20 degrees. Limitation in adduction after repeated use over time prevented the Veteran from crossing his legs. During flare-ups, the examiner estimated that the Veteran's abduction would be limited to 30 degrees, adduction would be limited to 25 degrees, internal rotation would be limited to 20 degrees, and external rotation would be limited to 30 degrees. The examiner noted that the Veteran would not be able to cross his legs during flare-ups.

On review, the Board finds that from September 18, 2020, a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted as there is no evidence that the Veteran's limitation of abduction is limited to the extent required for a 20 percent evaluation.  Accordingly, a 10 percent evaluation, but no higher, is warranted for left hip osteoarthritis with trochanteric pain syndrome based on limitation of abduction, adduction, and rotation during this period. 

In reaching the above conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021)
