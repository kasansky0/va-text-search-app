REMANDED

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a foot condition is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1987 to September 1990.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 supplemental claim decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for a foot condition most recently addressed in an October 2022 rating decision.  In April 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket in the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider any evidence submitted after the April 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for a foot condition, the AOJ will consider any evidence it could not consider when adjudicating those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

A remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the April 2024 supplemental claim decision on appeal.  The AOJ obtained a March 2024 medical opinion; however, it does not adequately explain whether the Veteran's foot disorders other than pes planus had their onset in service or were otherwise related to service.

The Veteran contends that his foot condition began with military service, rucking, and marching in boots, where he used to get blisters on the bottom of his feet.  He experiences calluses and pain in the bottom of his feet, with aching and pulling of muscles under the feet, and he has almost fallen at times.  See March 7, 2024, C&P Exam.

The Veteran's January 1987 entrance examination noted mild asymptomatic pes planus.  Service treatment records are otherwise silent for foot issues, and the Veteran signed a waiver to forgo a separation medical examination.  July 26, 2022, Military Personnel Record.

VA treatment records show he has received podiatry care since 2011 demonstrating multiple plantar calluses, osteoarthritis keratomas metatarsalgia with a history of gout, bilateral posterior calcaneal spur, and left first toe mild hallux valgus, and left foot vascular calcification.  See October 20, 2022, CAPRI.

The Veteran submitted some private pedorthist treatment records, which show bilateral metatarsalgia with the onset date of 2014 due to overuse or overexertion.  See November 1, 2023, Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

The Veteran also submitted a private chiropractor's evaluation and medical opinion.  See November 16, 2023, Disability Benefits Questionnaire; November 16, 2023, Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

Chiropractic care is nontherapeutic care with the sole purpose of contributing to health by correcting vertebral subluxations.  See DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY at 338 (33d ed. 2019).

Although the Board acknowledges that chiropractors typically focus on vertebral subluxations, that fact alone does not render their opinions per se invalid or incompetent regarding certain musculoskeletal issues, including the feet.  See Cox v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 563, 569 (2007) (explaining that medical professionals from various fields may be competent to opine on medical matters they are qualified to address).  Nevertheless, the chiropractor's conclusions in this case appear to rely solely on the Veteran's lay assertions.  The record does not show that the chiropractor reviewed the Veteran's full medical history, including his longstanding foot treatment records and the podiatry and pedorthist findings attributing his foot disabilities to overuse in the 2010s.  Consequently, the chiropractor's report provides only data and conclusions without a reasoned medical explanation linking the Veteran's current condition to service.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  Accordingly, the Board affords no probative weight to the chiropractor's opinion.

A March 2024 VA examiner noted the Veteran had a diagnosis of pes planus and plantar fasciitis.  The examiner opined that the pes planus was not due to or aggravated by the Veteran's service because the pes planus pre-existed service and the record contains no evidence of worsening during service.  See March 7, 2024, C&P Exam.

The Board finds the March 2024 VA examiner's opinion regarding pes planus probative; however, the opinion does not provide sufficient detail to fully inform the Board on its medical question, which is whether the Veteran has a foot condition (including plantar calluses, osteoarthritis keratomas metatarsalgia with a history of gout, bilateral posterior calcaneal spur, left first toe mild hallux valgus, and left foot vascular calcification) due to service.  Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 109 (2012).

Accordingly, as the medical opinions provided are inadequate, a remand is required to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the April 2024 supplemental claim decision on the issue of entitlement to service connection for a foot condition.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination (if possible, with one of his two VA podiatrists) for his foot condition (including plantar calluses, osteoarthritis keratomas metatarsalgia with a history of gout, bilateral posterior calcaneal spur, left first toe mild hallux valgus, and left foot vascular calcification).

The examiner should review the claims file.  For any foot condition which the examiner finds to have been present at any time since May 2022, the examiner is asked to respond to the following:

Is the Veteran's current foot condition related to service, including his in-service rucking and marching in boots where he used to get blisters on the bottom of his feet?

Provide a rationale to support the opinion(s).
