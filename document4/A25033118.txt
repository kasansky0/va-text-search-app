ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hypertension is related to his service-connected left knee disability, to include obesity as an intermediary step.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hypertension as secondary to service-connected left knee disability, to include obesity as an intermediary step, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1976 to April 1982.

This matter returns to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2019 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) rating decision.

In the August 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2019 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) granted the parties' joint motion for partial remand and directed the Board to consider favorable evidence regarding a secondary theory of entitlement: obesity as an intermediate step.

Service Connection

Entitlement to service connection on a direct basis requires (1) evidence of current nonservice-connected disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current nonservice-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018).

Service connection on a secondary basis requires (1) evidence of a current nonservice-connected disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) evidence establishing that the service-connected disability either (a) caused, or (b) aggravated, the nonservice-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc); see also Spicer v. McDonough, No. 2022-1239 (Fed. Cir. March 8, 2023) (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead held a "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection).

While VA does not recognize obesity as a stand-alone disability, indirect secondary service connection can be granted with obesity acting as an intermediate step. See VAOPGCPREC 1 2017 (Jan. 6, 2017). Specifically, a grant is warranted (1) if the service-connected disability caused the Veteran to become obese, (2) if obesity was a substantial factor in causing a subsequent disability, and (3) if the subsequent disability would not have occurred but for obesity. Id. Indirect secondary service connection is also warranted where obesity aggravates the claimed disability. Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020).

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension 

The Veteran now seeks service connection for his hypertension as due to his service-connected left knee disability, to include obesity as an intermediate step.  

Preliminarily, the Board notes that under the AMA only pre-decisional duty to assist errors are eligible for remand.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  However, in this case, there is no pre-decisional duty to assist error associated with the August 2019 RO's failure to obtain a secondary medical opinion on this reasonably raised theory given that the Veteran was not yet service-connected for a left knee disability.  Furthermore, even if the Board was permitted by the AMA to remand for an addendum opinion under these circumstances, it is not allowed to do so in order to obtain potentially negative evidence.  Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305 (2003).  Accordingly, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and awards service connection on a secondary basis.

The Veteran is diagnosed with hypertension and service-connected for a left knee disability.  As such, the remaining question is whether they are related, to include obesity as an intermediate step.

The joint motion directed the Board to the following evidence: [1] a January 2017 treatment record indicating that the Veteran had recently gained weight, that he is currently obese, exercise is linked to weight loss, and that his physician had discussed the importance of the "need for...increased exercise to achieve weight loss which would help control his...hypertension," [2] February 2018 treatment records showing that the Veteran's blood pressure would be "better controlled" if he were to lose weight and that he was then counseled for the need for "increased exercise," and [3] a July 2019 VA examination showing that the Veteran's left knee disability "prevent[s] exercising" and limits his ability to walk and stand."  

Taking these favorable items together and generously resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that his?hypertension is related to his service-connected left knee disability via?obesity?as an intermediary step. The medical evidence cited above sufficiently connects the Veteran's service-connected left knee disability to a failure to exercise, connects a failure to exercise to resultant obesity, and connects said obesity to aggravation-i.e., lack of "control"-of his hypertension.  This medical information when read together meets the criteria of VA Gen. Coun. Prec. 1-2017 (Jan. 6, 2017) and Walsh v. Wilkie,?32?Vet. App.?300?(2020). 

Accordingly, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for?hypertension is warranted and the Veteran's appeal is granted.?38 U.S.C. § 5107(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.102. As the claim is granted, no further discussion is necessary.
