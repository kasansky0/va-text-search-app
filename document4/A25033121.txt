DOCKET NO. 231015-385963
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with unspecified depressive disorder and alcohol use disorder in remission due to MST is dismissed as untimely filed. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for tinnitus is dismissed as untimely filed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD was established in a rating decision issued on June 24, 2020, and the most recent change in the evaluation for this condition was established in a rating decision issued on June 30, 2020; the Veteran did not appeal or otherwise request a review of the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date within one year of either of these decisions.

2. The effective date for the award of service connection for tinnitus was established in a rating decision issued on August 25, 2016; the Veteran did not appeal or otherwise request a review of the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date within one year of this decision.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The appeal for entitlement of an earlier effective date for PTSD is not valid and is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.

2. The appeal for entitlement of an earlier effective date for tinnitus is not valid and is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Navy from May 1985 to April 1988.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

In the Veteran's October 2023 VA Form 10182 the Veteran stated he was appealing the specific issues of "PTSD-MST effective date incorrect", "tinnitus effective date incorrect", and "I.U. effective date". The Veteran listed October 19, 2022, as the date of decision. Initially, at the time of the October 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran was not and never was awarded entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (commonly abbreviated as I.U.). Accordingly, the Board finds that the issue of "I.U. effective date" is not on appeal and will not be addressed herein.

Furthermore, the October 2022 rating decision did not establish or assign effective dates for service connection for PTSD-MST and tinnitus. The effective date for tinnitus was assigned in an August 2016 rating decision and the effective date for PTSD was assigned in a June 2020 rating decision. Accordingly, this matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2016 rating decision and a June 2020 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

The Veteran also has another separate Appeal Modernization Act (AMA) appeal pending, docket number 240330-429304, for entitlement to an increase in evaluation of his service-connected PTSD, service connection for erectile dysfunction, entitlement to special monthly compensation, and entitlement to I.U. This appeal will be addressed in a separate decision, according to its place in docket order.

1. Effective Date PTSD.  

2. Effective Date Tinnitus.

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an original award of direct service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

The phrase "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation. However, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has interpreted it as, the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, as determined on a "facts found" basis. See 38 U.S.C § 5110 (a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). As such, an effective date generally can be no earlier than the "facts found;" and "these 'facts found' include the date the disability first manifested" as well as "the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation." See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 51 (2011) (citing 38 U.S.C § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400). Thus, were a veteran to file a claim for benefits before "he actually had the disability," the effective date for the benefits sought would be no earlier than the date his disability first manifested (or the date entitlement arose if it is after the date the claim was filed). See DeLisio, 25 Vet. App at 52 (citations omitted); see also Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. The Board may also dismiss any case over which it determines it does not have jurisdiction, in accordance with due process. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104 (c), 20.202(f) and (g).

In general, a claimant or his representative must file a notice of disagreement with a determination by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the determination. Otherwise, that determination will become final, and the claim shall not thereafter be readjudicated or allowed, except as otherwise provided by law. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

Regarding tinnitus, an August 2016 rating decision granted service connection for tinnitus and assigned an effective date of August 12, 2016, the date of the Veteran's claim. The AOJ mailed notice of the August 2016 rating decision on August 29, 2016. The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and no other new and material evidence was received within the one-year period. This decision became final. Id.

Regarding PTSD, a June 2020 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD and assigned an effective date of February 15, 2017, the date of the Veteran's claim. The AOJ mailed notice of the June 2020 rating decision on June 25, 2020. A subsequent, June 30, 2020, rating decision awarded a temporary higher rating effective January 6, 2020, and a lower rating effective March 1, 2020. The AOJ mailed notice of the June 30, 2020, rating decision on July 1, 2020. The Veteran did not appeal either decision nor was any new and relevant evidence received within the applicable appeal period. These decisions became final. Id.

Based on the foregoing, the Veteran's October 2023 VA Form 10182 appealing the effective date for Tinnitus and PTSD is not timely. Where a VA Form 10182 is not timely filed, the Board may grant an extension of the time to file and accept the VA Form 10182 as timely filed where good cause has been shown. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203 (c). Here, however, the Veteran has not filed a request for an extension of time to file the VA Form 10182. Further, the record does not otherwise show any arguments or statements indicating good cause for the untimely filing. The rating decisions were sent to the Veteran's address of record. Therefore, the Board finds no indication in the record that the Veteran did not timely receive the rating decision or that it was not mailed to his proper address. See, e.g., Fithian v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 146 (2010); Kyhn v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 335 (2010).

In sum, the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was not timely filed, and good cause has not been shown for extending the time to file a VA Form 10182, the appeal is dismissed.
