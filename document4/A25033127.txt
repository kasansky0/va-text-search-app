ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with alcohol use disorder is denied.  

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal, the Veteran's PTSD has been characterized by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, but not total social and occupational impairment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from May 2003 to May 2007. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD is denied.  

The Veteran generally asserts that throughout the appeal his PTSD has been more severe than his currently assigned 70 percent rating and that he is entitled to an increased rating.  

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a 70 percent rating for his PTSD from April 16, 2018.  The period on appeal is from August 2,2023 (the date the Veteran filed an intent to file a claim) plus the one-year lookback period.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); August 2023 Intent to File Letter; September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual disorders in civil occupations.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran's PTSD is currently rated under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.  Ratings are assigned according to the manifestation of particular symptoms.  However, the use of the term "such as" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating.  Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).  Accordingly, the evidence considered in determining the level of impairment under § 4.130 is not restricted to the symptoms provided in the Diagnostic Code.  When determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign for psychiatric disabilities, the Board's "primary consideration" is the Veteran's symptoms.  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 70 percent disability rating applies when occupational and social impairment reflects deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control; spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances; or an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

A 100 percent disability rating is assigned when there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Id.

After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining, including degree of disability, is to be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.  If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the claim is to be denied.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

After a review of the medical and lay evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms do not more nearly approximate a rating of 100 percent as they are not of such a severity or frequency to result in total occupational and social impairment.  In this regard, there is no medical or lay evidence in the record of gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for the names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  

The Board recognizes that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms result in severe social and occupational impairments.  For example, the October 2023 VA examination noted symptoms such as: nightmares; intrusive thoughts; social isolation and avoidance; irritability; problems with concentration; depressed mood; anxiety; panic attacks more than once a week; impaired motivation; impaired judgement; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; and suicidal ideation.  However, the Veteran still retains some social ability as he is able to maintain some relationship with his mother, his ex-wife, and children.  Id.  He also has retained some ability to maintain occupational relationships, as seen in his holding his current employment as a food nutrition assistant.  Id; see also August 2023 VA Treatment Record (VTR).  

Additionally, the October 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran presented with normal grooming and speech processes without any evidence of psychotic symptoms.  These findings are further supported by the Veteran's treatment records from August and December 2022, which noted appropriate dress, grooming, and hygiene along with logical, coherent, and goal directed thought, as well as a lack of audio or visual hallucinations and an absence of suicidal or homicidal ideation.  See August and December 2022 Mental Health Medication Management Notes.

Although the Veteran has reported some passive suicidal ideation during his appeal, this is contemplated in his current 70 percent rating, and there is no evidence that his suicidal ideation has risen to the level of persistent danger of hurting himself or others during the pending appeal.  Indeed, the Veteran reported ot the October 2023 VA examiner that he would never leave his children.

Therefore, a higher, 100 percent rating is not warranted, as the evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran is totally occupationally and socially impaired as a result of the type of symptoms listed in the general rating schedule or symptoms of a similar frequency, severity, and .  Even with a holistic analysis, the Board does not find that the criteria for a 100 percent rating for PTSD are met.  As such, the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for a rating higher than 70 percent for his PTSD and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine therefore does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.  

Here, the Board finds that TDIU has been reasonably raised by the record as part and parcel the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for his PTSD.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  

In an August 2021 letter, the Veteran conveyed that he had requested a reasonable accomodation for his PTSD at his job due to his symptoms, but later lost this job when reasonable accommodations could not be made, which raises the issue of TDIU in the pre-decisional record.  See August 2021 Correspondence.  Moreover, while the Veteran is currently employed, it is not clear if his position is full-time, and he has been given accommodations.  See August 2023 VA outpatient record.  Thus, it is currently unclear as to whether marginal employment and/or work in a protected environment is demonstrated, and this should be clarified on remand in developing the TDIU claim.

This issue is REMANDED for the following action:

Develop and adjudicate the TDIU claim, including requesting that the Veteran complete VA Form 21-8940.
