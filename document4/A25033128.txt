ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an abdominal artery disability, to include as secondary to hypertension, is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's abdominal artery disability is not secondary to service-connected hypertension and is not otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

2. The Veteran's appeal regarding a left shoulder disability was filed over one year after the rating decision was issued by the Regional Office; therefore, the appeal regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for a left shoulder disability is untimely.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for an abdominal artery disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

2. The criteria for a timely appeal with respect to the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Marine Corps from September 1974, until October 1989.

The issues on appeal have previously been before the Board, resulting in remands for additional development. In December 2020, the Board remanded the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability and in November 2022, the Board remanded the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for an abdominal artery disability.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2023, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. However, the Board notes that only the abdominal artery disability was decided in June 2023, while the Veteran's claim of a left shoulder disability was decided in a February 2021, rating decision. The Veteran did not file a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, within one year of the February 2021, rating decision.

In the May 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In addition, service connection for certain chronic diseases, may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271-72 (2015).  Although the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumptive period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).

Additionally, for certain chronic diseases with potential onset during service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Secondary service connection may also be established for a disorder which is aggravated by a service-connected disability; compensation may be provided for the degree of the disability (but only that degree) over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) (2017); Allen v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 374 (1995).

In Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023), the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held 38 U.S.C. § 1110 employs only "but-for" causation in direct and secondary service connection claims. Therefore, a service-connected disability need only be a contributing cause, not the contributing cause, to establish secondary service connection.

1. Entitlement to service connection for an abdominal artery disability, to include as secondary to hypertension, is denied.

The Veteran asserts that his abdominal artery disability is related to his current service-connected hypertension disability.

First, the Board finds that there is evidence of a current disability.  See Wallin, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998); see also Allen, supra.  In June 2019, the Veteran was diagnosed with an ectatic abdominal aorta, which was further verified by the March 2023, VA examination. Therefore, the evidence shows that the Veteran has been diagnosed with an abdominal artery disability. 

Second, the Board finds that there is evidence of a service-connected disability.  See Wallin, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998); see also Allen, supra. The Veteran has been provided a 10 percent rating from October 1989. Therefore, there is no dispute that the Veteran is service connected for hypertension.

Third, the Board finds that there is not medical nexus evidence establishing a connection between the Veteran's service-connected disability and the current disability. 

The Veteran was initially provided a VA examination in June 2019, wherein the examiner did not provide an adequate opinion. The examiner noted that there was a lack of evidence and noted that a January 2019 CT scan was not available, despite it being in the Veteran's file. As a result, the Board remanded to seek an additional medical opinion to review all available evidence.

The Veteran was then afforded a VA examination in March 2023, wherein the examiner concluded that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's abdominal artery disability was caused by the Veteran's service-connected hypertension disability. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's smoking of over 40 years is the most likely cause of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The examiner explained that smoking is the number one risk factor, especially in men. 

The probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion that the physician reaches.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).  Whether a physician provides a basis for a medical opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits.  See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998).  Other factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims folder and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000); Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000).

Here, the March 2023, opinion was provided by a VA medical professional who possesses the necessary education, training, and expertise to provide the requested opinions.  Additionally, the opinion is also shown to have been based on a review of the Veteran's record and is accompanied by a sufficient explanation as to why the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for his claimed abdominal artery disability. Furthermore, there is no competing medical opinion of record.  The Board thus finds that the March 2023, VA opinion is dispositive of the issue at hand.

As to direct service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, the Veteran does not claim, and the record does not show that his abdominal artery is directly due to his military service.  In this regard, a review of the record on appeal does not show the Veteran being diagnosed with an abdominal artery disability while on active duty.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Likewise, the record does not show the Veteran had a problem with an abdominal artery disability in and since service because the record does not reflect a diagnosis until 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether or not discussed in detail. See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal). 

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for an abdominal artery disability is denied.

In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim, the doctrine is not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability is dismissed.

A February 2021, rating decision denied service connection for the Veteran's left shoulder disability.

On March 1, 2021, correspondence, the Veteran was notified of the rating decision denying the claim for service connection for the claimed left shoulder disability.

In a May 2024, VA Form 10182 the Veteran identified the June 2023, rating decision as the date of decision he wished to appeal for his left shoulder disability; however, that decision was not related to the Veteran's claimed left shoulder disability. The last decision issued by the AOJ regarding the Veteran's left shoulder was issued in February 2021 and became final in February 2022.

In this instance, the Veteran's May 2024, VA Form 10182 was not timely filed within one year of a rating decision related to that matter. Under these circumstances, the Board finds as a matter of fact that the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was not timely filed, and as a result, the Board no longer has jurisdiction over this appeal. 

Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability is dismissed.
