REASONS FOR REMAND

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c). 38 U.S.C. § 7101(a)(2).

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from September 1968 to November 1971. 

In January 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ/Regional Office (RO)) issued a decision denying the Appellant's claims on appeal. In the January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Hearing docket. The Board of Veterans' Appeal (Board) notes that the evidentiary window based on the Veteran's selections is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the AOJ issued notice of the applicable decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.

On November 26, 2024, the appellant testified before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) at a Board hearing. The VLJ who conducts a Board hearing in the modernized review system is not required to decide the appeal. Frantzis v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 354 (2022).

If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is remanded.

2. Entitlement to accrued benefits is remanded.

3. Entitlement to nonservice-connected death pension benefits is remanded.

The Appellant is seeking Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits. 

After review of the record, the Board finds that a remand is needed to correct a duty to assist error, when the AOJ failed to determine whether the Appellant is recognized as the Veteran's surviving spouse in the first instance.  

Generally, VA benefits may be paid to the surviving spouse of a veteran if certain requirements are met. These benefits include Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits, a death pension- when the veteran's death is nonservice-connected, and/or any accrued benefits due to the veteran at the time of his death. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1304, 1310, 1311, 1318, 1541. However, establishing status as the veteran's surviving spouse for VA purposes, is a threshold requirement for these benefits. In other words, if the claimant is not recognized as the deceased veteran's surviving spouse in the first instance by the AOJ, there is no entitlement to these benefits.

In this case, the AOJ denied the appellant's claims but failed to determine whether the threshold element of surviving spouse was met. 

Recognition as a surviving spouse is a threshold requirement for death pension (survivor's pension) benefits. The term "surviving spouse" is defined as a person who: (1) was the lawful spouse of a Veteran at the time of the Veteran's death; (2) lived with the Veteran continuously from the date of marriage to the date of the Veteran's death, except where there was a separation which was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, the Veteran without fault of the spouse; and, (3) has not remarried. 38 U.S.C. § 101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b)(1); see Gregory v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 108 (1993); see also VA O.G.C. Prec. Op. No. 3-2014. For VA benefits, marriage means a marriage valid under the law of the place where the parties resided at the time of the marriage, or the law of the place where the parties resided when the right to benefits accrued. 38 U.S.C. § 103(c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(j).

In this case, the AOJ did not make a finding regarding whether the appellant is the surviving spouse. A review of the record illustrates that the appellant and the Veteran were legally married in September 1994, and the Veteran's death certificate lists a Sandra Cobb, presumably now Sandra Davis, as his surviving spouse. Despite that, the AOJ did not make a finding. As such, the DIC claims must be remanded to allow the AOJ to make a finding as to the whether the appellant is considered a surviving spouse in the first instance. Failing to address the threshold element of whether the appellant is considered the surviving spouse of the Veteran equates to the AOJ failing to adjudicate the claim fully on its merits in the first instance.

For these reasons, the DIC claims must be remanded for the AOJ to adjudicate the claim fully on its merits, and to provide the appellant with complete notice of the decision as required by 38 U.S.C. § 5104, including identification of whether or not the DIC claims meets the criteria under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.23, 3.53(a).

On remand, as it pertains to the claim for death pension benefits, the AOJ must solicit the required financial documentation from the appellant, and following readjudication of the claim, provide the appellant with complete notice of the decision as required by 38 U.S.C. § 5104, including identification of whether or not the pension claim meets the criteria under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.23, 3.53(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Perform any and all tasks deemed necessary to develop the DIC claims, to include obtaining required financial documentation from the appellant.

2. Fully adjudicate the claims on appeal, to include making a specific finding of the threshold matter of whether the appellant meets the criteria of a surviving spouse for DIC benefits purposes.
