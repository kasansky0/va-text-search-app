Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 24, 2022, for a separate rating for a left knee recurrent subluxation or instability disability is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 24, 2022, for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, based on permanent and total disability status, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On May 24, 2022, the Veteran filed a valid intent to file (ITF).  On March 14, 2023, the Veteran filed a new claim for increased ratings for left and right knee disabilities.  Concurrently, the Veteran submitted medical evidence documenting lay statements indicating worsening and examination results consistent with an increase in severity compared with earlier evidence.  Separate disability ratings were assigned effective May 24, 2022, based on the date VA received the Veteran's ITF corresponding to the claim for increased rating.  The weight of the evidence of record does not show that worsening occurred prior to the date of that ITF.

2. The Veteran was not permanently and totally disabled due to service-connected disability prior to May 24, 2022.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2014 to August 2021.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Regional Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

On May 30, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 10, 2023, rating decision.  In September 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 10, 2023, rating decision.

In February 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), requesting review of the September 2023 higher-level review rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 10, 2023, AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider that evidence in this decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran wants VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify that evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Dates

The general rule regarding the assignment of effective date for an award based on an original claim for VA benefits is that the effective date shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  One exception to the general rule applies if an application for benefits is received within one year from the date of separation from active service, and an award is made on the basis of that application.  In that limited situation, the effective date of the award is the day following the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  Otherwise, the effective date will be the later of the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Another exception to the general rule regarding assignment of effective date may apply when there is a change in law.  If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of VA within one year from the effective date of the law or VA issue, or at the request of a claimant received within one year from that date, benefits may be authorized from the effective date of the law or VA issue.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

An exception to the general rule is also available for claims for increase where evidence of record shows that an increase in disability occurred within a one-year period preceding receipt of the claim for increase.  An effective date for a claim for increase shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim.  When medical records indicate an increase in a disability, receipt of such medical records may be used to establish effective date(s) for retroactive benefits based on facts found of an increase in a disability only if a complete claim or intent to file a claim for an increase is received within 1 year of the date of the report of examination, hospitalization, or medical treatment.  The provisions of this paragraph apply only when such reports relate to examination or treatment of a disability for which service-connection has previously been established.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

A claimant, a duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of claimant who is not of full age or capacity may indicate a claimant's desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  On receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Earlier effective dates may be warranted for claims that have been continuously pursued.  A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the following administrative review options, as specified, after any decision by the agency of original jurisdiction, Board of Veterans' Appeals, or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, provided that any appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is timely filed as determined by the court:  (1) Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals;  (2) Following notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  (3) Following notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  (4) Following a decision on an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the claimant may file a supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. §3.2500(c).

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. §3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision, provided that any appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must be accepted as timely by that court.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 24, 2022, for a separate rating for a right knee recurrent subluxation or instability disability.

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 24, 2022, for a separate rating for a left knee limitation of extension disability.

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 24, 2022, for a separate rating for a left knee recurrent subluxation or instability disability.

In July 2021, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC.  The Veteran was still on active duty at that time.  In October 2021, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits seeking to establish service connection for, among other disabilities, bilateral knee disabilities.  A December 2021 rating decision established service connection for left and right knee disabilities, rated under Diagnostic Code 5260 for limitation of flexion, and assigned a 10 percent rating for each knee as a minimum disability rating for painful motion under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  The Veteran did not appeal that rating decision.

On May 24, 2022, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC.  On March 14, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits seeking increased ratings for left and right knee disabilities along with medical evidence noting the Veteran's reports of worsening and examination data suggesting a dramatic worsening of symptoms.  A May 10, 2023, rating decision denied increased ratings for bilateral knee disabilities on the basis that a VA examination had been deemed necessary to assess the severity of those disabilities, and the Veteran did not report for the examination.  On May 30, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review seeking review of the May 10, 2023, rating decision.  The September 2023 higher-level rating decision on appeal established separate ratings for left and right knee disabilities representing increased ratings for those knee disabilities, and assigned a May 24, 2022, effective date for those separate ratings based upon receipt of a valid ITF and subsequent receipt within a year of the claim for increased rating due to worsening.  

The Veteran contends that the separate knee disability ratings should have an effective date of August 3, 2021, the day the Veteran separated from active duty.  The Veteran argues that the knee disabilities have been continuously pursued and therefore the earlier effective date is warranted.

After review of the available evidence, the Board disagrees that any earlier effective dates are warranted.

At a November 2021 VA examination, the Veteran was estimated to have, at worst, after repeated use over time, a flexion endpoint at 90 degrees and an extension endpoint at 0 degrees for both knees.  The Veteran had full range of motion with active and passive motion.  Pain was also observed during weight-bearing and active motion, and caused functional loss by preventing aggressive condition, running, and prolonged standing.  The examiner found that the Veteran had no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, recurrent subluxation or persistent instability, patellar instability, or meniscal conditions of either knee, and did not require a prescription for an assistive device such as a cane, walker, crutches, or braces, and did not have any tibial or fibular impairment of either knee.  The Veteran denied any history of surgery or use of any assistive device and denied experiencing flare-ups beyond anything covered by repeated use over time.

In a January 2023 private examination, the Veteran's range of motion endpoints were estimated to be, at worst, during a flare-up or after repeated use over time, 45 degrees for flexion and 20 degrees for extension bilaterally.  The Veteran reported experiencing flare-ups every day, but the examiner indicated that the Veteran was not experiencing a flare-up during examination.  The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy, ankylosis, recurrent patellar dislocation or any tibial or fibular impairment, meniscal conditions, and did not use any other assistive device aside from the brace or braces listed as prescribed to the Veteran.  The examiner found that the Veteran had recurrent subluxation or persistent instability requiring a prescription by a medical provider for a brace, but without a ligament tear or sprain.  The examiner also found recurrent patellar instability but no history of surgery for that or any other knee disability.

The Board has summarized the two primary knee examinations of record.  Those examination reports appear to document dramatically different levels of severity.  The AOJ found that a VA examination was necessary to reconcile the conflicting medical evidence and scheduled an examination.  The Veteran refused to attend the scheduled VA examination and insisted that the private examination report be used without further medical investigation.  The May 10, 2023, rating decision denied an increase on the basis that the Veteran would not report to a VA medical examination deemed necessary.  The September 2023 higher-level review rating decision on appeal granted increased ratings based on the private examination results, but did not discuss the conflicting medical evidence or why it was determined that the scheduled VA examination was not necessary.

The Board finds that the Veteran's March 14, 2023, claim for increase represents a new claim for increased rating on the basis of worsening rather than a supplemental claim or any sort of review of a previous rating decision.  Concurrently with that claim, the Veteran submitted a private examination report noting the Veteran's reports of worsening and documenting more severe symptoms compared with the previous examination of record.  The Board notes that the Veteran did not select any of the available review options such as supplemental claim, higher-level review, or appeal to the Board and instead filed the claim for increase on a new claim form.  The Veteran also did not express any intent to have the previous decision reviewed.

The Board has considered whether the Veteran's claim for increase could be interpreted as any type of appeal or decision review request, and concludes that it cannot.  If a rating decision establishing service connection for a disability and assigning less than a 100 percent disability rating is considered to be a denial, and then a claim for increase based on worsening of that disability is considered to be some manner of appeal or request for review of the previous rating decision, then claims for increase would cease to exist as a class because such claim would necessarily be an appeal or request for review a previous rating.  The Board finds that the weight of the evidence shows that the Veteran's March 14, 2023, claim was a new claim for increased rating, and a claim for increase is not one of the administrative review options that preserves continuous pursuit of a particular issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

The January 2023 private examination provides evidence of worsening as of that examination, but the August 3, 2021, effective date already in place based upon the ITF is earlier than that examination.  The Board finds that other medical evidence does not establish that worsening occurred in the one-year prior to receipt of the Veteran's August 3, 2021, ITF.  The Board finds that the medical evidence of record does not support an earlier effective date on the basis of worsening prior to receipt of the Veteran's ITF.

The Board finds that continuous pursuit for the separate knee ratings does not trace back to the Veteran's original October 2021 claim for service connection.  Instead, those separate ratings represent an increase rating originating from the March 14, 2023, claim for increase and therefore have been continuously pursued from the date of the August 3, 2021, ITF associated with that claim, but not earlier.

Additionally, the Board finds that even if those separate ratings were considered to have been continuously pursued since the original October 2021 claim, it does not follow that the separate ratings should be extended back to the day following the Veteran's separation because that the evidence shows that those disabilities or at least the symptoms warranting those separate ratings were not present at that time.  Consequently, it cannot be said that entitlement arose prior to May 24, 2022, even if continuous pursuit were to be found.  The Board notes that the Veteran contends that an earlier effective date is warranted due to continuous pursuit and that bilateral knee disabilities were present since service.  However, the Veteran does not contend that the severe symptoms documented on the January 2023 private examination report were present at the time of separation or prior to August 3, 2021.  Continuous pursuit, as considered by the applicable regulations, exists to preserve effective date rights during the potentially lengthy process of appeal or other review of AOJ decisions.  

The Board has considered a scenario where claims for increase supported continuous pursuit.  If increased disability ratings were applied retroactively back to the original effective date of service connection regardless of the actual severity of any disability as shown by contemporaneous evidence, an absurd and untenable outcome would result.  Effectively, any chronic disability tending to worsen with age or time would warrant progressively higher retroactive ratings if a veteran were to diligently file a claim for increase at least yearly to preserve continuous pursuit.  That result does not comport with the regulatory and statutory system of disability ratings.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim for an earlier effective date for service connection and separate ratings for bilateral knee limitation of extension and recurrent subluxation or instability disabilities.  The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran.  Therefore, the appeal must be denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 24, 2022, for dependents' educational assistance (DEA) based on permanent and total disability status.

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for permanent and total disability status, which the Board has interpreted as an assertion that an earlier effective date for DEA, based on a finding of permanent and total service-connected disability, is warranted.

An eligible person for basic educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 for DEA is a child of a Veteran who has a total disability permanent in nature resulting from a service-connected disability.  Permanent and total means permanent and total disability, permanent and totally disabled, or permanent and total rating, when any of those terms are used in reference to a veteran with a service-connected disability rating determined by VA to be total for the purposes of VA disability compensation where the impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled veteran.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3512; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.3021, 21.3041.

The Veteran's combined disability rating was 90 percent prior to May 24, 2022.  The Veteran was not rated totally disabled prior to May 24, 2022, and cannot be considered permanently and totally disabled during that time period.

Accordingly, entitlement to an effective date prior to May 24, 2022, for permanent and total service-connected disability must be denied, as there is no statutory or regulatory provision that permits the assignment of an earlier effective date for DEA where the Veteran was not rated totally disabled.  Prior to May 24, 2022, the Veteran did not have a total rating for service-connected compensation and therefore could not be considered permanently and totally disabled.  The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran.  Therefore, basic eligibility for DEA cannot be found prior to April 15, 2021, and the claim must be denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
