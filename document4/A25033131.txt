DOCKET NO. 210528-163117
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The matter of whether a waiver is warranted for the overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits in the amount of $4,860.81 is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In September 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force from June 1980 to October 2002. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2020 Decision on Waiver of Indebtedness by the VA Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in May 2021. In September 2024, the Veteran wrote to the Board and indicated he wished to cancel this appeal because the matter had been resolved to his satisfaction. Another similar statement was submitted in November 2024.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In this case, the Veteran has clearly withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
