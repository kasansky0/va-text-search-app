REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1996 to September 2000.  

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2022 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In an October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

With regard to the claims denied herein, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims for increased ratings for his right and left knee disabilities, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Effective Dates

The effective date of an award of service connection will be the day following the date of separation from service if the veteran filed a claim within one year after service. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a), (b)(1). For an award based on an original claim, claim reopened after a final disallowance, or claim for an increased rating, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

An exception to that rule applies, however, where the evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation or notice of intent. If an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to date of receipt of the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." If the increase occurred more than one year prior to date of receipt of the claim, the increase is effective the date of receipt of the claim. If the increase occurred after the date of receipt of the claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1)(2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998).

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 20, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to a 50 percent rating for bilateral pes planus.

A November 2019 rating decision increased the Veteran's rating from 0 percent to 10 percent effective September 16, 2019.  That rating decision was not appealed within one year and became final.  

The Veteran filed an Intent to File on July 20, 2021, followed by a Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ, within one year on June 20, 2022.  

The earliest possible effective date for the 50 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus is July 20, 2020, up to one year prior to the date of the Fully Developed Claim.  However, no evidence indicates that the Veteran's bilateral pes planus worsened, and no evidence otherwise supports an increase in the rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus in the year prior to July 20, 2021. Accordingly, July 20, 2021, is the proper effective date for the grant of the 50 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected pes planus.

For the reasons and bases stated above, the Board finds that an effective date prior to July 20, 2021, is not warranted for the grant of the 50 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus. In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 20, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to a 30 percent rating for left orbital fracture.

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 20, 2021, for the grant of service connection for a left superior orbital rim scar.

In a March 2020 rating decision, the Veteran's noncompensable rating for his service-connected left orbital fracture was continued.  The Veteran did not appeal the March 2020 rating decision within one year and it became final.  

The Veteran filed an Intent to File on July 20, 2021, followed by a Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ, within one year on June 20, 2022.  

The earliest possible effective date for the grant of the 30 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected left orbital fracture is July 20, 2020, up to one year prior to the date of the Intent to File.  However, no evidence indicates that the Veteran's left orbital rim fracture worsened, and no evidence otherwise supports an increase in the rating for the Veteran's service-connected left orbital rim fracture a year prior to July 20, 2021. 

Accordingly, based on the facts of this case, July 20, 2021, is the proper effective date for the grant of the 30 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected orbital rim fracture.  Likewise, July 20, 2021, is the earliest possible effective date for the grant of service connection for the Veteran's left orbital rim scar as no communication prior to July 20, 2021, could be considered a claim for a left orbital rim scar. Accordingly, entitlement to earlier effective dates for the 30 percent rating for Veteran's left orbital rim fracture and service connection for the left orbital rim scar are denied.

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 16, 2000, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for left knee chondromalacia of the patella with instability and shin splints.

5. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 16, 2000, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for right knee chondromalacia of the patella with instability and shin splints.

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran has been awarded service connection for right and left knee chondromalacia of the patella effective September 16, 2000, the day following his separation from active service.  

On his October 2022 VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated that he was appealing the effective date and disability evaluation for his right and left knee chondromalacia which were then assigned noncompensable ratings.  The Board is remanding the increased rating claims below.  It appears that the Veteran may instead be requesting an earliest effective date for any increased rating awarded.  However, since no compensable rating has been awarded for the period on appeal at this time, the effective date of any increased rating would be a downstream issue which cannot be granted at this time.  Moreover, to the extent that the Veteran is requesting earlier effective dates for increased ratings subsequently awarded in the subsequent May 2023 or November 2024 rating decisions, those decisions were required to be appealed separate from the current appeal addressed herein.

To the extent that the Veteran is appealing the effective date of his award of service connection for left and right knee disabilities, the Board emphasizes that the Veteran is already in receipt of the earliest possible date for an award of service connection, the day following his separation from active service.

Moreover, to the extent that the Veteran is requesting an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for his bilateral knee disabilities, such claim must be denied because the February 2002 rating decision granting service connection for his knee disabilities has long been final.  In Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299-300 (2006), the Court held that once a decision that establishes an effective date becomes final, the only way that such a decision can be revised is if it contains clear and unmistakable error. The Court held that appellants are prohibited from collaterally attacking a prior final decision by filing a freestanding earlier effective date claim. The Court specifically held that, once a decision has become final, a claimant may not properly file, and VA has no authority to adjudicate, a freestanding earlier effective date claim in an attempt to overcome the finality of a decision. The Court reasoned that to allow such claims would vitiate the rule of finality. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299. The Court held that if a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date is raised, an appeal in the matter should be dismissed. Thus, the Board is required to dismiss freestanding claims for entitlement to earlier effective dates. Id.; see also DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52 (2006) (stating there is no such procedure as a freestanding challenge to the finality of a VA decision). In other words, if there is disagreement as to the effective date assigned in a given rating action, it must be timely appealed (within one year of notice of the rating decision assigning the effective date).

Accordingly, the Veteran's request for an earlier effective date for his service-connected right and left knee disabilities is dismissed.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by the application of the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities, which are based, as far as practically can be determined, on average impairment in earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When rating a service-connected disability, the entire history must be borne in mind. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). The Board will also consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In view of the number of atypical instances it is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified. Findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom, and above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will, however, be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. At the time of an initial rating, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

The Board notes that it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record.  Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims.  See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

6. From July 20, 2021, to July 16, 2024, entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's service-connected left orbital fracture

The Veteran is currently rated at 30 percent disabling for his service-connected left orbital fracture. While this claim was being developed and adjudicated, the Veteran filed another claim for increased ratings on July 16, 2024.  Accordingly, the appellate period before is from July 20, 2021, to July 16, 2024.

The Veteran's left eye orbital fracture is currently rated at 30 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 6009-6066. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the specific basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown as a hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. In the present case, the Veteran is rated under Diagnostic Code 6009 for unhealed eye injury on the basis of Diagnostic Code 6066 for impairment of central visual acuity for his left eye orbital fracture. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

Unless otherwise directed, diseases of the eye are evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Codes 6000 through 6009. Impairment of Visual Acuity is rated under Diagnostic Codes 6061 through 6066. Impairment of Visual Fields is rated under Diagnostic Codes 6080 through 6081. Impairment of Muscle Function is rated under Diagnostic Codes 6090 through 6091.

The Board notes that the Veteran does not assert, nor does the evidence reflect that the Veteran's service-connected eye disabilities produce incapacitating episodes. Therefore, the Board shall evaluate the Veteran's service-connected eye disabilities based upon visual impairment(s).

The evaluation for visual impairment of one eye must not exceed 30 percent unless there is anatomical loss of the eye. 38 C.F.R. § 4.75(d). Evaluation for visual impairment of one eye shall be combined with evaluation for other disabilities of the same eye that are not based on visual impairment (e.g., disfigurement under diagnostic code 7800). Id. Subject to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.383 (a), if visual impairment of only one eye is service connected, the visual acuity of the other eye will be considered to be 20/40 for purposes of evaluating the service-connected visual impairment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.75(c). 38 C.F.R. § 3.383(a) provides that compensation is payable for the combination of service-connected and nonservice-connected disabilities when the impairment of vision in each eye is rated at a (corrected distance) visual acuity of 20/200 or less; or the peripheral field of vision for each eye is 20 degrees or less.

During the period on appeal, the Veteran was rated at 30 percent disabling for his service-connected left eye orbital fracture.  The diagnostic code provides that evaluation for visual impairment of one eye must not exceed 30 percent unless there is anatomical loss of the eye. 38 C.F.R. § 4.75 (d).  The Veteran has not been awarded service connection for any right eye disabilities.  In addition, no evidence indicates that the Veteran had anatomical loss of his left eye.  See July 2022 VA examiner's report.  Accordingly, the Veteran is in receipt of the highest possible schedular rating absent a service-connected right eye disability or anatomical loss of his left eye.  The Veteran has not provided any argument explaining why he would be entitled to a rating in excess of the schedular maximum.

For the reasons and bases stated above, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's service-connected left eye orbital fracture nor are any additional, separate ratings. In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable.

7. From July 20, 2021, to July 16, 2024, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected left orbital rim scar.

The Veteran's left eye orbital rim scar is currently rated 10 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 7800, for disfigurement of the head, face, or neck. Under certain circumstances, as is the case here, ratings may be warranted for scarring associated with an eye disability.

Under Diagnostic Code 7800, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a scar with one characteristic of disfigurement. A 30 percent rating is warranted for a scar with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or with two or three characteristics of disfigurement. Note (1) to Diagnostic Code 7800 identifies the eight characteristics of disfigurement: a scar 5 or more inches in length; a scar at least one-quarter inch wide at widest part; surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation; scar adherent to underlying tissue; skin hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches; skin texture abnormal in an area exceeding six square inches; underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding six square inches; and, skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches.

Here, no evidence indicates that the Veteran's left eye orbital rim scar was manifested by visible or palpable tissue loss, distortion of asymmetry of his eyes (including eye lids), or two or three characteristics of disfigurement.  Here, the Veteran had no characteristics of disfigurement.  His scar was only of 6 centimeters, not 5 or more inches, in length.  In addition, his scar was only .1 centimeter in width, not at least one-quarter inch wide at the widest part of the scar.  The surface contour of the scar was not elevated or depressed on palpation, it was not adherent to underlying tissue, he did not have a hypo- or hyper-pigmented area exceeding six square inches, he did not have abnormal skin texture in an area exceeding six square inches, and his skin was not indurated or inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches.  See July 2022 VA examiner's report.  The Veteran's only symptoms were pain, including tenderness to palpation, which alone do not support a higher, 30 percent rating.  Id.

For the reasons and bases stated above, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's service-connected left eye orbital rim scar nor are any additional, separate ratings. In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable.

8. From July 20, 2021, to March 20, 2023, entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus

The Veteran contends that his 10 percent rating does not adequately reflect the impairment caused by his service-connected tinnitus.  The Veteran stated in his October 2022 VA Form 10182 that he has massive ringing and hearing issues.  In a June 2022 buddy statement from L.C.S., the Veteran's buddy stated: "A couple of years ago, I started noticing he was having problems hearing.  I remember on one occasion, I had to ask questions multiple times, repeat things, and use paper to communicate with him.  It was also around that time, he started complaining about a constant ringing in his ear that caused him to sleep with the television on, just so he could get some rest but most nights he wasn't able to get any sleep."  The Board emphasizes that the Veteran has not been awarded service connection for right or left ear hearing loss and was previously denied entitlement to service connection for hearing loss.

The Veteran's tinnitus is currently assigned a 10 percent evaluation pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260 (recurrent tinnitus). Thus, the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus has been assigned the maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus of 10 percent under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260.

The Board also finds that extraschedular consideration is not warranted in this case.  Consideration of an extraschedular rating requires a three-step inquiry. The first question is whether the schedular rating criteria adequately contemplate the veteran's disability picture. If the schedular evaluation does not contemplate the level of disability and symptomatology shown and is found inadequate, then the second inquiry is whether the exceptional disability picture exhibits other related factors, such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization. See Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008). The first Thun element compares a claimant's symptoms to the rating criteria, while the second addresses the resulting effects of those symptoms. Thus, the first and second Thun elements, although interrelated, involve separate and distinct analyses. Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 495 (2016). If the veteran's disability picture meets the second inquiry, then the third step is to refer the case to the Director of Compensation Services to determine whether an extraschedular rating is warranted. See Thun, 22 Vet. App. 111.

Here, Diagnostic Code 6260 clearly contemplates the Veteran's reported symptoms of ringing in his ears, even constant ringing. In addition, the Board emphasizes that the Veteran was previously denied service connection for hearing loss and entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is not an issue that is before the Board at this time.

For the reasons and bases stated above, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus. In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. From July 20, 2021, to March 20, 2023, entitlement to a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected left knee disability.

2. From July 20, 2021, to March 20, 2023, entitlement to a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected right knee disability.

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran filed a Notice of Intent to File on July 20, 2021, followed by a Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ, within one year on June 20, 2022.  While this claim was being developed or adjudicated, the Veteran filed subsequent claims requesting increased ratings for his right and left knee disabilities on March 20, 2023, and July 16, 2024.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the relevant appellate period for the present claim is from July 20, 2021, to March 20, 2023.

First, the Board notes that remand is required to obtain actual or estimated range of motion measurements for the Veteran's left and right knees for the period from July 20, 2021, to March 20, 2023.  The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2022.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's knees flexed to gravity while sitting but did not allow active or passive flexion to be completed while lying.  Accordingly, the VA examiner was unable to establish a baseline range of motion for each of the Veteran's knees.  However, the record is unclear whether the failure to obtain range of motion measurements for the Veteran's knees was the result of the Veteran's refusal to participate in range of motion testing or his physical inability to do so.  In addition, the VA examiner did not address whether estimated range of motion measurements were able to be obtained by other means such as interviewing the Veteran.  Accordingly, the Board finds that remand is required to obtain estimated ranges of motion for the Veteran's right and left knees.  The Board notes that an inadequate VA examination is a predecisional duty to assist error.  

In addition, the Board also advises the Veteran that the duty to assist a claimant is not a one-way street.  The Veteran is required to cooperate fully in the development of his claim.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). A veteran must cooperate when he is asked for information that is essential in obtaining the evidence to substantiate his claim. See Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171 (2005).  Accordingly, the Veteran must assist to the full extent possible in providing range of motion measurements for his knees.

The Board also notes that a review of the record reveals the Veteran takes medication for his service-connected right and left knee disabilities. See July 2022 VA examiner's report.  Specifically, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran took over-the-counter medications and used icy/hot, lidocaine, and a knee brace for treatment of his knee disabilities.  As the applicable diagnostic codes and special musculoskeletal regulations do not reference medication, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects when assigning an evaluation. See Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025).  Here, the medical evidence of record is inadequate to the extent it is unclear whether the ameliorative effects of such medication, if any, were discounted in determining the severity of the Veteran's service-connected right and left knee disabilities. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012). As such, a remand is necessary to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of the Veteran's service-connected right and left knee disabilities.  An examination should only be scheduled if the clinician deems one is necessary to provide the requested opinions. 

a). The VA examiner should provide actual or estimated range of motion measurements for the Veteran's right and left knees for the period from July 20, 2021, to March 20, 2023.

If the VA examiner is not able to provide actual or estimate range of motion measurements, the VA examiner should explain why such measurements cannot be provided.

b). The examiner should indicate whether any medications used by the Veteran are productive of ameliorative effects on the service-connected right or left knee disabilities. 

c). If so, the examiner must identify each medication and clearly explain what the Veteran's symptoms and ranges of motions would be without the medication in all relevant measurements, to include during flare-ups or with repeated use over time.

c). In so opining the examiner should consider the lay and medical evidence of record.

A rationale for all opinions must be provided. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain why an opinion cannot be provided (e.g., lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).
