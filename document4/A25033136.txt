ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability evaluation based upon individual unemployability prior to April 1, 2021, is denied.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on housebound status for the period prior to January 27, 2022, is granted in part, effective as of April 1, 2021.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the period prior to April 1, 2021, the evidence of record has not established that the Veteran has been rendered incapable of securing or maintaining a substantially gainfully occupation.

2. Resolving all doubt in his favor, the Veteran had a single disability rated at 100 percent or total, and his entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) was based on more than one service-connected disability from April 1, 2021.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for establishing entitlement to a total disability evaluation based upon individual unemployability prior to April 1, 2021, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411. 

2. The criteria for establishing entitlement to special monthly compensation based on housebound status from April 1, 2021, has been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Army from July 2000 to October 2005.

Review of the record indicates that the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application in January 2022.  On the same date, he also filed VA Form 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.

Pursuant to a May 2022 Rating Decision, the assigned evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD was increased from 50 percent disabling to 100 disabling from February 5, 2022.  That date corresponds with favorable VA examination findings of an increase in symptomology. The rating office (RO) decision also determined that the Veteran's claim of entitlement to special monthly compensation based on housebound criteria had been shown from February 5, 2022, forward.  His claim for a TDIU was deemed moot.

In February 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.  Therein, he requested an earlier effective date for the award of TDIU and SMC. The Veteran also alleged entitlement to an increased rating and earlier effective date for his service-connected PTSD. On the same date, Counsel submitted additional arguments in support of the Veteran's claims.

Pursuant to a May 2023 Rating Decision, the assigned evaluation for the Veteran's PTSD was increased to 100 percent disabling from January 27, 2022. An evaluation of 70 percent disabling was established effective September 30, 2010. That decision also awarded an earlier effective date of April 1, 2021, for the award of a TDIU.  An earlier effective date of January 27, 2022, was awarded for the grant of SMC. 

In April 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Board of Veterans' Appeals. Attached thereto, Counsel submitted additional arguments in support of the Veteran's claims.

Given the above, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Earlier Effective Dates - Generally

In general, the effective date of an award of compensation and rating based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a) (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (2020).  When evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation, the effective date of the award shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if application is received within one year from that date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2) (2014); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2) (2020); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

As applicable in this appeal, a "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p).  Any communication indicating an intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

1. Entitlement to a total disability evaluation based upon individual unemployability prior to April 1, 2021 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to April 1, 2021, for the award of a TDIU. As discussed in further detail below, the evidence weighs pervasively against his claim.

In general, a TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3)disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table). 

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Id. Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id.

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

Review of the record indicates that the Veteran has been granted service connection for the following conditions: (1) PTSD, evaluated as 50 percent disabling from October 5, 2005, 70 percent disabling from September 30, 2010, and 100 percent disabling from January 27, 2022; (2) obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), evaluated as 50 percent disabling from June 6, 2007; (3) left upper radiculopathy, lower radicular group associated with cervical strain, evaluated as 20 percent disabling from January 27, 2022; (4) right upper radiculopathy, lower radicular group associated with cervical strain, evaluated as 20 percent disabling from January 27, 2022; (5) right sciatic radiculopathy associated with back strain, chronic (claimed as low back disability), evaluated as 20 percent disabling from January 27, 2022; (6) tinnitus, right ear, evaluated as 10 percent disabling from November 27, 2006; (7) cervical strain, evaluated as non-compensable from December 8, 2006, and 10 percent disabling from September 30, 2007; (8) back strain, evaluated as non-compensable from October 22, 2005; and 10 percent disabling from January 27, 2022; (9) pseudofolliculitis to include tinea versicolor, evaluated as non-compensable from November 27, 2006, 30 percent disabling from September 30, 2010, and non-compensable from May 1, 2021; and (10) erectile dysfunction associated with PTSD with generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, single episode, with psychotic features, evaluated as non-compensable from January 27, 2022.

The combined schedular evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities was evaluated as 80 percent disabling from June 6, 2007, 90 percent disabling from September 30, 2010, and 100 percent disabling from January 27, 2022.

Despite the above, the Board must also determine whether the Veteran was rendered unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities for the period prior to April 1, 2021.

As discussed in more detail below, the Board concludes that the evidence does not support a basis of entitlement to a TDIU prior to April 1, 2021.

Review of the record indicates that the Veteran filed VA Form 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, in January 2022. Therein, he stated that he last worked full time in March 2021 as an operations supervisor with CVS pharmacy.  The Veteran relates his inability to work to his service-connected PTSD, sleep apnea, cervical strain, back strain, pseudofolliculitis, and tinea versicolor.  

The same month, the Veteran also filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application.  In an attached lay statement, he reported working as an operations supervisor from January 2020 until March 2021. However, due to increasing anxiety and depression, it became too difficult to work with the public, concentrate on assigned tasks, and complete tasks within the required timelines. Due to poor motivation, the Veteran endorsed a frequent need to take breaks to avoid lashing out. Reportedly, he submitted a resignation letter in March 2021 and has not returned to work since that time.

In February 2022, a VA examination identified current diagnoses of PTSD, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, and a generalized anxiety disorder. Current symptoms included a depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks at least once per week, near continuous panic or depression impacting independent functioning, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, a flattened affect, stereotyped speech, difficultly understanding complex commands, gross impairment of thought processes or communication, disturbances of motivation or mood, difficulty establishing or maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including a work-like setting, an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, suicidal ideations, impaired impulse control, spatial disorientation, persistent delusions or hallucinations, persistent danger of hurting himself or others, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living. Behavioral observations indicate that the Veteran appeared depressed and withdrawn, with slow speech. Other related symptoms included impotence. Based upon the above, the Veteran's symptomology was associated with total occupational and social impairment.

In March 2022, the Veteran's Counsel submitted additional arguments alleging that the Veteran is entitled to an evaluation of 100 percent disabling throughout the appeal period.  Chronic problems with anger, impaired concentration/focus, low motivation, an inability to adapt to stressful situations and relationship impairments were specifically reported.

Pursuant to a May 2023 Rating decision, the RO increased the assigned evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD to 100 percent disabling, effective January 27, 2022. An evaluation of 70 percent disabling was assigned from September 30, 2010. That decision also established entitlement to a TDIU from April 1, 2021.  Entitlement to SMC was established from January 27, 2022.

In April 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  Attached thereto, Counsel submitted additional arguments in support of the Veteran's claim.  Specifically, it was alleged that an earlier effective date is warranted for the Veteran's TDIU and SMC based upon worsening symptoms associated with his PTSD.  Of note, VA has already conceded he has not worked since April 1, 2021.  The award of TDIU has been established from that date.  Counsel suggests that medical evidence credibly establishes that the Veteran suffered functional limitations due to his service-connected PTSD that impaired his ability to perform the activities required to maintain a substantially gainful occupation. In particular, Counsel called attention to medical evidence indicating that the Veteran's PTSD caused impaired memory, concentration, an inability to adapt to change or handle workplace stress, get along with coworkers, or demonstrate reliability or productivity. 

While the Board has fully considered Counsel's arguments and medical evidence indicating that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms produced significant occupational limitations, it cannot ignore other evidence indicating that he maintained full-time employment until March 2021. 

As previously stated, a March 2023 Rating Decision granted the Veteran's claim of entitlement to a TDIU with an assigned effective date of April 1, 2021. That date corresponds with 1 day after he discontinued full-time employment due to his service-connected disabilities, to include PTSD.

Although the Veteran's complaints of occupational impairments for the period prior to April 2021 are acknowledged, the evidence of record fails to establish a basis to assign an earlier effective date as he maintained full-time employment until March 2021.  

Moreover, none of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, to include his PTSD had been evaluated as totally disabling for the period prior to April 1, 2021.  Accordingly, Counsel's argument he was unemployable for the period prior thereto is without merit. 

Accordingly, as the evidence weighs pervasively against his claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (2020). Therefore, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to April 1, 2021, for the award of TDIU must be denied.

2. Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound prior to January 27, 2022.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to January 27, 2022, for the award of SMC at the housebound rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s).

Generally, special monthly compensation at the housebound rate is payable where a Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). Generally, the effective date of a benefit is the date of receipt of the claim or the date that entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Court has determined that 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) does not limit "a service-connected disability rated as total" to only a schedular rating of 100 percent, and that a TDIU rating based on a single disability may satisfy the statutory requirement of a "total rating" for SMC purposes. See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280. However, the Court has also held that a TDIU rating "that is based on multiple underlying disabilities cannot satisfy the section 1114(s) requirement of 'a service-connected disability' because that requirement must be met by a single disability." Buie, 24 Vet. App. at 250 (quoting 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s)(1)). Additionally, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16, although multiple disabilities stemming from the same etiology or affecting the same body part may be considered a single disability for purposes of meeting the threshold requirements of schedular TDIU consideration; this combination of disabilities for meeting schedular requirements of TDIU does not apply to the rating requirement for SMC at the housebound rate. Youngblood v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 412, 415 (2019), aff'd sub nom. Youngblood v. McDonough, 838 F. App'x 566 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In this case, for the period prior to January 27, 2022, the Veteran had been assigned disability evaluations for the following conditions (1) PTSD, evaluated as 50 percent disabling from October 5, 2005 and 70 percent disabling from September 30, 2010; (2) obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), evaluated as rated 50 percent disabling from June 6, 2007; (3) tinnitus, right ear, evaluated as 10 percent disabling from November 27, 2006; (4) cervical strain, evaluated as non-compensable from December 8, 2006, and 10 percent disabling from September 30, 2007; (5) back strain, evaluated as non-compensable from October 22, 2005; and (6) pseudofolliculitis to include tinea versicolor evaluated as non-compensable from November 27, 2006, 30 percent disabling from September 30, 2010, and non-compensable from May 1, 2021.

During the identified period, the combined evaluations for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities reached 80 percent disabling from June 6, 2007, and 90 percent disabling from September 30, 2021.  Of note, he met the schedular criteria for a TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a) from June 6, 2007. 

As previously indicated, the Veteran submitted multiple lay statements suggesting that he was unable to work due to his service-connected disabilities, to include PTSD. In fact, his VA Form 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, dated January 2022, notes that he last worked full time as an operations supervisor with CVS pharmacy in March 2021. 

In February 2022, the VA examiner determined the symptomology associated with the Veteran's service-connected PTSD resulted in total occupational and social impairment.

Based upon the above, the March 2023 Rating decision increased the assigned evaluation of the Veteran's service-connected PTSD to 100 percent disabling effective February 5, 2022. That date correspondence with VA examiner's favorable findings regarding unemployability.

A subsequent rating decision dated May 2023 established entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 27, 2022, for assigned evaluation of 100 percent disabling for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. That date corresponds with the date of receipt of his claim for an increased rating. An evaluation of 70 percent disabling was established from September 30, 2010.   

That decision also established entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 27, 2022, for the award of SMC.  That date corresponds with the initial date upon which a 100 percent rating had been assigned, plus the separate disability rated at least 60 percent disabling-here, the rating increase to 70 percent for PTSD, effective from September 30, 2010.

As stated in section 1, the Board understands Counsel's argument that the Veteran was entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of TDIU and SMC, the evidence credibly establishes that he maintained full-time employment (despite his functional limitations) for the period prior to April 1, 2021. While the Board notes that the Veteran's PTSD has been evaluated as 70 percent disabling for the period prior to April 1, 2021, it notes that by his own admission, the Veteran endorsed working full-time until March 2021.  

Therefore, resolving all doubt in his favor, the Board finds that the record evidence supports the award of an earlier effective date of April 1, 2021, by no earlier. To that limited extent, the Veteran's claim is granted.

Conversely, the Board notes for the period prior to April 1, 2021, only one of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities met the diagnostic criteria for a schedular rating for a TDIU.  The Court has determined that 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) does not limit "a service-connected disability rated as total" to only a schedular rating of 100 percent, and that a TDIU rating based on a single disability may satisfy the statutory requirement of a "total rating" for SMC purposes. See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280.  In this case, the Veteran's PTSD was evaluated as 70 percent disabling from September 30, 2010, forward.  However, for the same period the record evidence suggests that he maintained full-time employment until March 2021.  

(Continued on the next page)

?

As such, the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim and the Board finds it has no basis upon which to grant the effective date sought. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and entitlement to an effective date prior to April 1, 2021, for the award of SMC at the housebound rate is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
