ORDER

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Board issued a decision on October 2, 2024, denying a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD.

2. On October 7, 2024, the Board was notified that the Veteran died in September 2024.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for vacatur of the October 2, 2024 Board decision denying a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

2. Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the appeal for entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD at this time.  38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Navy from April 1989 to April 1992.  The Veteran passed away in September 2024.

In December 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision denying entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD.  In the June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

The Board may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the appellant or his or her representative, or on the Board's own motion, when an appellant has been denied due process of law.  38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

In this case, the Veteran passed away on September 6, 2024, as evidenced by a Social Security Administration death notice received on October 7, 2024.  The death notice was not on file at the time of the issuance of the October 2, 2024 Board decision and was thus not available for review.  Accordingly, the October 2, 2024 Board decision must be vacated because the Veteran died prior to its issuance.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal.  Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim of entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD at this time and must dismiss this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims.  This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b).  Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the Veteran.  Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant."  The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/.  If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the Veteran's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The appeal is dismissed.
