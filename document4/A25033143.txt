ORDER

Entitlement to a higher rating for T4-T5 spinal stenosis (low back disability), under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Legacy appeal for a higher rating for a low back disability remains pending.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to dismiss entitlement to a higher rating for T4-T5 spinal stenosis (low back disability) under the AMA has been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 19.2, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from June 1997 to June 2002.  His decorations include the Parachutist Badge.  

This case is on appeal from an October 2020 rating decision.  

By way of background, a May 2002 rating decision granted a 50 percent rating for the Veteran's status post T5 compression fracture with secondary myofascial pain syndrome (low back disability) with an evaluation of 50 percent effective June 25, 2002, the day following his separation from service.  This grant was based on severe limitation of motion under former Diagnostic Code 5292 and an additional 10 percent added per former Diagnostic Code 5285.

In an October 2017 rating decision, the RO stated, in pertinent part, that a special review of the Veteran's file was mandated on October 30, 2017.  Based on the review and the evidence listed below, the RO decreased the evaluation of status post T5 compression fracture with secondary myofascial pain syndrome (low back disability), from 50 percent disabling to 40 percent disabling, effective February 1, 2018.

The Veteran filed a Legacy notice of disagreement (NOD) in April 2018 with respect to the October 2017 rating decision, which was acknowledged by the RO, but a statement of the case (SOC) was not issued.  Instead, the RO issued another rating decision in February 2020. 

In the February 2020 rating decision, the RO noted that an April 2018 notice of disagreement was received about one or more of our earlier decisions.  The February 2020 rating decision found that a clear and unmistakable error was made in the evaluation of Status post T5 compression fracture with secondary myofascial pain syndrome and a retroactive increased evaluation to 50 percent disabling is re-established from February 1, 2018.  The RO also stated that evaluation of status post T5 compression fracture with secondary myofascial pain syndrome (previously evaluated under diagnostic code 5295), which is currently 50 percent disabling, is proposed to be decreased to 10 percent.

Thereafter, in the October 2020 rating decision on appeal, the RO stated that the rating decision dated February 26, 2020, proposed to reduce service-connected disabilities.  As the due process period expired has expired and based on a review of the evidence listed below, the RO found that the evaluation of T4-T5 spinal stenosis (previously evaluated as status post T5 compression with secondary myofascial pain syndrome), which is currently evaluated 50 percent disabling, is decreased to 20 percent effective January 1, 2021. 

In a September 2021 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed this denial to the Board under the AMA.  

The AMA applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2(b).  The AMA also applies where a claimant has elected review of a Legacy appeal under the AMA where the claimant opts into the AMA under the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) or by electing to proceed under the AMA after the issuance of a SOC.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

A rating decision adjudicating an issue that is the subject of a pending Legacy appeal is not an initial decision to which the AMA applies.  Therefore, it cannot be appealed via a VA Form 10182.  See Hamilton v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 528, 541 (1993) (holding that once a claim is in "appellate status" by virtue of a previously filed NOD, the claimant may not file an additional NOD which could confer jurisdiction on the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) as to that claim); Hudson v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 467, 468 (1992) (where appellant filed a NOD as to an AOJ decision assigning a 30 percent rating, a statement of disagreement with a subsequent AOJ decision awarding a 50 percent rating was not an NOD that would give the CAVC jurisdiction).  Accordingly, if a rating decision issued on or after February 19, 2019, adjudicates an issue that is the subject of an appeal pending in the Legacy system, that decision is not an "initial" decision to which the AMA would apply.

Here, the appeal of entitlement to a higher rating for T4-T5 spinal stenosis (low back disability) under the AMA was still in appellate status based on the April 2018 NOD.  Therefore, since the October 2020 rating decision was issued while the Legacy appeal was pending, and was not an initial decision, the present appeal does not constitute an initial decision to which the AMA applies.  The Legacy appeal has not been opted into RAMP and could not have been opted into the AMA from an SOC because none has been issued.  As such, the AMA does not apply to the October 2020 rating decision and the appeal is considered moot.  

Since there remains no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration regarding this claim, the criteria for the dismissal of this AMA appeal are met.  The Veteran's appeal under the Legacy system is not dismissed and remains active.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.
