DOCKET NO. 241224-504912
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the October 2024 denial of service connection for a right ankle condition is dismissed.

The appeal of the November 2024 denial of service connection for a cannabis use disorder, moderate and alcohol use disorder, mild (claimed and previously rated as insomnia) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In February 2025, the Veteran notified the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) that he intends to withdraw his appeal. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria to withdraw the appeal of the October 2024 denial of service connection for a right ankle condition have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria to withdraw the appeal of the November 2024 denial of service connection for a cannabis use disorder, moderate and alcohol use disorder, mild (claimed and previously rated as insomnia) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from March 1992 to June 2013.

This matter is on appeal from October 2024 and November 2024 rating decisions by a VA Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182 or "NOD") and selected the evidence submission docket. 

In a statement received February 2025 and March 2025, the Veteran explicitly and unambiguously indicated that he wished to withdraw his December 2024 appeal of the October 2024 and November 2024 rating decisions. 

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the issues of service connection for a right ankle disability or cannabis use disorder, moderate and alcohol use disorder, mild (claimed and previously rated as insomnia) and the appeal is dismissed. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
