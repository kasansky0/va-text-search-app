FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes a finding that prior to January 24, 2023, the service-connected coronary artery disease symptoms manifested as a workload equivalent to greater than 5 METs but less than 7 METs.

2. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes a finding that from January 24, 2023, the service-connected coronary artery disease symptoms manifested as a workload equivalent to greater than 3 METs but less than 5 METs.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent prior to January 24, 2023, and in excess of 60 percent thereafter for service-connected coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with stent placement have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.100, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7005-7006.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1989 to August 1992. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2022 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 decision. In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2023 decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the heart claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the remaining claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran styled the issues on the May 2023 HLR as "clear error." It is unclear whether they intended it to be "clear and unmistakable error, (CUE)" or if they were simply expressing disagreement with the assigned ratings and effective dates. The AOJ did not address the issues as CUE. If the Veteran had intended this to be CUE, the Board cannot address CUE in the first instance. The Veteran may resubmit the review request to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending.

Entitlement to an increased rating for service-connected coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with stent placement

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of any disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Although the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings, the Board is to consider the Veteran's medical history in determining the applicability of a higher rating for the entire period in which the appeal has been pending. Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999).

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings). When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed.  Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509.

Here, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim in April 2021, which the AOJ denied in September 2021. In July 2022, the Veteran submitted an HLR, which the AOJ denied in August 2022. And in January 2023, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim. The Veteran submitted each request within one year of the prior decision, which demonstrates continuous pursuit of the claim. Accordingly, the Board will consider evidence from April 2020 until the May 2023 rating decision, which was subject to an HLR.

The Veteran's service-connected CAD is rated under DC 7005-7006, which is evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart.

Effective November 14, 2021, VA revised the criteria for evaluating cardiovascular disorders. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: The Cardiovascular System, 38 C.F.R. § 4.104 (Nov. 14, 2021). VA's General Counsel has held that where a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a claim for a higher rating, the Board must first determine whether the revised version is more favorable to the veteran. In so doing, it may be necessary for the Board to apply both the old and new versions of the regulation. If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the retroactive reach of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. The Board must generally apply both the former and the revised versions of the regulation for the period prior and subsequent to the regulatory change, but an effective date based on the revised criteria may be no earlier than the date of the change.

VA thus must consider the claim for a higher rating pursuant to the former and revised regulations during the latter part of this appeal. See VAOPGCPREC 3 2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 33,422 (2000); DeSousa v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 461, 467 (1997). Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to November 14, 2021, and both the old and new rating criteria from November 14, 2021. The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied.

Prior to November 14, 2021, Under Diagnostic Code 7005, a 30 percent rating under DC 7005 is not warranted unless METs testing shows the Veteran develops dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope at a workload greater than 5 METs but not greater than 7 METs, or; alternatively, evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray. A 60 percent rating is not warranted unless there is more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year, or; workload of greater than 3 METs but not greater than 5 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30 to 50 percent. For the purposes of a 60 percent evaluation, the rating criteria do not require a separate showing of left ventricular dysfunction in addition to an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent. Otero-Castro v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 375, 382 (2002).

One metabolic equivalent (MET) is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2). When the level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope may be used. Id. 

From November 14, 2021, the Veteran's service-connected heart disability may be rated under the General Formula. A 30 percent rating contemplates a workload of greater than 5 METs, but not greater than 7 METs, which results in heart failure symptoms, or evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation on echocardiogram or equivalent. A 60 percent rating contemplates a workload of greater than 3 METs, but not greater than 5 METs, which results in heart failure symptoms. A 100 percent rating contemplates a workload of 3 METs or less, resulting in heart failure symptoms. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, General Rating Formula.

Evidence

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2021 where he reported that the condition had stayed the same since its onset and manifested as intermittent chest pain. The examiner noted that there was no pain on examination, and that treatment included a stent, and medication. The ejection fraction was 65 percent. The examination consisted of an interview based METs test, where the Veteran described dyspnea, and fatigue, which equated to greater than 3 METs, but not greater than 5 METs. The examiner indicated that the METs was not solely due to the cardiac condition, and that it was also related to knee pain. They opined that without the knee pain, the METs is more accurately reflected at greater than 5 METs, but not greater than 7 METs, which was consistent with walking one flight of stairs, golfing, mowing the lawn, and heavy yard work. The examiner found that there was no functional impact.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in February 2023 where he reported intermittent chest pain, which was chronic, atypical, and unrelated to exertion. The ejection fraction was 60 percent. The examination consisted of an interview based METs test, where the Veteran described dyspnea, and fatigue, which equated to greater than 3 METs, but not greater than 5 METs, based on breathlessness, and fatigue, which was solely due to the heart condition. The examiner found functional impact, to include shortness of breath with exertion, fatigue, and occasional chest pain.

Analysis

Based on the aforementioned, the Board finds that prior to January 24, 2023, the service-connected coronary artery disease is appropriately assigned a 30 percent evaluation based on a workload of greater than 5 METs, but not greater than 7 METs. The Board acknowledges that the July 2021 examiner initially found that the workload was equated to greater than 3 METs, but not greater than 5 METs; however, they also concluded that the service-connected knees contributed to that finding, and that without the knees, the findings would more accurately be represented as a workload of greater than 5 METs, but not greater than 7 METs. VA treatment records from this period are not in conflict with these findings.

Additionally, the Board finds that from January 24, 2023, the service-connected coronary artery disease is appropriately assigned a 60 percent evaluation, based on a on a workload greater than 3 METs, but not greater than 5 METs, solely attributable to the heart disability. An even higher 100 percent evaluation is not warranted without evidence that the workload was equivalent to 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms. VA treatment records from this period are not in conflict with these findings.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that because he continually pursued this claim since 2021, that a 60 percent evaluation should be assigned for the entire period; however, the evidence does not support a finding that the requirements necessary for a 60 percent evaluation were present for the entire appeal period. Separate disability ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time in accordance with the facts found. Such separate disability ratings are known as staged ratings. O'Connell v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 89, 91 (2007) (citing Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999)). A staged rating is designed to afford flexibility to assign greater disability ratings during periods in which the Veteran's disability may be more severe. See Id. ("Because the claims process before the agency can be lengthy, and because the level of a veteran's disability may fluctuate over time, staged ratings are a sensible mechanism for allowing the assignment of the most precise disability rating-one that accounts for the possible dynamic nature of a disability while the claim works its way through the adjudication process.").

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's lay statements that the disability is worse than currently evaluated and those statements have been considered. The Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). He is not, however, competent to identify a specific level of disability according to the appropriate diagnostic codes. Such competent evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's disability have been provided by the medical personnel who have examined the Veteran during the current appeal and who have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with the evaluations. The medical findings (as provided in the examination reports and the clinical records) directly address the criteria under which the disability is evaluated. The medical and lay evidence has been assessed by the Board in determining the overall disability rating.

Accordingly, the criteria for the claim of entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent prior to January 24, 2023, and in excess of 60 percent thereafter for service-connected coronary artery disease have not been met, and the appeal is denied.

In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt. In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. In other words, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021). Here, however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not in approximate balance, the doctrine is not for application. Id.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an increased rating for service-connected right knee patellofemoral syndrome, degenerative arthritis and meniscal tear is remanded.

2. Entitlement to an increased rating for service-connected left knee degenerative arthritis is remanded.

Where VA provides the veteran with an examination, the examination must be adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in May 2021, where the examiner was unable to test the left knee, but did not explain why. He underwent another examination in August 2021 where the examiner did not record the range of motion on passive motion. And at a February 2023 examination, the examiner neglected to address whether the knees required a prescription assistive device, which is a consideration under DC 5257 for recurrent subluxation or instability of the knees. The final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that VA examination reports include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint. Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016). Accordingly, a pre-decisional duty to assist error has been identified, and remand is required.

3. Entitlement to a TDIU prior to January 24, 2023 is remanded.

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to January 24, 2023 for SMC based on aid and attendance/housebound is remanded.

5. Entitlement to an earlier effective date January 24, 2023 for the basic eligibility to DEA is remanded.

Remand is required because entitlement to TDIU, SMC, and DEA are inextricably intertwined with the pending claims. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (holding that issues are inextricably intertwined and must be considered together when a decision concerning one could have a significant impact on the other).

By this remand the Board makes no determination, expressed or implied, concerning the credibility of any statements on file.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

?

1. Provide the Veteran with an appropriate examination to determine the severity of the service-connected knees. The entire claims file must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner. Any indicated tests and studies must be accomplished, and all clinical findings must be reported in detail and correlated to a specific diagnosis. An explanation for all opinions expressed must be provided. The relevant Disability Benefits Questionnaire must be utilized.

2. Readjudicate the claims of entitlement to a TDIU, SMC, and DEA prior to January 24, 2023.
