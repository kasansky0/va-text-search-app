ORDER

Reinstatement of a 20 percent rating for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve, effective February 9, 2024, is granted.

Reinstatement of a 20 percent rating for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve, effective February 9, 2024, is granted.

Reinstatement of a 10 percent rating for hypertension, effective February 9, 2024, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a February 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) reduced the rating for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve and the rating for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve, from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective February 9, 2024.

2. The reduction did not result in a reduction in the Veteran's overall compensation rate; therefore, the notice provisions of the regulation governing compensation rating reductions do not apply.

3. Improvement of the Veteran's right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability, and improvement of his ability to function under ordinary conditions of life and work due to the right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability, is not shown by the evidence.

4. In a February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ reduced the rating for hypertension from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective February 9, 2024. 

5. The reduction did not result in a reduction in the Veteran's overall compensation rate; therefore, the notice provisions of the regulation governing compensation rating reductions do not apply.

6.  The Veteran's medical history of hypertension during the review period did not show improvement of his ability to function under ordinary conditions of life and work, but did show fluctuating blood pressure readings, including systolic ratings in the 180s.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The reduction of the disability rating for a service-connected right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability from 20 percent to 10 percent was not proper, and the 20 percent rating is reinstated, effective February 9, 2024. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.344, 4.124a, DC 8526. 

2. The reduction of the disability rating for a service-connected left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability from 20 percent to 10 percent was not proper, and the 20 percent rating is reinstated, effective February 9, 2024. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.344, 4.124a, DC 8526. 

3. The reduction of the disability rating for a service-connected hypertension from 10 percent to 0 percent was not proper, and the 10 percent rating is reinstated, effective February 9, 2024. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.344, 4.104, DC 7101. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from January 1969 to May 1970, from November 1972 to September 1986, and from September 1991 to October 1993. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision. In the February 2024 rating decision, the rating for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve, rated at 20 percent, was reduced to 10 percent effective February 9, 2024, the rating for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve, rated at 20 percent, was reduced to 10 percent effective February 9, 2024, and the rating for hypertension, rated at 10 percent, was reduced to 0 percent effective February 9, 2024. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is also service-connected, in pertinent part, for right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy associated with multiple myeloma with progression to acute myeloid leukemia, monoclonal b-cell lymphocytosis and biclonal acute leukemia, right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy and polyradiculopathy associated with degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine associated with multiple myeloma with progression to acute myeloid, left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus type 2, and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus type 2. However, these disabilities are not currently before the Board in this appeal.    

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. The Veteran, through his VA Form 10182 and his July 2024 Appellate Brief, specifically appeals the reduction of his ratings for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve, left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve, and hypertension. Therefore, only the issue of the rating reductions for the Veteran's disability ratings for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are before the Board at this time. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Reduction - Law and Regulations

In a rating reduction, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, but also that the improvement actually reflects an improvement in a veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420-21; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, and 4.10 require that a reduction in rating be based upon review of the entire history of a veteran's disability. VA must then ascertain whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based on thorough examinations. Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000). VA is not limited, however, to medical indicators of improvement. Rather, VA may rely on non-medical indicators of improvement to show that a veteran is capable of more than marginal employment. Id. The examination reports on which the reduction is based must be adequate. Tucker v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 201 (1992) (holding that the failure of the examiner in that case to review the claims file rendered the reduction decision void ab initio).

In addressing whether improvement is shown, the comparison point generally is the last examination on which the rating at issue was assigned or continued. Hohol v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 169 (1992). Where, however, the rating was continued to see if improvement was in fact shown, the comparison point could include prior examinations as well. Collier v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 247 (1992).

Specific requirements must be met in order for VA to reduce certain ratings assigned for service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344; see also Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277 (1992). The requirements for reduction of ratings in effect for five years or more are set forth at 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a) and (b), which prescribe that only evidence of sustained material improvement under the ordinary conditions of life, as shown by full and complete examinations, can justify a reduction; these provisions prohibit a reduction on the basis of a single examination. See Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 417-18. Where doubt remains, the rating agency will continue the rating in effect, and consider scheduling reexamination 18, 24, or 30 months later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(b). Where a rating reduction was made without observance of law, the reduction must be vacated. Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 595.

Under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c), when a disability rating has been in effect for less than five years, a reexamination that shows improvement in a disability warrants a reduction in disability benefits. Specifically, it is necessary to ascertain, based upon a review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in disability and whether examination reports reflecting change are based upon thorough examinations. In addition, it must be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred and that such improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. See Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 420-21 (citing 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10 and 4.13); 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).

In determining whether the reductions were proper in this case, the Board must focus upon the evidence available to the AOJ at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of evaluating whether the disability had actually improved. Cf. Dofflemyer, 2 Vet. App. at 281-82. Such after-the-fact evidence may not be used to justify an improper reduction.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA will resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Anterior Crural Nerve - Femoral - Laws and Regulations

Under DC 8526, a 10 percent rating is warranted for mild incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerve; 20 percent for moderate incomplete paralysis; 30 percent for severe incomplete paralysis; and 40 percent for complete paralysis of the quadriceps extensor muscles. 38 C.F.R. 4.124a, § DC 8526.

When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  Neither the Rating Schedule nor the regulations provide definitions for descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe." See Spellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 157 (2018). Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must instead evaluate all the evidence, to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.

Although the rating criteria do not define "mild," "moderate," and "severe" according to Merriam Webster, "mild" means" gentle in nature or behavior" or "not being or involving what is extreme." "Moderate" means "tending toward the mean or average amount or dimension" or "limited in scope or effect." "Severe" means "very painful or harmful" or "of a great degree."  See www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe (last accessed April 8, 2025).

It should also be noted that use of terminology such as "severe" by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue. All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Although the Board is not bound by administrative manuals, it is relevant for guidance as to determining the severity of the Veteran's radiculopathy during the appeal. See Overton v. Wilke, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018).  

A VA administrative manual provides guidance on the terms mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe incomplete paralysis.  See VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (the "M21-1"), Part V.iii.12.A.2.c.

The M21-1 indicates that mild incomplete paralysis may be shown by "a very minimal reflex or motor abnormality" or "sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area."

Moderate incomplete paralysis may be shown by "combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree," or "motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate."

Severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve. See M21-1, Part V.iii.12.A.2.c.

Anterior Crural Nerve - Femoral - Evidence

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for Diabetic Sensory - Motor Peripheral Neuropathy. The Veteran reported that he had polyneuropathy but that he noticed his symptoms worsened after had been diagnosed with diabetes. He experienced severe neuropathy in his arms and legs which was treated with Lyrica. 

On objective examination, the Veteran's symptom of constant pain in his right and left lower extremities were marked "moderate." The Veteran's symptom of intermittent pain in his right and left lower extremities were marked "severe," his symptom of paresthesias and/or dysesthesias for his right and left lower extremities were marked "severe," and his symptom of numbness in his right and left lower extremities were marked "severe." His knee extension, knee flexion, ankle plantar flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion for his lower extremities were all marked 4/5 indicating less than normal strength. The Veteran's deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) for his knees and ankles were marked 1+ indicating they were decreased. For light touch/monofilament testing the Veteran's knees/thighs and ankles/lower legs were marked normal, but his feet/toes were marked decreased. The Veteran's position sense in his lower extremities were normal while the vibration sensation was not tested. The Veteran's cold sensation was absent from both lower extremities.

The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy but did have trophic changes attributable to diabetic peripheral neuropathy, specifically hairless legs. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran did have lower extremity diabetic neuropathy of both the sciatic nerve and femoral nerve. For the right and left lower extremity, the VA examiner marked that the Veteran had moderate incomplete paralysis. 

In February 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for Peripheral Nerves Conditions (Not Including Diabetic Sensory - Motor Peripheral Neuropathy). The Veteran reported experiencing bilateral lower extremity numbness, tingling, and pain that affected his daily activities. He reported that he had constant numbness and tingling in his feet and his lower legs, with occasional sharp shooting pains that occurred randomly. He was currently being treated with gabapentin. 

The Veteran's symptom of constant pain in his right and left lower extremities were marked "none." The Veteran's symptom of intermittent pain in his right and left lower extremities were marked "moderate," his symptom of paresthesias and/or dysesthesias for his right and left lower extremities were marked "moderate," and his symptom of numbness in his right and left lower extremities were marked "severe." His knee extension, knee flexion, ankle plantar flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion were all marked 5/5 indicating normal strength. The Veteran's deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) for his knees and ankles were marked 2+ indicating they were normal. For light touch/ monofilament testing the Veteran's knees/thighs were marked normal, his ankles/lower legs were marked decreased, and his feet/toes were marked absent. 

The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy but did have trophic changes, specifically hairless legs. The VA examiner marked that the Veteran's anterior crural (femoral) nerve was "normal" for both the right and left lower extremity. 

Anterior Crural Nerve - Femoral - Analysis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to the 20 percent rating for both his right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability and his left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability. See July 2024 Appellate Brief.  

For the reasons expressed below, the Board finds that reinstatement of the 20 percent rating for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability and a reinstatement of the 20 percent rating for a left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability, effective February 9, 2024, is warranted.  

Based upon the Veteran's reported symptoms and the objective medical evidence from both the January 2024 VA examination and February 2024 VA examination, including severe numbness, trophic changes of hairless legs attributed to the Veteran's neuropathy of the right and left lower extremities, and competent reports of shooting pains, the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy disabilities do not show that the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life has improved. 

The Board notes that there is conflict between the January 2024 and February 2024 VA examination. Mainly, the January 2024 examiner determined that the Veteran had moderate incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerve for both the right and left lower extremities while the February 2024 examiner determined that the femoral nerve was "normal" for both the right and left lower extremities. However, the February 2024 VA examiner made several findings, such as decreased sensation in response to light touch/monofilament testing of the Veteran's right and left ankle/lower leg, reports of constant numbness and tingling in the Veteran's feet, and the impact of these symptoms on the Veteran's abilities to perform activities that demonstrate a worsening of the Veteran's disabilities since the January 2024 examination. As these exams occurred within one month of each other, the Board finds that the Veteran's right and left lower extremity disability more than likely had not improved in the month between the January 2024 and February 2024 VA examinations.

The Board further notes that the AOJ failed to discuss whether the improvement represented "an actual improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work." In other word, the AOJ's analysis merely focused on why the Veteran's disability did not warrant a higher rating.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the reductions were not proper and reinstatement of the 20 percent rating for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability and his left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve disability, effective February 9, 2024, are warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8526.

Hypertension - Laws and Regulations

DC 7101 provides a 10 percent disability evaluation when diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more, or the individual has a history of diastolic pressure of 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent disability evaluation is warranted when diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure is 200 or more. A 40 percent evaluation is warranted where diastolic pressure is predominantly 120 or more, and a 60 percent evaluation is warranted where diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 130 or more. With regard to a 10 percent rating, "The plain text of DC 7101 directs VA to consider historical, rather than current, blood pressure readings and that the relevant 'historical blood pressure readings' are those taken before the veteran began medication." See Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75, 76 (2021).

There are three notes to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101. Note (1) provides that hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days. For purposes of this section, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure (i.e., bottom number) is predominantly 90 mm or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension  means the systolic blood pressure (i.e., top number) is predominantly 160 mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm. Note (2) requires the evaluation of hypertension due to aortic insufficiency or hyperthyroidism, which is usually the isolated systolic type, as part of the condition causing it rather than by a separate evaluation. Note (3) states that hypertension should be evaluated separately from hypertensive heart disease and other types of heart disease.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Predominantly means "being most frequent or common." See Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant (last accessed March 4, 2025). In the context of DC 7101, this means "above a certain level more often than it was below it." See Thompkins v. McDonald, No. 15-4128, 2016 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 2013 (Dec. 29, 2016) (Greenberg, J.) (accepting this definition of predominant in the Board's decision and affirming based on the Board's application of the definition to the facts of that case); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

The Board notes that, because DC 7101 lists "continuous medication for control" as a criterion in the 10 percent rating, the DC, when read as a whole, contemplates the effects of medication in assigning a disability evaluation. See McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 272-73 (2016).

Hypertension - Evidence

In February 2023, the Veteran's blood pressure was 151/91. See February 2023 Dentistry Note.  In March 2023, the Veteran's blood pressure was 145/77. See March 2023 Mental Health Telehealth Note.  In April 2023, the Veteran's blood pressure was 156/87. See April 2023 Dentistry Note. 

In June 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for Hypertension. The Veteran's diagnosis of hypertension was confirmed. The Veteran took three different daily medications to treat his hypertension. The three blood pressure readings taken at the examination are as follows: 182/99, 181/98, and 185/97.

In August 2023, the Veteran's blood pressure was 137/84. See August 2023 Dentistry Note. 

In February 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for Hypertension. The Veteran's diagnosis of hypertension, which he had received in 2000, was confirmed. The Veteran reported that he began treatment for his high blood pressure about 15 years ago and that his blood pressure has been pretty well controlled over the years. The Veteran took daily medications to treat his hypertension. The three blood pressure readings taken during the examination are as follows: 142/78, 144/79, and 142/77.

Hypertension - Analysis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to reinstatement of the 10 percent rating for his hypertension. See July 2024 Appellate Brief.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that the ameliorative effects of medication should not be considered when determining the disability rating for his hypertension. See July 2024 Appellate Brief. The Board may not discount the effects of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 62-63 (2012). However, as applicable in this case, VA has contemplated the effects of medication as a factor to be considered when rating hypertension under DC 7101. See McCarroll, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271-73 (holding that Jones does not apply to DC 7101). In other words, the rating criteria for hypertension already considers the ameliorative effects of medication. Id. As such, the Board is not required to discuss the ameliorative effects of medication when evaluating whether the Veteran improvement has in fact been shown.

Nevertheless, for the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that reinstatement of a 10 percent disability rating for hypertension is warranted. Specifically, a review of the evidence documents that the Veteran had blood pressure readings that showed systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, and there was no improvement of the Veteran's disability. Additionally, there is no indication that the AOJ considered the Veteran's medical history during the review period that documented fluctuating blood pressure readings, including systolic ratings in the 180s. Accordingly, the Board finds that, at the very least, a history of systolic pressure predominately 160 or more is demonstrated, which does not support any improvement in disability. This finding coupled with the fact that the Veteran's hypertension had still required continuous medication for control entitles him to reinstatement of the 10 percent rating under DC 7101.

The Board notes that the AOJ failed to discuss whether the improvement represented "an actual improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work." In other word, the AOJ's analysis merely focused on why the Veteran's disability did not warrant a higher rating.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the reduction was not proper and reinstatement of the 10 percent rating for hypertension, effective February 9, 2024, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, regarding the higher rating claims adjudicated herein. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 69-70 (2017).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
