DOCKET NO. 240410-431382
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to whether the retroactive award was properly calculated in effectuating a November 2023 rating decision is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) has not adjudicated a claim disputing the calculation of the retroactive award owed due to the November 2023 rating decision; therefore, the appeal was premature, and the Board must dismiss the matter, as such is not ripe for appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal, as to whether the retroactive award was properly calculated in effectuating a November 2023 rating decision, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1987 to December 1993.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2024 VA Form 10182 in which the Veteran stated that he was seeking review, under the Board's direct review docket, of the amount of a retroactive award owed due to a November 2023 rating decision.

By way of history, the Veteran was granted entitlement to a TDIU in a November 2023 AOJ rating decision, with an effective date for the TDIU as of September 17, 2014. The Veteran's TDIU award was effective to the date of claim, i.e., the date VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ. The Veteran has not appealed the effective date of his award of TDIU.

On the April 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD, the Veteran asserted that "the retro pay amount is way less than the calculation shows." However, he did not indicate what "the calculation shows" or what amount of retroactive payment he actually received.

Moreover, while the Veteran's VA Form 10182 identified the November 2023 rating decision as the decision on appeal, this decision, while awarding TDIU and adjudicating other matters, did not determine or identify the amount of retroactive payment due to the Veteran. The November 2023 Notification Letter, sent to the Veteran along with the decision, similarly does not contain a determination of the retroactive pay due. Instead, the Notification Letter reflected the increased monthly award, including a table of the changes in "Monthly Entitlement Amount" throughout the period on appeal, starting October 1, 2014, and indicating the months when rates were adjusted due to cost of living, minor child adjustment, or other reasons. 

Each entry in that table reflects the baseline of a 100 percent rating compensation amount resulting from the TDIU award beginning October 2014. But this does not mean the Veteran was owed the full amount listed for each month included in the table. This is because the Veteran was already receiving service-connected compensation from VA throughout the entire period on appeal prior to TDIU being awarded in the November 2023 rating decision, at varying rates between 70 to 90 percent. As such, for any retroactive payment, he would not have received the full amount listed in the table's "Monthly Entitlement Amount" for any of the months during the appeal period, but rather would have received a net amount after accounting (deducting) for monies previously received. The Board hopes this is helpful to the Veteran in understanding why there may have been a perceived discrepancy with the amount he ended up receiving.

Regardless, the fact remains that the November 2023 Notification Letter does not identify the amount of retroactive pay due to the Veteran, and there is no indication in the record that the Veteran has sought a financial audit with the AOJ, nor is there a pending AOJ claim pertaining to the contended miscalculation. The Veteran has also not disputed the effective date of the payments nor the entitlement amount for any particular months listed; he has merely asserted that the retroactive award as a whole was improperly calculated. But the decision purporting to be appealed does not reflect a decision of the amount of retroactive net payment to be awarded after taking into account payments the Veteran previously received.

In short, the Board finds there is no decision that can be properly appealed regarding the amount of retroactive payment resulting from the November 2023 rating decision at this time. As such, the appeal must be dismissed as the Veteran's April 2024 VA Form 10182 does not list a "decision" as to retroactive payment amount, from which the Veteran could properly appeal. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(a), 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.203.

NONETHELESS, IF THE VETERAN BELIEVES THAT THE AMOUNT OF RETROACTIVE PAYMENT RESULTING FROM THE NOVEMBER 2023 RATING DECISION WAS IMPROPERLY CALCULATED, OR IF HE BELIEVES HE HAS NOT RECEIVED SUCH RETROACTIVE PAYMENT, HE IS ENCOURAGED TO REQUEST A FINANCIAL AUDIT.
