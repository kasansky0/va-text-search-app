ORDER

A 30 percent rating, but no higher, for asthma is granted, subject to the criteria governing the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran served on active duty from October 1974 to November 1994.

2. Asthma requires a daily inhaler but no monthly exacerbations or the use of systemic corticosteroids.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 30 percent rating, but no higher, for asthma have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.321, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

This decision has been written under the guidelines of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied a compensable rating for asthma. In September 2024, the Veteran appealed to the Board via a Form 10182 and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Turning to the relevant laws and regulations, disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

Asthma is currently rated as noncompensable pursuant to DC 6602. Under that diagnostic code, a higher rating is warranted where the evidence shows the following:

"	bronchial asthma with FEV-1 of 71 to 80 percent predicted; or FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent; or intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy (10 percent); 

"	bronchial asthma with FEV-1 of 56- to 70-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or; daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy, or; inhalational anti-inflammatory medication (30 percent); 

"	bronchial asthma with FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or; at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or; intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids (60 percent).

38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(4) provides that post-bronchodilator studies are required when pulmonary function test scores (PFTs) are done for disability evaluation purposes except when the results of pre-bronchodilator PFTs are normal or when the examiner determines that post-bronchodilator studies should not be done and states why.

Turning to the evidence, an October 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran used Zyrtec daily, Fluticasone/Salmeterol inhaler daily, and Albuterol rescue inhaler as needed for asthma. The examiner stated that the asthma did not require the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medication, antibiotics or oxygen therapy. However, the examiner noted that it required daily inhalational bronchodilator therapy, daily inhalational anti-inflammatory medication, and daily oral bronchodilators. There were no asthmatic attacks with respiratory failure in the past 12 months and no physician visits for required care of exacerbations.

PFT revealed FVC of 89 percent predicted, FEV-1 of 81 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 92 percent. Post-bronchodilator results were not performed because the examiner indicated that pre-bronchodilator tests were normal. The examiner opined that FEV-1 percent predicted most accurately reflected the Veteran's level of difficulty. DLCO testing was not accomplished as the examiner opined that it was not indicated for the Veteran. The examiner opined that asthma did not impact the Veteran's ability to work.

There are no other medical records reflecting more severe symptoms, treatment, or PFTs than listed above.

After review, the evidence of record reflects that 30 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted. In this regard, the medical evidence indicates that asthma requires the use of daily inhalational bronchodilator therapy, daily inhalational anti-inflammatory medication, and daily oral bronchodilators. This evidence falls squarely within the criteria for a 30 percent rating. Accordingly, the asthma symptomatology warrants a 30 percent rating, and the appeal is granted to this extent.

A higher 60 percent rating is not warranted, however, as the medical evidence does not show post-bronchodilator results of FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent. Further, there is no evidence of at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or any use of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids. Therefore, there is no evidence that the Veteran's symptoms meet the criteria for a 60 percent rating. 

In granting a higher 30 percent rating, the Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements regarding her symptoms as well as the evidence provided by the medical personnel who have examined her during the current appeal and who have rendered a pertinent opinion in conjunction with the evaluation. In sum, after a careful review of the evidence of record, a 30 percent rating, but no more, for asthma is granted.

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, for the Board's consideration. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
