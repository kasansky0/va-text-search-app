ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for depression with anxiety and insomnia (claimed as depression, anxiety, insomnia) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The competent evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran's depression with anxiety and insomnia is causally related to the Veteran's active duty military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for depression with anxiety and insomnia have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Navy from June 1985 to February 1987. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection.

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after the military discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to the period of military service, establishes that the disease was incurred during the active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1113 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. See Masors v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181 (1992). Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value.

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, the VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the Veteran.

Entitlement to service connection for depression with anxiety and insomnia is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for depression with anxiety and insomnia.  Having carefully reviewed the evidence of record, and considering all applicable laws and regulations, the Board finds that the Veteran's contention is warranted.

Initially, the April 2024 rating decision concedes that the Veteran has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and insomnia.  Further, the Veteran submitted a March 2024 statement is support of his claim in which he describes an in-service occurrence.  Specifically, the Veteran stated that he was stationed on the U.S.S. Detroit when it was involved in bombing Libya in 1986.  Accordingly, the Board finds the first two elements of service connection have been met.  The remaining issue to be decided is whether the Veteran's depression with anxiety and insomnia is causally related to his in-service event.

The Veteran submitted a November 2023 private medical review in support of his claim.  The private examiner found that the evidence of record supported diagnoses of major depression, anxiety, and insomnia.  The examiner additionally found that it was not possible to differentiate what symptoms are attributable to each diagnosis.  In support of her diagnoses, the examiner indicated that the Veteran suffered from depression, anxiety, suspiciousness, near continuous panic, chronic sleep impairment, memory loss, flattened affect, and disturbances of motivation and mood.  The examiner also found that the Veteran had suicidal ideation, difficulty establishing and maintaining relationships, difficulty dealing with stress, difficulty with work relationships, neglect of personal hygiene, inability to perform activities of daily living, and disorientation to time or place.  The examiner took a history of the Veteran having been aboard the U.S.S. Detroit when that ship was involved in the 1986 armed conflict with Libya.  The examiner ultimately found that it is more likely than not that the Veteran's participation in that event led to the Veteran developing depression with anxiety and insomnia.  

As stated previously, the Veteran submitted a March 2024 statement in support of his claim.  In his statement, the Veteran indicated that his symptoms of depression with anxiety and insomnia began during service and have continued to the present.  The Veteran specifically indicated that his anxiety first began when the ship he was stationed on, the U.S.S. Detroit, was involved in bombing Libya.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statements in support of his claim.  In his March 2024 statement, the Veteran avers that his psychological symptoms had an in-service onset and continue to this day.  The Board finds the Veteran credible to the extent that he has reported his symptoms and the onset of his symptoms.  The Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and on that of which he has personal knowledge.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  

As there is no medical evidence to the contrary, the evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of the claim of entitlement to service connection for depression with anxiety and insomnia.  Therefore, the claim for service connection for depression with anxiety and insomnia is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
