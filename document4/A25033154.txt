ORDER

Entitlement to an initial 50 percent disability rating for tension headaches is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period the Veteran's tension headaches are characterized by very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial 50 percent disability rating for tension headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R.        §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321(a), 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2001 through June 2004 in the United States Army. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.? 

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement: VA Form 10182 and selected the Direct Review docket. Based on that docket selection, the Board is limited in its review of the evidence and may only consider the evidence of record at the time the October 2023 rating decision on appeal was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the October 2023 rating decision on appeal was issued the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R.         §§ 20.300, 20.801.?? 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C.  § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

Entitlement to a 50 percent disability rating for tension headaches

Legal Criteria 

DC 8100 provides the schedule of ratings for migraines. A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100. A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months. Id.  The maximum schedular 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. Id. 

Factual Background 

The Veteran contends that his tension headaches warrant the maximum 50 percent disability rating. 

In a June 2021 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran reported that he gets headaches daily. Additionally, he noted that his headache pains are typically located on alternating sides of his head. He also noted that these headaches sometimes are so severe that they cause him to miss work or do normal daily activities. The Veteran describes the headaches as causing him to be completely incapacitated for several hours. 

During a June 2021 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran experienced headaches twice weekly with no characteristic prostrating attacks and which did not produce severe economic inadaptability.

During an August 2022 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran experienced headaches on average twice weekly without characteristics of prostrating attacks and that do not produce severe economic inadaptability.

The Veteran had his tension headaches evaluated privately in June 2023. In the clinician's report it is noted that the Veteran experiences headaches weekly with multiple times a month experiencing incapacitating episodes. The clinician also noted the Veteran having missed approximately one month of work during the previous year due to his headaches.

In a June 2023 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran detailed his tension headache symptoms. He notes that he experiences headaches weekly, causing pain in various locations of his head. He also states that 5 to 6 times per month he misses work due to the headache pains. The Veteran also notes that the headaches are at times completely incapacitating and prevent him from doing daily activities. The Veteran also notes that he has missed a month of work time in the last year due to his headaches.

In an August 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted the Veteran experiences headaches 2 to 3 times per week without characteristics of prostrating attacks.

Analysis

Based on the above evidence, and affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board determines that the Veteran's tension headaches warrant an initial disability rating of 50 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100.

VA regulations do not specifically define "prostrating." By way of reference, the Board notes that according to Webster's New World Dictionary of American English, Third College Edition (1986), p.1080, "prostration" is defined as "utter physical exhaustion or helplessness." Further, the Court has held that the phrase "prostrating attacks" plainly describes migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?245 (2018). 

The Board notes that the Veteran has been consistent in his statements regarding the frequency and severity of his headaches. From the time of his initial service connection claim, the Veteran has stated that he has had to miss work because of his headaches and that they cause him to have to stay in bed and avoid light and sound, cause fatigue, and are completely incapacitating to the point that he cannot do daily activities. Further, he has consistently reported several headaches per week, alleviated only slightly by medication, which lasts several hours at a time. 

The Board acknowledges that in all the VA examinations, the examiners found that the Veteran's headaches did not constitute prostrating attacks of pain. However, the Veteran's June 2023 private evaluation notes that the Veteran's frequency of missed worked and severity of pain would indicate prostrating attacks.

The Board finds that the Veteran's lay statements regarding the frequency and severity of his headaches as well as the June 2023 private evaluation more probative than that of the VA examiner's determination. Prostration, under the above referenced definition, would include missing work, having to stay in bed all day, being physically fatigued, and unable to complete daily activities.

Accordingly, and resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's tension headaches more nearly approximate a 50 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 4.124a, DC 8100.
