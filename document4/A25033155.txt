ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not currently have a right shoulder disability and has not had a right shoulder disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the appeal, to include functional impairment of earning capacity.

2. The Veteran's left shoulder disability is not related to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1986 to December 1996.  The Veteran received numerous awards during his active service to include the Southwest Asia Service Medal and Kuwait Liberation Medal.  The Board thanks the Veteran for his honorable service.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Duty to Assist

In January 2018, the Veteran requested a copy of his service treatment records. In a February 2018, letter, VA notified the Veteran that it was processing his request. In a separate letter dated that same day, VA notified the Veteran that there were no such records on file. 

In a November 2018 letter, the AOJ advised the Veteran that his service department records cannot be located and are unavailable for review.  See November 2018 Final Attempt Letter.  The letter stated that all efforts to obtain the records have been exhausted and VA has determined that further attempts to obtain the records would be futile.  The AOJ then requested that the Veteran submit any evidence in his possession, which can include additional information such as buddy statements.  To date, no response to the November 2018 letter has been received.  The Board reminds the Veteran the duty to assist is a two-way-street.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  Since a response was not submitted by the Veteran, the Board does not have reason to believe that additional records are outstanding.  The Board finds that the November 2018 letter complies with VA's heightened duty to assist.  See Dixon, 3 Vet. App. 261.  There is no outstanding Privacy Act request. Accordingly, the Board will proceed with its review of the claims.

Service Connection

Generally, to establish service connection a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Certain chronic diseases such as arthritis will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Lay evidence cannot be determined to be not credible merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability.

The Veteran claims service connection for a right and left shoulder disability.

As an initial matter, the October 2022 rating decision made a favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a current disability of left shoulder strain.  See also September 2021 Physical Therapy Note, Sacramento VAMC.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding absent clear and unmistakable error. 

The Veteran's June 1985 enlistment examination and report of medical history are silent for a right or left shoulder defect or complaint.  Service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect any symptoms of or treatment for a right or left shoulder disability; however, most of the Veteran's STRs are missing.  See August 2018 Military Personnel Record.  The Veteran's separation examination and report of medical history are also not of record.  Thus, the Board has a heightened duty to consider the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Dixon v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 261, 263-64 (1992).  As such, the analysis below has been undertaken with this heightened duty in mind.  The case law does not, however, lower the legal standard for proving a claim for service connection but rather increases the Board's obligation to evaluate and discuss in its decision all of the evidence that may be favorable to the claimant.  See Russo v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 46 (1996). 

In June 2022, the Veteran filed his service connection claim and stated his shoulder disabilities were caused by being a mechanic in the Marine Corps and suffering damage due to repeated movements and lifting.  See June 2022 VA Form 526-EZ.

VA treatment records reveal the Veteran first reported left shoulder pain in August 2010.  The Veteran stated that a piece of pressure treated lumber got lodged in his shoulder the previous week.  He said the wound "festered" and he dug out the piece of wood.  Upon examination, the clinician assessed the left shoulder as appearing "ok."  The Veteran was asked to follow up in the clinic in 11 months for another routine examination.  In August 2021, the Veteran presented to his primary care physician with left shoulder pain.  The Veteran told the clinician that he works as a contractor and does a lot of lifting.  He denied any shoulder trauma.  The clinician stated that a physical examination was consistent with rotator cuff tendinitis; he recommended an x-ray and physical therapy.  An August 2021 left shoulder x-ray showed mild osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral and acromial clavicular joints.  The Veteran was subsequently referred to physical therapy for left shoulder rotator cuff strain.  See September 2021 Physical Therapy Note.  In a September 2021 physical therapy treatment record, the Veteran reported a 2 year history of left shoulder pain that has been progressively worsening.  He denied any injury at the time and felt his symptoms came on with an insidious onset.  Aggravating factors include sleeping on his left side and attempting to raise his arm overhead.  The Veteran reported working as a contractor in construction and carrying cement bags and lumber over his shoulder multiple times throughout the day.  

There are no VA treatment records during the period on appeal relating to the right shoulder.  There are no private treatment records associated with the claims file.

The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for his right and left shoulders.  On the Veteran's January 2023 VA Form 10182, he stated that he disagrees with not being provided with a VA examination for his shoulders.

The Board notes that it is VA's duty to assist a claimant, and this includes providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  In determining whether VA's duty to assist requires a VA examination or medical opinion, four factors are for consideration: (1) whether there is competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) whether there is evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or evidence establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period; (3) whether there is an indication that the disability or symptoms may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability; and (4) whether there otherwise is sufficient competent medical evidence of record to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

Here, the record does not contain competent evidence of a current right shoulder disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of such.  Although the record contains a current left shoulder disability, there is no indication the Veteran injured it during service.  There are no treatment records during active service indicating that the Veteran was treated for or diagnosed with a right or left shoulder disability.  STRs do not reveal any complains of pain in either shoulder during active service.  The evidence of record reveals the Veteran has been diagnosed with left shoulder osteoarthritis, but that diagnosis was not rendered until 2021, and the record contains no evidence indicating the Veteran was diagnosed with arthritis sooner, to include within 1 year of discharge from active service.  In addition, his VA treatment records indicate he reported a puncture wound to his left shoulder in August 2010 and in August 2021 he reported a 2 year history of left shoulder pain with insidious onset.  The record does not reveal the Veteran has reported bilateral shoulder pain since service.  Lastly, the Veteran has made no statements pointing to a specific injury during active service related to his claims of right and left shoulder disabilities.  The Veteran stated his shoulder disabilities are due to repeated movements and lifting rather than identifying a specific injury.

Evidence of a current disability is a fundamental requirement for a grant of service connection.  See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Board acknowledges the holding in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). However, the medical evidence reveals no functional impairment of earning capacity with respect to the right shoulder.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms; however, he does not possess the medical training necessary to render a competent opinion about the etiology of a disability.  Jandreau, 492 F. 3d 1372.  Therefore, the Veteran's lay assertions, alone, are insufficient to establish a nexus between his shoulder disabilities and active service.  Even with full consideration of the Veteran's contention that his right and left shoulder disabilities stem from overuse, the Board observes that the Veteran has not pointed to any incident in service where he complained of an injury or received treatment in connection with an overuse injury, other than asserting that his current right and left shoulder disabilities stem from the physical rigors associated with his military occupational specialty (MOS).

Lastly, the Board has considered that the Veteran is diagnosed with left shoulder osteoarthritis, and that arthritis is a chronic disease that will be presumed related to service if it is diagnosed within 1 year of discharge from service.  However, the persuasive evidence indicates that the Veteran's left shoulder arthritis was not diagnosed within 1 year of separation.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307(a)(3), 3.309.

As such, the Veteran does not meet the "low threshold" necessary to establish entitlement to a VA medical examination or medical opinion in connection with the claims.  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 81.

The Board recognizes there is evidence that the Veteran may have participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) in service.   See January 2023 VA Memo.  Although VA has an obligation to obtain medical opinions for any service connection claim which cannot be granted where there is evidence of a TERA and of a current disability, VA has identified several exceptions to this general obligation.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b).  Specifically, a TERA examination is not required for (1) claims based on physical trauma (including trauma due to repetitive use); (2) mental disorders; (3) disabilities that have not been shown to have any positive association with herbicide exposure; and (4) claims for disabilities that manifested during service or with a clear etiology that is not associated with toxic exposure.  See VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).  Because the shoulder claims here are based on physical trauma, an exception applies and a TERA examination is not warranted.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims for service connection for a right shoulder disability and a left shoulder disability.  Accordingly, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).  Therefore, the claims for service connection for a right shoulder disability and a left shoulder disability are denied.
