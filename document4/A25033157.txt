ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable initial rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The competing lay and medical evidence weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis was manifested by greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. The evidence is not in approximate balance.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a compensable initial rating for allergic rhinitis are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2004 to July 2004, June 2005 to August 2005 and June 2008 to June 2009. 

These matters are before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal of a February 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). This decision was a higher-level review (HLR) of a prior October 2023 decision.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 19, 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the October 19, 2023 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran contends that his allergic rhinitis is more severely disabling than contemplated by the currently assigned noncompensable rating. Entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis was granted in an October 12, 2023 rating decision, effective August 10, 2022. The Veteran was notified of that decision on October 18, 2023. On October 19, 2023 the AOJ, of its own accord, issued a rating decision denying a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis. The Veteran requested higher-level review of the October 19, 2023 rating decision, and entitlement to an increased rating was denied in a February 2024 higher-level review rating decision. The Veteran appealed from that higher-level review rating decision. 

In its October 19, 2023 review, the AOJ stated that the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for allergic rhinitis originated from the Veteran's March 2023 supplemental claim which is the claim which resulted in the initial grant of service connection for this disability. As such, it appears that the October 19, 2023 rating decision constitutes a reevaluation of the initial rating assigned by the October 12, 2023 rating decision. Thus, the appeal is from the initial rating for allergic rhinitis. 

Under DC 6522, a 10 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. A 30 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.

In a November 2021 private medical opinion, Dr. C.C. stated that the Veteran reported current symptoms of allergic rhinitis included frequent coughing, headaches, nasal stuffiness, thick mucus and congestion which caused difficulty breathing. The Veteran stated that his doctor had told him that he had a nasal blockage in both nasal passages. He used multiple medications to treat his symptoms. 

On VA examination in May 2023, the Veteran reported symptoms of tenderness over the bilateral maxillary sinus, occurring two to three times per week, as well as congestion and post-nasal drainage. He reported taking medication to treat these symptoms. The examiner found that rhinitis was not manifested by polyps or by greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.

On VA examination in August 2023, the Veteran reported symptoms of swelling behind eye and nose, tiredness and headaches which improved with medication. The examiner again found rhinitis was not manifested by polyps or by greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. 

The evidence of record weighs persuasively against finding that a compensable rating is warranted for allergic rhinitis. While the Veteran reported nasal stuffiness which caused difficulty breathing, there is no evidence that nasal obstruction rose to the level of greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side during the appeal period.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's report to Dr. C.C. that he had been told by a doctor that he had a blockage in both nasal passages. It is not clear when the Veteran was told that he had a nasal blockage, or whether such blockage constituted a greater than 50 percent obstruction on both sides or complete obstruction one side. As discussed above, the May and August 2023 VA examinations did not find an obstruction which met the criteria for a higher rating, nor does any other medical evidence relevant to the period on appeal show such an obstruction. Accordingly, the Board attributes greater probative value to the May and August 2023 VA examinations than to the Veteran's report. 

Additionally, while the Veteran stated that a doctor told him he had a nasal blockage, the Veteran has not sufficiently identified any related outstanding treatment records to trigger VA's duty to assist. See, e.g., Loving v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 96, 103 (2005) (explaining that section 5103A "require[s] that the claimant adequately identify relevant records that the claimant wishes the Secretary to obtain"); Gobber v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 470, 472 (1992) ("In connection with the search for documents, th[e] duty [to assist] is limited to specifically identified documents that by their description would be facially relevant and material to the claim.") The Veteran was notified by his July 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ to complete and sign a VA Form 21-4142, "identifying any private medical record you wish VA to request for you." He was also notified that he should submit all relevant private treatment records. However, he did not identify what doctor treated his rhinitis or when and when such treatment occurred, nor did he submit a VA Form 21-4142 for any private providers. In the absence of this information, the Board finds no pre-decisional duty to assist error pertaining to any insufficiently identified private records.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports of symptoms of pain, frequent coughing, headaches, nasal stuffiness and thick mucus. The Veteran is separately service connected for sinusitis, rated 30 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6513. That DC contemplates symptoms of headaches, pain and purulent discharge or crusting. Any additional award of benefits based on those symptoms would violate the rule against pyramiding (rating the same disability or its manifestations under different DCs). See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

The symptoms of swelling behind the eyes and nose, tiredness and coughing are not explicitly contemplated either by DC 6513 or 6522. However, allergic rhinitis is defined as a general term used to denote any allergic reaction of the nasal mucosa; it may occur perennially (nonseasonal allergic) or seasonally (hay fever). Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 1639 (32nd ed. 2012). Seasonal allergies (sometimes called hay fever) are defined as "a type of allergic rhinitis that occurs at the same time every year, marked by acute conjunctivitis [of the eyes] and lacrimation and itching, swelling of the nasal mucosa, sneezing, and often asthmatic symptoms." Id. at 692. Considering these definitions, the Veteran's complaints of swelling behind the eyes and nose, and coughing are contemplated in the rating criteria which consider the symptomatology associated with nasal obstruction and/or polyps. Tiredness is an expected result of these symptoms and is therefore also contemplated by the rating criteria.

Finally, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran uses medication to treat his rhinitis symptoms. In Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that, when assigning a disability rating, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where those effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria. "Thus, if [the applicable DC] does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication, the Board is required, pursuant to Jones, to discount the ameliorative effects of medication when evaluating [the disability]. Conversely, if [the applicable DC] does specifically contemplate the effects of medication, then Jones is inapplicable." McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (en banc). Here, DC 6522 does not contemplate the effects of medication. However, while the Veteran uses medication, in part, to reduce nasal congestion, there is no evidence of record that, in the absence of medication, the Veteran's rhinitis nasal congestion would be so severe as to approximate a greater than 50 percent obstruction on both sides, a complete obstruction one side, or result in polyps. Therefore, no higher rating can be assigned on this basis.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether a compensable initial rating for allergic rhinitis is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that allergic rhinitis was manifested by allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), Lynch, supra. The claim is denied.
