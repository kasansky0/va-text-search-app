ORDER

Service connection other specified trauma and stressor related disorder, due to military sexual trauma (MST), is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the evidence of record supports a finding that his other specified trauma and stressor related disorder is related to in-service incurrence of MST.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1985 to June 1989.

The rating decision on appeal was issued on December 8, 2021 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

A December 2023 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision denied entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). See BVA Decision (December 2023). In a September 2024 Order, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) granted a joint motion for remand (JMR) and vacated the Board's decision, remanding the matter for action consistent with the terms of the JMR. See CAVC Decision (September 2024).

A September 24, 2024, Board letter, notified the Veteran that the appeal had been returned to the Board, and that this appeal is being held in abeyance until 90 days from September 24, 2024, such that the Veteran may submit any additional argument should he choose to do so. See BVA Post CAVC Notice (September 2024). Accordingly, as the 90 day period, from September 24, 2024, has lapsed, and the Veteran has not requested an extension, the Board will proceed with consideration. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.

The Veteran contends, in part, that his acquired psychiatric disorder was caused by his service, to include two incidents of MST, occurring in June/July 1985 and September 1985. See Compensation (October 2020); VA 21-0781 (October 2020). 

The Veteran reported that during basic training while stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in June/July 1985, he was sexually assaulted in the shower of his barracks by way of an attempt by another servicemember to force him to have sex. He also reported that during advanced individual training (AIT) while stationed at Fort Gordon, Georgia, in September 1985, he was again sexually assaulted in the bathroom of this barracks by way of an attempt by another servicemember to force him to have oral sex. See VA 21-0781 (October 2020); VA 21-0781a (June 2021). However, he did not report the incidents in-service due to a fear of repercussion. See Hearing Transcript at 8 (August 2023). 

The Board concludes that the criteria for service connection for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

First, the Board finds that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed mental disorder. Specifically, a March 2021 VA-obtained PTSD Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) reflects a diagnosis for "other specified trauma and stressor related disorder." Likewise, a November 2021 PTSD DBQ reflects the same. Here, it is uncontroverted that there is a diagnosed mental disorder conforming to the DSM-5. Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393, 401 (2020), aff'd sub nom. Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F.4th 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2022) ((holding that a diagnosis under DSM-5 is required for compensation for psychiatric disabilities). Therefore, the first element of service connection is met.

Second, the Board finds that there is an in-service injury, described as MST. In this regard, although the MST is not documented in the Veteran's service treatment records or service personnel records, there is a marker in service supporting the occurrence of the injury; and medical evidence that this marker is sufficient to establish the occurrent of the injury. Specifically, the Veteran's military personnel records show that he was instructed regarding his unexcused absence from a scheduled unit training assembly or multiple unit training assembly on September 16th and 17th, 1989. See Military Personnel Record at 68 (December 2020). A December 2021 VA-obtained medical opinion reflects that there is evidence of the MST stressor occurrence, which is the unexcused absence in September 1989. Therefore, second element of service connection is established.

Third, the Board finds that there is competent, credible evidence linking the in-service injury (MST) to the current diagnosis of other specified trauma and stressor related disorder. Specifically, a December 2021 VA-obtained medical opinion reflects that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's diagnosis of other specified trauma and stressor related disorder was caused by or a result of the in-service MST event. See C&P Exam (December 2021). Therefore, the third element of service connection is met.

Given the above, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the evidence of record supports a finding that his other specified trauma and stressor related disorder is related to the incurrence of MST during his military service. 

Accordingly, the claim is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

The Board acknowledges that VA had also obtained negative medical opinions in April 2021 and November 2021. However, these opinions are inadequate for adjudicative purposes. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate). The April 2021 opinion is inadequate, as noted by the JMR, because it contained internally inconsistent statements as to whether the clinician found the MST likely did or did not occur based on the evidence. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). The November 2021 opinion is inadequate because the clinician essentially found that to opine on the incurrence of the Veteran's MST "would be mere speculation, " but did not provide an explanation.  See C&P Exam (November 2021). See also, Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 383, 390 (2010) (when an examiner states that they cannot offer an opinion without resorting to speculation, it must be clear that the examiner "considered all procurable and assembled data," and must explain that the inability to provide an opinion "reflect[s] the limitation of knowledge in the medical community at large" and not a limitation of the individual examiner). Therefore, these opinions were not considered and remand was not required as there was sufficient evidence to decide the claim. "[T]he duty to provide a medical examination is not automatic" and is not grounds for a "fishing expedition" for negative evidence. See Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80, 84-85 (2008).
