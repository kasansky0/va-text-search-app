ORDER

A total disability rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is granted.

Basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Service connection has been established for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rated 50 percent disabling; bilateral hearing loss rated 30 percent disabling; prostate cancer residuals with voiding dysfunction rated 20 percent disabling; and tinnitus rated 10 percent disabling.  The Veteran has a combined 80 percent service-connected rating.

2. In his July 2024 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that he last worked on a full-time basis in July 2010 as a laboratory technician and auctioneer.

3. The service-connected disabilities are of such severity to preclude the Veteran from securing and following substantially gainful employment.

4. Basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is established.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

2. The criteria for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 are met.  38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from December 1966 to December 1969.  He served in the Republic of Vietnam.

In November 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied a TDIU.  In December 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Veteran was notified of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal in December 2024.  In January 2025, the Board informed the Veteran of the opportunity to request a different review option by submitting a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, within 60 days of the January 2025 Board letter.  In February 2025, the Veteran waived his right to select a different Board review option.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). 

TDIU

The Veteran asserts that a TDIU is warranted as the service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure and follow any form of substantially gainful employment.

Total ratings for compensation purposes may be assigned where the combined schedular rating for the service-connected disabilities is less than 100 percent when it is found that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to make the veteran unemployable without regard to either advancing age or the presence of any nonservice connected disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341.

Total ratings for compensation purposes are assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  If there are two or more service-connected disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability must bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  The existence or degree of nonservice connected disabilities or previous unemployability status will be disregarded where the percentages for the service-connected disability or disabilities are met and in the judgment of the rating agency such service-connected disabilities render the veteran unemployable.  Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Service connection has been established for PTSD rated 50 percent disabling; bilateral hearing loss rated 30 percent disabling; prostate cancer residuals with voiding dysfunction rated 20 percent disabling; and tinnitus rated 10 percent disabling.  The Veteran has a combined 80 percent service-connected rating. Therefore, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for consideration of the assignment of a TDIU.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In his July 2024 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that he last worked on a full-time basis in July 2010 as both a laboratory technician and auctioneer.

The report of an August 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) psychiatric examination states that the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD.  The examiner noted that the service-connected PTSD "would likely impact his ability to function in an occupational environment."

The report of an August 2024 VA urinary tract examination states that the Veteran was diagnosed with prostate cancer residuals with voiding dysfunction.  The examiner commented that the service-connected voiding dysfunction impacted the Veteran's ability to work due to frequent nighttime voiding that interrupts sleep and daily activities.

The report of an August 2024 VA audiological examination states that the service connected bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus impacted ordinary conditions of daily life, including his ability to work.

The record is in at least equipoise as to whether the service-connected disabilities render the Veteran unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment during the relevant period.  The Veteran met the schedular criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) for consideration of a TDIU.  The Veteran reported that he last worked on a full-time basis in July 2010 as both a laboratory technician and auctioneer.  Upon resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Board has considered whether special monthly compensation at the housebound rate is warranted.  Entitlement to a TDIU based on the combined impact of the service-connected disabilities has been established. The Veteran does not have a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent or a TDIU due to a single disability and an additional service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability.  Therefore, an award of special monthly compensation at the housebound rate is not for assignment.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

Basic Eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance Benefits

Basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits exists where a Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and has a permanent and total service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021.  The Board has granted a TDIU.  Basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits is therefore established.
