CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue on appeal was resolved by administrative action, there remains no allegation of error of fact or law concerning the issue of eligibility to enroll in a VA Eligibility Priority Group higher than 6; the criteria for dismissal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1972 to November 1979. 

The decision on appeal was issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and found the Veteran eligible to enroll in Healthcare Eligibility Priority Group 6. 

In March 2021, a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, was received by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) that elected the Direct Review docket to review a February 2021 decisional letter that notified the Veteran that he was enrolled in the VA health care system in Priority Group 6 due to presumed herbicide exposure. He contended generally that there were other eligibility factors.  

The Board notes that while the appeal was pending, the AOJ processed claims for service connection filed by the Veteran. Effective from February 2020, he was in receipt of a 40 percent combined disability rating that resulted in enrollment in Priority Group 2. Enrollment records verify the Veteran's enrollment in Priority Group 2 based on his service-connected disability rating. Moreover, the Veteran currently has a combined disability evaluation of 100 percent, which provides eligibility to enroll in Priority Group 1. See April 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet. As such, the AOJ administratively granted the relief sought, enrollment in the VA health care system at the highest Eligibility Priority Group. As a result, there is no remaining allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration in the present appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.
