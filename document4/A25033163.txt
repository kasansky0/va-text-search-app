DOCKET NO. 240501-435950
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating more than 100 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's PTSD has been assigned a 100 percent rating, the maximum authorized under Diagnostic Code 9411.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There is no legal basis for the assignment of a schedular evaluation in excess of 100 percent for PTSD.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1981 to October 1984 and August 1990 to September 1991.? 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).? 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.? As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue on appeal.? See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.? The Board will not consider evidence received after the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182).? 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.? The Veteran has not filed such a request.

Higher evaluation for PTSD

The Veteran contends that he should be assigned a rating more than 100 percent for PTSD.  However, the Veteran has already been granted the 100 percent maximum schedular rating for PTSD.  There is no higher schedular rating that can be assigned for PTSD by regulation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.  In a case such as this one where the law and not the evidence is dispositive, entitlement to a higher schedular rating for the assignment of the 100 percent rating is denied because there is a lack of entitlement as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for CFS

The Veteran contends that he has CFS that is related to service, to include as due to his service in Southwest Asia.  The Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records do not document any complaints of or treatment for CFS or symptoms associated therewith.  However, his service personnel records verify his service in Southwest Asia.  Moreover, he has indicated current functional impairment related to CFS.

There is no medical opinion of record as to the etiology of the Veteran's claimed CFS.  In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran should be provided a VA examination on remand to determine such and the AOJ not providing such was a predecisional duty to assist error. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the etiology of his claimed CFS.  The claims folder must be made available to the examiner.  The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file. 

The examiner must provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran has CFS that is etiologically related to any period of active service to include his service in Southwest Asia.
