DOCKET NO. 240812-462729
DATE: April 9, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for duodenal ulcers is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's duodenal ulcers are proximately due to his service-connected right shoulder strain and/or knee strain.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for duodenal ulcers, as secondary to a right shoulder strain and/or knee strain, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1985 to August 2007.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the modernized review system, or Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2023 decision. In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 decision and identified a duty to assist error. Thereafter, the AOJ conducted additional development, and the claims were readjudicated in an August 2024 rating decision. The Veteran filed a timely appeal to this rating decision on a VA Form 10182 in August 2024. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for duodenal ulcers is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for duodenal ulcers from taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for his service-connected shoulder and knee strains. See March 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a)-(b). Secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (citations omitted). Secondary aggravation exists when the non-service-connected disability not caused by a service-connected disability would be less severe were it not for a service-connected disability. Id. at 1364. For example, secondary aggravation may be established where the natural progression of the non-service-connected disability could have been arrested or improved but for the service-connected disability. Id.

In the August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable findings that the Veteran has a current duodenal ulcer disability and that his claimed primary disability is service connected. The Board is bound by these favorable findings.

Therefore, the remaining question before the Board is if the Veteran's duodenal ulcers were either caused by or aggravated by his service-connected disability.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2023. The examiner opined that the Veteran's duodenal ulcers were less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected knee strain because there is no medical rationale to prove knee strain can lead to any gastrointestinal issues, including duodenal ulcers. The Veteran reported using NSAIDs for the pain, but there was no clear evidence to prove if he was taking NSAIDs or the amount he was taking. See April 2023 Medical Opinion Disability Benefits Questionnaire. However, the Veteran's medical records show the Veteran was prescribed both ibuprofen and meloxicam for his service-connected disabilities, both of which are NSAIDs. See Medical Records. Since this opinion was based on inaccurate information, the Board assigns it no probative value. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 (1993) (holding a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).

In May 2023, the VA provided an addendum opinion. The examiner stated that even though NSAIDs cause ulcers, there is no medical evidence to prove the Veteran took medication on a continuous basis. The examiner further stated that a negative nexus opinion was only rendered due to a lack of documented medication use. See May 2023 Addendum. However, the Veteran's medical records show the Veteran was prescribed both ibuprofen and meloxicam for continuous use for his service-connected disabilities, both of which are NSAIDs. See Medical Records. Since this opinion was based on inaccurate information, the Board assigns it no probative value. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 (1993) (holding a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).

The Veteran was afforded a second VA examination in December 2023. The examiner opined that the Veteran's duodenal ulcers were at least as likely as not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected conditions because a review of the Veteran's medical records show he was treated with NSAIDs for his knee and shoulder conditions. The examiner explained that medical literature shows that NSAIDs cause damage in the gastroduodenal mucosa. See December 2023 Medical Opinion Disability Benefits Questionnaire. The Board gives great probative weight to this opinion as it was based on a thorough consideration of the Veteran's statements and medical records and is supported by medical literature.

Taking all evidence into account and resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's duodenal ulcers were caused by his service-connected disabilities. Therefore, entitlement to service connection for duodenal ulcers is warranted, and the appeal is granted.
