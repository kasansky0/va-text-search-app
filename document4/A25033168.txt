ORDER

Entitlement to basic eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan guaranty benefits is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran served at least six credible years in the Reserves prior to her honorable discharge.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for basic eligibility for VA loan guaranty benefits have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3701, 3702; 38 C.F.R. § 3.315.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served from December 1983 to February 1990 in the United States Army Reserves, with active duty for training from May 1984 to September 1984.

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (to be codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C. § 5108, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA's) decision on their claim to seek review.  The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a February 2024 decisional letter by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

1. Entitlement to basic eligibility for VA loan guaranty benefits.

A certificate of eligibility for loan guaranty benefits is granted only to veterans who satisfy the basic entitlement criteria outlined in 38 U.S.C. §§ 3701 and 3702.  For this purpose, the term "veteran" includes any individual who has completed a total service of at least six years in the Selected Reserve and meets certain qualifying obligations following the completion of such service, or who was discharged or released from the Selected Reserve before completing six years of service because of a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3701(b)(5)(A).  The term "Selected Reserve" means the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of any of the reserve components (including the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States) of the Armed Forces.  38 U.S.C. § 3701(b)(5)(B).

In this case, the service personnel records show that the Veteran enlisted in the United States Army Reserves on December 28, 1983. The Veteran received an honorable discharge in February 1990.  See February 1990 Department of the Army Order.  The Veteran also had a period of active duty for training from May 1984 through September 1984.  See DD Form 214.

The Veteran asserts that she served six creditable years in the Reserves, and thus she is entitled to eligibility for loan guaranty benefits.

After a review of the evidence of record, the record sufficiently reflects that the Veteran served in the United States Army Reserves for at least six years, with regular participation in training and drills to confirm her status as a member of the Reserves throughout the six-year period, thereby fulfilling the six-year requirement for eligibility for VA loan guaranty benefits.  See Chronological Statement of Retirement Points.  Notably, in the February 2024 decision on appeal, the AOJ found that the Veteran had sufficient time as a Reserve member to meet the length of service requirement.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

The Veteran's claim was denied because it was found she did not receive an honorable discharge.  However, as reflected above, the Veteran received an honorable discharge in February 1990.  Thus, entitlement to loan guaranty benefits is granted.
