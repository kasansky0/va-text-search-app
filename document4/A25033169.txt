ORDER

The appeal for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to service-connected allergic rhinitis, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On November 19, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of the appeal for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to service-connected allergic rhinitis, is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2004 to July 2009.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The Veteran elected the Board's Direct Review docket. See May 2024 VA Form 10182. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

An effective withdrawal of a claim on appeal must be in writing, include the name of the veteran (or claimant or appellant if other than the veteran), the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 5-7 (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. Hembree, 33 Vet. App. 5. 

In the present case, the Veteran submitted a statement in November 2024 indicating that he desired to withdraw his appeal regarding the above-styled issue that was filed in the May 2024 VA Form 10182. See November 19, 2024, Correspondence. The Board notes that the AOJ granted service connection for obstructive sleep apnea on September 26, 2024. See September 2024 Rating Decision. However, given that the present appeal was still active at the time of the Veteran's November 2024 withdraw request, the Board will dismiss based upon the Veteran's request.
