2. The Veteran's hypertension is proximately due to his exposure to herbicide agents during active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309(e).

2.  The criteria for service connection for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 § 3373, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1986 to April 1986 and November 1986 to April 1987.  This matter is before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal and it was not considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for syncope, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection requires evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

The benefit of the doubt rule provides that a veteran will prevail in a case where the positive evidence is in approximate balance with the negative evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  It is only when the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the claim that the claim must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).    

1. Service connection for diabetes mellitus II is granted.

The Veteran is of the position that he has diabetes mellitus II as a result of his active service.

The Veteran was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus II during a VA examination in June 2023.  As such, the first element of service connection has been met.

The Veteran's military occupational specialty was aircraft airframe repair specialist.  The evidence includes an October 2023 Toxic Exposure Risk Activity memorandum indicating that Chanute Air Force base, where the Veteran served, was closed for improper disposal of various toxic chemicals, including herbicides.  Accordingly, the second element of service connection has been met.

During the Veteran's June 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted that there were several chemical exposures the Veteran possibly came into contact with during active duty.  The examiner quoted articles that stated that there is an association that is found between urinary antimony and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance.  The association was found among all participants and among participants without diabetes.  There is suggestive or a reasonably strong strength of association between chronic arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus.  

The examiner noted that the Veteran does not have and has never had strong risk factors for diabetes mellitus II such as obesity or a positive family history.  The examiner opined that since some of the chemicals that the Veteran was possibly exposed to during active service are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus II, the Veteran's disability is related to his indicated toxic exposure risk activities during service.

The Board affords high probative value to the June 2023 VA examination.  The opinion is well-reasoned, contains adequate rationale and is supported by research. 

The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is in support of the Veteran's claim.  As such, the Board finds that service connection for diabetes mellitus II is warranted.

2. Service connection for hypertension due to herbicide exposure is granted.

The Veteran is of the position that he has hypertension as a result of his active service, to include exposure to herbicide agents.  He filed his claim for service connection for hypertension on June 28, 2023.  The Board notes that he has not been afforded a VA examination for his disability.

The RO, in the February 2024 rating decision, found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with hypertension.  This is a favorable finding and favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board.  38 U. S. C. §5104A; 38?C.F.R. §?20.801.  Accordingly, the first element of service connection has been met.  

As previously stated, it has been conceded that the Veteran was exposed to herbicides during active service.  Accordingly, the second element of service connection has also been met.  

The diseases that are deemed associated with herbicide agent exposure under VA law are listed in 38 U.S.C. § 1116 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). 

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, was enacted on August 10, 2022. Section 404 of the PACT Act added hypertension to the list of diseases, which are presumptively related to exposure to herbicide agents. 

Based on the foregoing, the Veteran's hypertension is presumptively related to exposure to herbicide agents during service. Service connection for hypertension is granted.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for syncope is remanded.

The Veteran is of the position that he has syncope that is secondary to his diabetes mellitus II.  The Board notes that he has not been afforded a VA examination for his disability. The AOJ has attempted to schedule him for a VA examination for syncope specifically as secondary to diabetes.  The examination was canceled in November 2023 because the Veteran "relocated."  Prior to that date, the most recent address provided by the Veteran was in his July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ where he listed it as being in Corpus Christi, Texas.  The AOJ began to use a mailing address for an APO in Japan but the claims file does not document how this address was obtained. A July 2023 medical record noted that the Veteran worked as a sheet metal mechanic in Ikumi, Japan but no address was provided. The AOJ used a Postal Service Center (PSC) box at "FPO AP 96310-0017."  The letters to this address were returned to VA.  The AOJ attempted a second time to schedule the Veteran for an examination, noting that he lived outside the United States, and it was canceled in February 2024 with the reason being "Veteran unavailable."  However, the claims file does not contain documentation of any communication from the Veteran as to why he was unavailable, or whether there was any communication with him at all.  The rating decision on appeal stated that the Veteran "could not be contacted."  

The Board finds that the AOJ should have documented its attempts to schedule the Veteran for a VA examination more thoroughly.  The mailing address used was not the most recent address provided by the Veteran that was documented in the claims file, and it was returned to VA.  This is a predecisional duty to assist error and the AOJ should attempt to obtain the Veteran's current address and schedule him for an examination.  Because the AOJ requested an examination as to whether the Veteran's syncope was due to his diabetes, this is the opinion the AOJ should attempt to obtain on remand. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Contact the Veteran and determine his correct mailing address.  Attempts to contact him should be documented.  

2. After completing directive (1), schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the etiology of his syncope.  Attempts to schedule the examination should be documented.  

If the Veteran cannot be contacted or he is unable to attend an examination, provide the Veteran's claims file to an appropriate clinician so that a medical opinion may be provided.  The entire claims file and a copy of this remand must be made available to the examiner for review. . 

The clinician is asked to provide an opinion as to the following:

a. Is the Veteran's syncope related to his active service, including his exposure to herbicide agents?

b. Was the Veteran's syncope caused by his diabetes mellitus? 

c. Was the Veteran's syncope been aggravated by his diabetes mellitus?
