DOCKET NO. 210826-182017
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to service connection for a right knee condition is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

On March 7, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the Veteran that she wished to withdraw her appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1985 to March 1987, and October 1995 to August 1997, with additional periods of Reserve service.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).

The Veteran currently has two active appeals, under docket numbers 210826-182017, and 210826-182019; both appeal streams were initiated by separate VA Form 10182s, both received on August 26, 2021.

Here, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal. She submitted a written statement in March 2025, reporting that she did not want to go forward with her two appeals. On April 9, 2025, her representative sent an email to a Board employee confirming that she was canceling her scheduled Board hearing and did not want to pursue her claims.  The Veteran's written statement included her name and VA file number, and a statement indicating that he wished to withdraw the two separate claims, which are the only active appeal streams. The Board is thus satisfied that the Veteran's withdrawal document sufficiently communicated her wish to withdraw the current appeal. Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
