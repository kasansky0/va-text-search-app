ORDER

The November 23, 2023, request for an extension of time to file an appeal from a rating decision issued on December 14, 2017, that denied service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral hip degenerative joint disease, bilateral knee degenerative joint disease, lumbosacral disorder bulging disk and degenerative disk disease, left ankle disability to include sprain and degenerative joint disease, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At the time the Veteran submitted his November 23, 2023 Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182), there was not an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) decision to appeal. 

2. The claim for service connection for PTSD and major depressive disorder was granted in an August 2024 rating decision, which granted service connection for PTSD with anxiety and depression and assigned an initial 50 percent rating effective May 2, 2023. 

3. In August 2024, the Board remanded the claims for service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral hip degenerative joint disease, bilateral knee degenerative joint disease, lumbosacral disorder bulging disk and degenerative disk disease, and left ankle disability to include sprain and degenerative joint disease and they are currently pending in the Legacy system.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the November 23, 2023, request for an extension of time to file an appeal from a rating decision issued on December 7, 2017 have been met. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1965 to June 1968. On November 23, 2023, the Veteran filed a Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) seeking to appeal the Legacy rating decision issued on December 14, 2017. The Veteran asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal because of illness and depression and anxiety. The Veteran also submitted November 27, 2023 and May 7, 2024, VA form 10182s, attempting to appeal the issues in the December 7, 2017 Legacy rating decision and requested an extension of time to file an appeal. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. See 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105. 

Here, at the time of the November 23, 2023 Board Appeal request, no decision had been issued in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system to appeal. A rating decision issued in the Legacy system on December 14, 2017, denied service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, bilateral hip degenerative joint disease, bilateral knee degenerative joint disease, lumbosacral disorder bulging disk and degenerative disk disease, and left ankle disability to include sprain and degenerative joint disease and denied a temporary total rating based on treatment for a service-connected disability. The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement in the Legacy system on December 22, 2017. 

A the time of the November 23, 2023, Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182), and at the time of the May 7, 2024, Board Appeal request that asserted good cause to extend the time to file an appeal, the claims listed as being appealed were all still pending in the Legacy system. In fact, in August 2024, the Board remanded the Legacy claims for a Statement of the Case (SOC). 

The issues are still in the Legacy system and have not yet been returned to the Board. Thus, no extension of time is needed to file an appeal because the issues are all still on appeal and will be addressed by the Board in a Legacy decision if they are returned to the Board. The Board also notes that, regarding the claim for service connection for PTSD with depression and anxiety, the AOJ granted service connection in an August 2024 rating decision. 

Consequently, there is currently no case or controversy for active consideration by the Board on the November 23, 2023 attempted appeal of the Legacy rating decision issued on December 14, 2017 rating decision. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d. 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997); see also Shoen v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 456, 457 (1994). Therefore, the attempted appeal is dismissed as moot.
