REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to a single service-connected disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1996 to July 1998.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is grateful for her service  

This appeal arises under Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) from the Veteran's timely appeal of an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) September 2019 rating decision with election of the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) hearing docket.  Based on this election, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, additional evidence submitted on the date of the Board hearing (including testimony), and additional evidence submitted within 90 days of the hearing.  38 U.S.C. § 7113 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

The Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at a hearing conducted in September 2022.  A transcript of the hearing is of record.  

By a July 2023 decision, the Board granted the Veteran's appealed claim for TDIU.  However, the Veteran timely appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), and by an October 2024 Order the Court approved a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) and remanded the appeal for consideration of the claim for TDIU based on a single service-connected disability, since that may afford a higher, extraschedular rating.  The parties to the JMPR recognized that VA's duty to maximize the claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether her disabilities establish entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s). See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011). That statute provides for additional compensation if the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating and has additional disability ratable at 60 percent or higher.  This is addressed further, below.  

Regrettably, as discussed below, pre-decisional failure of the duty to assist based on failure to obtain relevant VA records necessitates remand.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c).

Entitlement to a TDIU due to a single service-connected disability is remanded.

The Veteran has been granted TDIU based on all service-connected disabilities, and the parties to the JMPR finds that it was error for the Board not to have considered unemployability due solely to the Veteran's service-connected migraine headaches for purposes of considering of entitlement to a SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).  

VA treatment records of record at the time of the appealed September 2019 rating decision included records associated with the claims file on July 9, 2019.  Among these records is a July 2019 treatment informing that the Veteran was beginning an Alpha-Stims treatment regime for her migraines which was to last multiple weeks.  However, no effort was made to obtain those records of Alpha-Stims treatment, which records were relevant to the nature, severity, and impact on work functioning of the Veteran's migraines at the time of the September 2019 rating decision.  Failure to seek those records was a pre-decisional failure of the duty to assist.  Under the AMA, the Board must remand to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors, including failure to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that all VA treatment records created within one year of a decision are constructively before the benefits adjudicator and that VA treatment records "are always reasonably related to a Veteran's claim." See Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

With the Veteran's authorization and assistance, as appropriate, obtain and associate with the claims file all pre-decisional VA treatment records or private treatment records not yet obtained, to include records of Alpha-Stims treatment for the Veteran's migraines.
