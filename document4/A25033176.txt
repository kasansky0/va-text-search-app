ORDER

Entitlement to individual unemployability based on a total disability rating (TDIU) from September 3, 2019, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, he was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities, effective September 3, 2019.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU from September 3, 2019, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty from December 1994 to May 2002.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2023 decision.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 decision.  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

TDIU

Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, in circumstances where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and that, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), a claim for a TDIU is part of a claim for an increased rating when such claim is expressly raised by the veteran or reasonably raised by the record. 

To establish entitlement to TDIU due to service-connected disabilities, there must be impairment so severe that it is impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or to the impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19 (2006); Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment for purposes of entitlement to TDIU. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Marginal employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. Consideration must be given in all claims to the nature of the employment and the reason for termination. Id.

Entitlement to individual unemployability based on a total disability rating (TDIU) from September 3, 2019, is granted.

The Veteran seeks an effective date of September 3, 2019, or earlier, for his award of a TDIU. See March 11, 2024, Informal Hearing Presentation.

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a TDIU, effective April 27, 2022.  However, the Veteran filed his VA 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability on January 10, 2023, during the course of his claim for a higher rating for his service-connected sinusitis and an initial service connection claim for obstructive sleep apnea.  Thus, if the effective date of the TDIU does not encompass the entire review period, it is a partial grant and TDIU remains in appellate status.  Harper v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 356 (2018). 

The question before the Board is whether the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date for his grant of a TDIU.

Prior to September 3, 2019, the Veteran had a total rating of 60 percent and was not eligible for a TDIU under the schedular criteria.

From September 3, 2019, to May 28, 2021, the Veteran was awarded service connection for the following disabilities: right knee medial meniscal tear with muscle atrophy rated as 40 percent disabling, lumbosacral strain rated as 40 percent disabling, sinusitis rated as 30 percent disabling, tinnitus rated as 10 percent disabling. His total rating was 80 percent.

From May 28, 2021, to April 27, 2022, the Veteran was rated for the following additional disabilities: sleep apnea rated as 50 percent disabling.  His total rating was then 90 percent.

From April 27, 2022, the Veteran was rated for the following additional disabilities: migraine headaches rated as 50 percent disabling.  His total rating was then 100 percent.

Therefore, the Veteran has met the schedular criteria for a TDIU since September 3, 2019.

By way of background, the Veteran filed his VA 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability on January 10, 2023.  This was during his continuously pursued increased rating claim for sinusitis, since May 26, 2021, and during his continuously pursued initial claim for sleep apnea submitted on December 26, 2019.  In June 2023, the Veteran was granted a 100 percent rating, effective April 27, 2022, and the AOJ denied his TDIU claim as moot prior to April 27, 2022.  

In his January 10, 2023, VA 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, the Veteran indicated that he last worked in 2012 as a sales distributor. The Veteran noted that he attended high school for four years, and college for one year. He indicated that he had healthcare training over a four year period since being too disabled to work. 

In an August 2018 VA examination for his knee, the Veteran reported that he tore his right knee meniscus, which he had surgery on in 2000 and 2002, but "the condition has gotten worse."  He further reported that he is "leary on stairs... and carrying extra weight."  The examiner found that the Veteran's functional impact included altered gait and preclusion of locking of the knee, transfers of weight, performing full squat position, and stair climbing.  

In a December 2018 VA examination for his back, the Veteran reported that he "had to give up the job because of [his] injury to his back."  The examiner noted that the Veteran "gets severe pain and parasthesia down his left leg... [and] is using a brace regularly.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's functional impact was that it is "difficult to sit prolonged, lift, [or] bend."

In a May 2019 VA examination for his sinusitis, the examiner noted that the Veteran has "headaches about 3 or 4 times a week lasting for a few hours."

Based on the evidence of record, and after resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that entitlement to a TDIU is warranted from September 3, 2019.

Significantly, weighing in favor of the Veteran's claim are the VA examination reports discussed above regarding the functional impairment associated with the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. Given the physical limitations associated with his service-connected right knee meniscal tear, including problems with altered gait and preclusion of locking of the knee, transfers of weight, performing full squat position, and stair climbing, it is unlikely that the Veteran would be able to obtain and maintain a physical labor position, to include a physical labor healthcare position. 

Moreover, given the symptoms associated with his service-connected lumbosacral strain and sinusitis described in the VA examination reports of record, including severe pain and parasthesia down his left leg and headaches about 3 or 4 times a week, it is unlikely the Veteran would be able to obtain a sedentary position consistent with his education and employment history or be qualified for any skilled position in the work force. Thus, the Board concludes that the functional impairment associated with the Veteran's service-connected disabilities likely prevented his ability to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment from September 3, 2019, the date that he met schedular eligibility for a TDIU.

In view of the foregoing, the Board finds that entitlement to a TDIU is warranted, effective September 3, 2019. The Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt rule in granting this benefit. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.
