ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 21, 2023, for the assignment of a 40 percent rating for service-connected lumbar strain, degenerative arthritis with spina bifida occulta L5 disability, (lumbar spine disability) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

There was not an active Intent to File when the Veteran filed her June 21, 2023, claim for an increased rating and a date is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability increased in severity within one year preceding VA's receipt of the June 21, 2021, VA form 21-526EZ.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for effective date prior to June 21, 2023, for the assignment of a 40 percent rating for the Veteran's lumbar spine disability, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242-5237.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Navy from December 2007 to December 2011. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2023 decision. In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2023 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 decision.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

General Effective Date and Claim Rules

Generally, the effective date for an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation based on an original claim is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

The general rule with respect to the effective date of an award of increased compensation is that the effective date of the award "shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application thereof." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). This statutory provision is implemented by regulation that provides that the effective date for an award of increased compensation will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). The purpose of this provision is to provide a one-year grace period for filing a claim following any increase in severity of a service-connected disability. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 983-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Stated conversely, the effective date of an increased rating is the date of ascertainable increase or date of receipt of the formal or informal claim, whichever is later under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). If, however, the ascertainable increase precedes receipt of the formal or informal claim, then the effective date is the date of ascertainable increase, if the claim is received within one year thereof under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(a); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997). 

The Board notes that VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014). The amendments, however, are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015. Prior to that date, the amendments are not applicable and the regulations in effect prior to March 24, 2015, will be applied.

VA will not recognize more than one Intent to File concurrently for the same benefit (e.g., compensation, pension). 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6). If an Intent to File has not been followed by a complete claim, a subsequent Intent to File regarding the same benefit received within 1 year of the prior Intent to File will have no effect. Id. If, however, VA receives an Intent to File followed by a complete claim and later another Intent to File for the same benefit is submitted within 1 year of the previous Intent to File, VA will recognize the subsequent Intent to File to establish an effective date for any award granted for the next complete claim, provided it is received within 1 year of the subsequent Intent to File. Id.  

Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 21, 2023, for the assignment of a 40 percent rating for the evaluation of lumbar strain, degenerative arthritis with spina bifida occulta L5 disability (lumbar spine disability), is denied.

Initially, the Board notes the Veteran does not assert entitlement to a rating in excess of the 40 percent rating for her service-connected lumbar spine disability on appeal. Rather, the issue on appeal focuses solely on the effective date assigned for the award of an increased rating for the Veteran's lumbar spine disability. See VBMS document titled, "VA form 10182, Notice of Disagreement," receipt date 06/19/2024.

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to an effective date prior to June 21, 2023, for assigment of the 40 percent rating for her service-connected lumbar spine disability. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that she is entitled to an effective date corresponding to a December 15, 2022, Intent to File form. In the alternative, the Veteran contends that she is entitled to and effective date corresponding to a May 25, 2023, Intent to File form. See VBMS document titled, "VA form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim," receipt date 12/07/2023; VBMS document titled, "VA form 20-0996, Request for Higher Level Review," receipt date, 11/07/2023.

The Board finds the most appropriate effective date for the Veteran's 40 percent rating for her lumbar spine disability is June 21, 2023, when VA received the Veteran's fully developed claim for an increased rating.

By way of history, the Veteran was initially granted service connection for a lumbar spine disability in March 2015. The AOJ assigned a 10 percent rating effective April 26, 2013. 

More than four years after the March 2015 rating decision, VA received an Intent to File on May 15, 2019. A formal claim for benefits was not received within one year of the May 2019 Intent to File. 

Nearly two years after the intent to file, on April 10, 2021, VA received an Intent to File concurrently with a VA Form 21-526EZ claim for an increased rating for her service-connected lumbar spine disability. The AOJ granted the Veteran's claim in a June 2021 rating decision. 

Next, on March 25, 2022, VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ claim for service connection for a mental health condition, a sleep condition, nerve condition of bilateral upper and lower extremities, and a neck condition which the Veteran claims as due to her service-connected lumbar spine disability. No Intent to File form was received with the March 2022 claim for service connection. In a September 19, 2022, rating decision, the AOJ deferred a decision for the Veteran's claimed neck condition and denied service connection for a mental health condition, sleep condition, and a nerve condition of the bilateral upper and lower extremities. On October 20, 2022, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for a neck condition.

The September 2022 rating decision also proposed to reduce the 20 percent rating to 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine disability. 

On December 15, 2022, VA received an Intent to File for compensation. 

In a January 3, 2023, rating decision, the AOJ effectuated the proposed reduction, and decreased the Veteran's rating to 10 percent for the service-connected lumbar spine disability, to become effective April 1, 2023, which is the first of the following month in which the 60-day period from the date of notice of the final rating action. 

On May 25, 2023, VA received a second VA form 21-0966, Intent to File for compensation. The Board notes that no claim for benefits was received between the December 15, 2022, Intent to File and the May 25, 2022, VA form 21-0966, Intent to File form. 

Then, on June 15, 2023, VA received VA form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, requesting review of the October 2022 AOJ decision which denied service connection for a cervical spine condition. 

Next, on June 21, 2023, VA received VA form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for an increased rating for her lumbar spine disability. 

On July 24, 2023, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for a neck condition.

On September 27, 2023, the AOJ granted the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for her service-connected lumbar spine disability. The effective date assigned for the increased ratings was June 21, 2023, based on the date of receipt of the increased rating claim.

In the Veteran's November 2023 Request for higher level review, her attorney argued that an earlier effective date for the increased rating award is warranted based on the date of receipt of her May 2023 Intent to File. Specifically, it was contended that because there was an Intent to File submitted on May 25, 2023, and the VA Form 21-526EZ was submitted on June 21, 2023, the effective date should be May 25, 2023. See VBMS documents titled, "VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher Level Review," received 11/07/2023. In the March 2024 higher level review rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied an earlier effective date for the Veteran's increased rating award, explaining that the Veteran's Intent to File was received on May 25, 2023; however, as a claim received prior to June 21, 2023 was associated with her Intent to File that did not include her increased rating claim, the effective date for the award of the increased rating is June 21, 2023, the date the claim were received.

In December 2023, the Veteran's attorney argued that the effective date for the increased rating should correspond to the December 15, 2022, Intent to File. The attorney argued that the December 15, 2022, Intent to File was "still active" when the May 25, 2023, Intent to File was received; thus, the May 25, 2023, Intent to File had no effect and the proper effective date of the increase is December 15, 2022. See VBMS document titled, "VA 21-4138," receipt date 12/07/2023.

In argument submitted with his June 2024 NOD (VA Form 10182), the Veteran's attorney again argued the proper effective date is May 25, 2023, the date of the second Intent to File, because the June 15, 2022 Supplemental Claim for a neck condition was "part of a claim stream under continuous pursuit" and the "ITF [Intent to File] cannot be subsumed by the 20-0995 [Supplemental Claim] when still within the one year appeal period (e.g., when continuous pursuit is still applicable). Such a finding is illogical and contrary to the holding in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs." The attorney argued that the Intent to File is inapplicable to situations governing administrative review within one year because a claim has already been filed; thus, "there is no need to notify VA that you need to file a claim because the claim has already been filed. In summary, the attorney argued that the Intent to File is "superfluous and inapplicable" in the Veteran's claim for service-connection for a neck condition because that claim falls within continuous pursuit under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a). See VBMS document titled, "VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement," receipt date 06/19/2024.

After reviewing the relevant laws, regulations, however, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted in this matter.

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the May 25, 2023, Intent to File, has no effect on either the service connection or increased rating claims. Notably and applicable here, VA will not recognize more than one Intent to File concurrently for the same benefit (e.g., compensation, pension). If an Intent to File has not been followed by a completed claim application, a subsequent Intent to File regarding the same benefit received within one year of the prior Intent to File will have no effect. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6). The December 15, 2022, Intent to File was followed within one year by the May 25, 2023, Intent to File, and not a completed claim. Thus, the May 25, 2023, Intent to File has no effect on any claim for compensation, to include both the June 15, 2023, claim for service connection and the June 21, 2023, claim for an increased rating. 

That still leaves the matter of the December 15, 2022, Intent to File. While the Board agrees with the Veteran's attorney that the December 15, 2022, Intent to File was the active Intent to File, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim must be denied because the December 15, 2022, Intent to File was not an active pending Intent to File at the time of the June 21, 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ. 

As explained by the AOJ in its March 2024 HLR decision, following the filing of the December 2022 Intent to File, the Veteran's supplemental claim was received on June 15, 2023; thus, prior to June 21, 2023, fully developed claim. When the Veteran filed that June 15, 2023, Supplemental Claim, the December 15, 2022, Intent to File attached to that claim.

More importantly, the laws and regulations do not support the contention by the Veteran's attorney that an Intent to File does not apply to the June 15, 2023, Supplemental Claim because it was "part of a claim stream under continuous pursuit" and the "ITF [Intent to File] cannot be subsumed by the 20-0995 [Supplemental Claim] when still within the one year appeal period (e.g., when continuous pursuit is still applicable)."

In this regard, it is noted that, in implementing the AMA, the preamble to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 specifically precluded application of the Intent to File provisions for supplemental claims. However, in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (2021), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) found 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 invalid to the extent it excluded supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework. Accordingly, supplemental claims are no longer excluded from the Intent to File framework under the AMA.

As noted by the Federal Circuit, several statutory provisions form the basis for the regulations at issue here. "...38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a) and § 5104C(b) recite a claimant's options for administrative review following an AOJ decision, including the filing of a supplemental claim. Section 5104C(a) governs administrative review 'within one year' of an AOJ decision, whereas § 5104C(b) governs administrative review after 'more than one year has passed.'" See Military-Veterans Advocacy, at 1133-34.

In this case, the Veteran's June 2023 Supplemental Claim was the type of supplemental claim contemplated by 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a). Although the Board recognizes that there is a difference between the two types of supplemental claims, and that the June 2023 Supplemental Claim was filed to continuously pursue the claim of service connection for a neck condition, these differences do not obviate the fact that when the Federal Circuit held that the Intent to File framework applied to supplemental claims under the AMA, it did not distinguish between the two types of supplemental claims.

Notably, as was discussed in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, when VA originally drafted 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 to exclude supplemental claims from the Intent to File framework, it had stated that AMA's amendments to 38 U.S.C. § 5110 required differential treatment of initial and supplemental claims. See 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 142 (Jan. 18, 2019). Specifically, VA stated that applying the Intent to File framework to supplemental claims "would allow for supplemental claim[s] [submitted] beyond the one-year period" to retain an earlier effective date, contrary to 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(3)'s requirement that the effective date of such supplemental claims "shall not be earlier than the date of receipt." See Military-Veterans Advocacy, at 1133-34.

Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) argued before the Federal Circuit that this regulation was arbitrary and capricious because:  VA interprets "virtually identical" statutory language in § 5110(a)(1) and § 5110(a)(3) inconsistently. Section 5110(a)(3) states that the effective date of § 5104C(b) supplemental claims "shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim," and § 5110(a)(1) likewise requires that the effective date of an initial claim "shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor." It thus makes little sense, PVA contended, for VA to interpret this substantially similar language to forbid an intent-to-file submission in one instance but not another. PVA also argues that VA's explanation for this rule runs counter to another regulatory provision that permits claimants who have filed an incomplete supplemental claim form to retain that filing date as their effective date so long as they submit a complete supplemental claim form within 60 days. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i) ("Upon receipt of a communication indicating a belief in entitlement to benefits that is submitted... on a supplemental claim form... that is not complete," the Secretary "shall notify the claimant... of the information necessary to complete the application form" and "[i]f VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim."). See Military-Veterans Advocacy, at 1146.

In response to this challenge (but without conceding that this challenge was meritorious), the government requested that the Federal Circuit dismiss and remand the challenge back to VA so that VA could propose a regulation to amend 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 such that the Intent to File framework rule would apply to 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(b) supplemental claims, i.e., those filed more than one year after a decision. See Military-Veterans Advocacy, at 1146.

The Federal Circuit declined the government's request for a voluntary remand and otherwise agreed with PVA's challenge that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155's exclusion of supplemental claims from the Intent to File framework was arbitrary and capricious. See id. at 1146-47. Again, the Board highlights that while VA sought to limit the Intent to File framework to those supplemental claims that are filed more than one year after a decision, the holding in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (2021), found the Intent to File framework applicable to all supplemental claims, regardless of whether it is the type of supplemental claim filed to continuously pursue a claim or issue under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) or whether it is the type of supplemental claim filed to seek readjudication of a claim or issue that was decided more than one year earlier.

Although it may seem illogical on its face to apply the Intent to File framework to a supplemental claim filed in response to a rating decision to continuously pursue a claim or issue, as argued by the Veteran's attorney, it must be observed that as a result of the Federal Circuit's decision, VA will now allow an Intent to File filed within one year of notification of a VA decision to operate to maintain continuous pursuit if the Intent to File is followed by a complete supplemental claim, even if the supplemental claim is filed after the one-year period following notice of a decision. Thus, in certain cases, applying the Intent to File framework to a 38 C.F.R. § 5104C(a) supplemental claim would be favorable for a veteran.

The Board has considered the Veteran's contentions. However, as discussed above, the laws and regulations make clear that the Intent to File framework applies to all supplemental claims. Moreover, according to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii), if VA receives a complete claim within one year of filing an Intent to File that meets the requirements of § 3.155(b), it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the Intent to File. Additionally, if more than one complete claim for a benefit is filed within one year of an Intent to File, only the first claim filed will be associated with the Intent to File a claim. Id. Accordingly, any open Intent to File will be absorbed by the next valid claim that is received.

As outlined above, the Veteran's June 2023 Supplemental Claim for service connection for a neck condition was the first claim received following the December 2022 Intent to File. Therefore, the December 2022 Intent to File was not available to attach to the VA Form 21-526EZ increased rating claim received on June 21, 2023. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's award of increased ratings for her lumbar spine disability was properly assigned effective from June 21, 2023, the date of receipt of her June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ increased rating claim.

As the evidence is persuasively against the award of an earlier effective date, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable and the appeal as to this claim is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
