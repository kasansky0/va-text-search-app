REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active duty service from May 1968 to April 1970.

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the increased rating claims, to include the issue of entitlement to a TDIU pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), most recently addressed in a November 2022 rating decision. The Veteran has continuously pursued the initial ratings assigned for these service-connected disabilities since rating decision were issued in October 2021, November 2021, and May 2022 establishing service connection. See September 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Request for Higher-Level Review. 

In April 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal. In the November 26, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. He waived his right to switch dockets in an attachment also received on November 26, 2024. See Williams v. McDonough, No. 21-7363 (June 21, 2024). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. 

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence it could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to an initial rating higher than 30 percent for major depressive disorder prior to March 28, 2024, is remanded.

2. Entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for major depressive disorder as of March 28, 2024, is remanded.

3. Entitlement to an initial rating higher than 20 percent for residuals of prostate cancer is remanded.

4. Entitlement to an initial rating higher than 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy prior to March 28, 2024, is remanded.

5. Entitlement to a rating higher than 20 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy as of March 28, 2024, is remanded.

6. Entitlement to an initial rating higher than 20 percent for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease is remanded.

7. Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

Prior to the April 2024 rating decision on appeal, VA treatment records reference documents that were scanned into VistA Imaging. Since the Board cannot establish that these scanned documents are not relevant to any of the issues on appeal, and since the Board has no access to documents in this repository, a duty to assist error was committed by not obtaining the Veteran's complete record of treatment stored in VistA Imaging. A remand is required to allow VA to obtain these records.

In addition, a March 2024 VA treatment record references that a VA provider was going to request records related to the Veteran's lower back disability from Kaiser Permanente. A remand is required to allow VA to obtain these records.

The claim for entitlement to a TDIU is inextricably intertwined with the claims for increased ratings being remanded; however, the Board also finds that there was a pre-decisional duty to assist error in not referring entitlement to a TDIU prior to March 28, 2024, for extraschedular consideration pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) since the Veteran raised entitlement to a TDIU pursuant to Rice in the September 2023 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the Veteran's complete record of treatment scanned into VistA Imaging; if records requested from Kaiser Permanente in March 2024 are not included, a request for those records should be made separately.

2. Refer the Veteran's claim for a TDIU to VA's Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration.
