DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a 100 percent evaluation from July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023, for service-connected ischemic heart disease with angina status post myocardial infarction and bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker (heart disability) is granted.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 70 percent for service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected scar of the left subclavian anterior trunk (left trunk scar) is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 1, 2020 for the grant of service connection for a left trunk scar is denied.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance is denied. 

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate from July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023 is granted.

The claim of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) based solely on the service-connected heart disability is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's heart disability demonstrated metabolic equivalent (MET) testing that shows that a workload of 1 to 3 METs resulting in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, and dizziness.  

2. The severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms associated with service-connected PTSD did not more closely approximate total occupational and social impairment.

3. The Veteran's tinnitus is rated at the maximum schedular rating under Diagnostic Code 6260.   

4. Veteran's bilateral hearing has been manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level III in the right ear and no worse than Level III in the left ear.

5. The Veteran's left trunk scar measures 5 or 5.5 centimeters by .2 centimeters.

6. The Veteran had pacemaker implantation due to his service-connected heart disability in November 2018; his left trunk scar is a result of that surgery.

7. The AOJ received a claim for service connection for a heart disability on October 16, 2020. 

8. Basic eligibility to DEA benefits has been in effect since April 24, 2018.  

9. From July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023, the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent (heart disability) with additional disability independently ratable at 60 percent (PTSD, hearing loss, tinnitus), involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems.

10. Entitlement to TDIU due solely to the service-connected heart disability is moot.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a 100 percent rating the service-connected heart disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.100, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7006.

2. The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for service-connected PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

3. The Veteran's criteria for a rating for in excess of 10 percent for service-connected bilateral tinnitus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(b), 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.87 Diagnostic Code 6260.

4. The criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

5. The criteria for a compensable disability rating for a left trunk scar have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

6. The criteria for an effective date earlier than July 1, 2020 for the grant of service connection for a left trunk scar have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, 3.2500.

7. The criteria for an earlier effective date for the grant of DEA have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, 3.2500.

8. The criteria for SMC at the housebound rate from July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023 is met by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

9. The claim of TDIU based solely on the service-connected heart disability during the relevant review period is moot.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.16; Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1967 to June 1970 and from February 1974 to September 1976.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued on October 29, 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  The AMA automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 10, 2023, decision.  See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (July 2023); Rating Decision (June 2023).  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 decision.  See Rating Decision (October 2023); Rating Decision (June 2023).  

In the October 22, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (October 2024).  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 21, 2023, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Evaluations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3. 

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of any disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  Although the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings, the Board is to consider the Veteran's medical history in determining the applicability of a higher rating for the entire period in which the appeal has been pending.  Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999). 

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous."  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time.  Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings).  When adjudicating a claim for an increased initial evaluation, the relevant time period is from the date of the claim.  Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 215 (2007), rev'd in irrelevant part, Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (2009).  When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed.  Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509. 

1. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent from July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023, for service-connected heart disability.

On April 24, 2018, the AOJ received a claim for service connection for a heart disability.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (April 2018).  A June 2018 legacy rating decision granted service connection for a heart disability, assigning a 100 percent evaluation, effective April 24, 2018.  See Rating Decision (June 2018).  The Veteran did not appeal and or submit new and material evidence within one year and the rating decision is thus final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.  

In July 2019, based on review of conflicting medical evidence regarding whether the Veteran had a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, the AOJ proposed to sever service connection based on a clear and unmistakable error.  See Rating Decision (July 2019). An April 2020 AMA rating decision severed service connection for the heart disability, effective July 1, 2020.  See Rating Decision (April 2020).  On October 16, 2020, the AOJ received a supplemental claim to restore service connection for the heart disability.  See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (October 2020).  An October 2020 rating decision confirmed and continued the severance.  See Rating Decision (October 2020).  In November 2020, the AOJ received the Veteran's request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) review of the October 2020 rating decision.  See VA Form 20-0996 (November 2020).  An April 16, 2021, supplemental rating decision identified a difference of opinion, but ultimately continued the denial of service connection for a heart disability.  See Rating Decision (March 2021); VA Form 20-0999 (March 2021); Rating Decision (April 2021).  

On April 11, 2022, within one year of the April 2021 rating decision, the AOJ received the Veteran's request for HLR of  the April 2021 rating decision.  See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (April 2022).  In May 2022, the AOJ determined there was a duty to assist error and that a medical opinion was required.  See Rating Decision (May 2022).  The issue was transferred to the supplemental claim lane.  See Rating Decision (July 2022).  In a July 14, 2022, rating decision, the AOJ restored service connection for the heart disability and assigned a 30 percent evaluation, effective July 1, 2020.  See Rating Decision (July 2022).  

On March 3, 2023, the AOJ received a supplemental claim for an increased evaluation for the service-connected heart disability.  See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (March 2023).  A June 21, 2023, rating decision granted a 100 percent evaluation for the heart disability, effective March 3, 2023.  See Rating Decision (June 2023).  In July 2023, the AOJ received a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, and requested review of the June 2023 rating decision, to include an increased rating for the heart disability for all periods on appeal.  See VA Form 20-0996 (July 2023).  In October 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal that denied an evaluation in excess of 100 percent for the service-connected heart disability.  See Rating Decision (October 2023).  This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (October 2024).  

The Board notes that the initial claim of entitlement to an increased evaluation for the heart disability was received by the AOJ on March 3, 2023; the Veteran, however, had continuously prosecuted the claim of restoration of service connection since the October 2020 supplemental claim.  The Board thus finds that the relevant rating review period begins on October 16, 2020, the date of the claim of restoration of service connection for the heart disability, as there was continuous prosecution of the claim since that time; and ends on June 21, 2023, the date of the rating decision that was later subject to Higher Level Review. 

For this time period, the Veteran's heart disability is rated under DC 7006 for myocardial infarction.  The Veteran's diagnosis was bradycardia, implanted cardiac pacemaker, and ischemic heart disease with myocardial infarction.  See C&P Exam at 2 (April 2023).

Effective November 14, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for cardiovascular disease under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7005.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities:  The Cardiovascular System, 86 Fed. Reg. 54089 (Sep. 30, 2021).  This amended regulation applies to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after November 14, 2021.  Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both the pre- and post-amendment rating criteria, and whichever is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied.  However, the Board may not apply the post-amendment rating criteria to a period prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  Conversely, the Board is not precluded from applying the pre-amendment rating criteria to a period on or after the effective date of the post-amendment rating criteria so long as it was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

Prior to November 14, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7006, for myocardial infarction, a 10 percent rating is warranted where a workload of greater than 7.0 metabolic equivalents (METs) but not greater than 10.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or continuous medication is required.  A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of greater than 5.0 METs but not greater than 7.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray.  A 60 percent rating is warranted where there is more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year, or a workload of greater than 3.0 METs but not greater than 5.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent.  A 100 percent rating is warranted where there is chronic congestive heart failure, or a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent.

Under the pre-amendment rating criteria, one MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2).  When the level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope may be used.  Id.

For the purposes of a 60 percent evaluation, the pre-amendment rating criteria do not require a separate showing of left ventricular dysfunction in addition to an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent.  Otero-Castro v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 375, 382 (2002).  Additionally, the phrase "30 to 50 percent" means 30 percent through 50 percent.  Id. at 380.  For the purposes of a 100 percent evaluation, the pre-amendment rating criteria do not require a separate showing of left ventricular dysfunction in addition to an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent.  See Otero-Castro, 16 Vet. App. at 382.

Effective November 14, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7006, myocardial infarction is rated in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart.  A 10 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 7.1-10.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or continuous medication is required for control.  A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multigated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging).  A 60 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms.  A 100 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.

Under the post-amendment rating criteria, one MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2).  When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms may be used.  Id.

For purposes of the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart, heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (3).

Considering all relevant evidence of record, the Board finds that a 100 percent evaluation is for assignment for the rating review period.  In 2021 and 2023 VA-obtained Heart Conditions examination reports, it was noted that interview-based METs testing was conducted because stress testing is not required as a part of the Veteran's current treatment plan and this test is not without significant risk.  See C&P Exam at 12 (March 2021); C&P Exam at 7 (April 2023); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.1000.  The 2021 VA examination report contained interview-based METs testing resulting in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, and dizziness at 1-3 METs, consistent with activities such as eating, dressing, taking a shower, and slow walking for 1 to 2 blocks.  See C&P Exam at 12 (March 2021).  In a March 2023 VA-obtained Heart Conditions examination report, interview based METs testing showed breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, and syncope at 1 to 3 METs, which is consistent with activities such as eating, dressing, taking a shower, slow walking for 1 to 2 blocks.  See C&P Exam at 8 (April 2023).  These findings support a 100 percent evaluation, under either version of the diagnostic criteria.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005.  

It appears that the AOJ assigned the 30 percent evaluation for the rating review period based on the 2021 VA-obtained report, in which a clinician stated that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 70% and was the most objective reflection of the current cardiac status.  See C&P Exam at 11, 13 (March 2021).  But the clinician provided no explanation for this finding.  Furthermore, neither the 2018 nor 2023 VA-obtained examination reports found that LVEF was the most objective reflection of cardiac status.  Without more, and resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board will not rely on this conclusion without an explanation.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (noting that a medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two).  Likewise, in a June 2022 VA-obtained opinion report, a clinician determined that the Veteran's METs score due solely to cardiac function would be 5-7 METs.  See C&P Exam at 4 (June 2022).  This statement implied that the METs score would be lower if other disabilities were considered, but did not provide any further explanation.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 301.  Notably, the 2021 and the 2023 VA-obtained examination reports found 1-3 METs and both were based on an in-person examination, unlike the June 2022 medical opinion.  See C&P Exam (March 2021); C&P Exam (March 2023); C&P Exam (June 2022).  The Board assigns more probative value to the findings of the clinicians who personally examined the Veteran.  Accordingly, a 100 percent evaluation is for assignment.  

As the maximum evaluation for a service-connected disability is assigned herein, no other potentially applicable diagnostic codes have been considered.  See e.g., Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 592-93 (1991) (holding that the Board must consider all potentially applicable regulatory provisions).  As to separate evaluations, the Veteran's left trunk scar is separately service-connected and the evidence of record does not demonstrate other related conditions. 

Accordingly, the claim is granted.

2. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 70 percent for service-connected PTSD.

A September 2016 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD, and assigned a 50 percent evaluation, effective March 7, 2016.  See Rating Decision (September 2016).  

On March 3, 2023, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA 21-8940 claim for TDIU, from which a claim for increase was inferred.  See VA 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Individual Unemployability (March 2023).  A June 21, 2023 rating decision granted a 70 percent evaluation for PTSD, effective March 3, 2023.  See Rating Decision (June 2023).  In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the June 2023 rating decision.  See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (July 2023).  In October 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal.  See Rating Decision (October 2023).  This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (October 2024).  Thus, the relevant rating review period begins on March 3, 2023, with a one year look back, which is the date VA received the TDIU claim from which the increased evaluation claim was inferred; and ends on June 21, 2023, the date of the rating decision that was later subject to Higher Level Review. 

The Board concludes that the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 70 percent for service-connected PTSD are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages.  Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating.  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

The issue in this appeal is whether the Veteran's associated symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 100 percent.

A noncompensable rating is assigned when a mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough to either require continuous medication, or to interfere with occupational and social functioning.

A 10 percent rating is assigned when mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of occasional stress, or symptoms controlled by medication cause occupational and social impairment.

A 30 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, or mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events), cause occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation).

A 50 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.

The Board finds that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms associated with service-connected PTSD did not more closely approximate total occupational and social impairment.

VA treatment records, the March 2023 VA examination report, and the Veteran's lay statements show that the Veteran's PTSD was manifested by symptoms associated with a 70 percent rating, including obsessive rituals; near continuous panic or depression that affects the ability to functional independently, appropriately, and effectively; and the inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  See C&P Exam at 5 (March 2023). The Veteran's PTSD was also manifested by symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating, such as a flattened affect; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); and difficulty in understanding complex commands.  See C&P Exam at 5-6 (March 2023).  Additionally, the Veteran's PTSD was also manifested by symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating, such as mild memory loss (forgetting directions); chronic sleep impairment; depressed mood; and anxiety.  See C&P Exam at 5 (March 2023); CAPRI at 48 (May 2022); VAMC Report of Hospitalization at 56 (March 2023).

Notably, none of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms were associated with a 100 percent rating.  See e.g., CAPRI (July 2022); VAMC Report of Hospitalization (March 2023); C&P Exam (March 2023).  Rather, the March 2023 clinician found there was not persistent danger of hurting self or others, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, disorientation to time or place, grossly inappropriate behavior, or persistent delusions or hallucinations.  See C&P Exam at 5 (March 2023).  Moreover, the Veteran denied suicidal and homicidal ideations.  See CAPRI at 48, 51 (May 2022); VAMC Report of Hospitalization at 56, 90, 93 (March 2023).

The Veteran also had PTSD symptoms that are not listed with a specific rating, such as poor energy, preoccupation, confusion about driving at night, an inability to relax, and intrusive memories.  See C&P Exam at 3 (March 2023).  The Veteran also reported distress with reminding cues, recurrent dreams, and persistent avoidance of stimuli that remind of trauma.  See CAPRI at 48 (May 2022); VAMC Report of Hospitalization at 90 (March 2023).  The Board finds the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's unlisted symptoms more closely approximate the symptoms contemplated by a 70 percent rating or lower disability rating, as they are less severe, less frequent, and shorter in duration than those contemplated by a 100 percent rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126. For instance, unlisted symptoms of avoidance, intrusive memories, confusion about driving, an inability to relax, and distress with trauma reminders are at worst symptoms that are similar to impaired judgement, thinking, and mood, which is contemplated by the 70 percent rating criteria. Unlisted symptoms of preoccupation are similar to impaired judgement, which is associated with a 50 percent rating. Unlisted symptoms of recurrent dreams and poor energy are similar to chronic sleep impairment and depressed mood, respectively, which is associated with a 30 percent rating. Thus, the unlisted symptoms do not tend to support that the Veteran has total occupational and social impairment due to his symptoms, which are contemplated by the 70 percent or lower rating criteria.

Although the Veteran provided lay evidence regarding the effects of his psychiatric medications, the Board notes that the plain language of the criteria for a 10 percent rating under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders specifically contemplates the effects of medication.  Consequently, Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012) does not apply, and the Board's evaluation of the Veteran's PTSD may include the ameliorative effects of medication.  See McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271-73 (2016).

Accordingly, the claim is denied.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 70 percent for service-connected PTSD, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

3. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus.

A September 2016 rating decision granted service connection for tinnitus, and assigned a 10 percent evaluation, effective March 7, 2016.  See Rating Decision (September 2016).  

On March 3, 2023, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA 21-8940 claim for TDIU, from which a claim for increase was inferred.  See VA 21-8940 (March 2023).  A June 21, 2023 rating decision denied an increased evaluation for tinnitus.  See Rating Decision (June 2023).  In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the June 2023 rating decision.  See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (July 2023).  In October 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal.  See Rating Decision (October 2023).  This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (October 2024).  The Veteran's attorney list this issue in his supporting brief yet neither provides argument nor identifies evidence to support a higher rating.

The Board concludes that there is no legal basis for the assignment of either a higher single evaluation for tinnitus or separate 10 percent disability ratings for the tinnitus of each ear. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260; Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d. 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Tinnitus is rated in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260. That diagnostic code provides a maximum 10 percent evaluation for recurrent tinnitus. Only a single evaluation is warranted for tinnitus, whether the sound is perceived in one ear, both ears, or in the head. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260, Note 2; VAOPGCPREC 2-03.The Veteran's tinnitus is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260. 

The April 2023 VA examination report reflects the Veteran's report that his tinnitus doesn't really bother him other than at night when trying to sleep.  See C&P Exam at 5 (April 2023).  His symptoms of tinnitus, noise in ears, is contemplated by the current 10 percent rating regardless of whether it occurs in the daytime or nighttime. Further, even assuming arguendo that the Veteran has some sleep impairment as due to tinnitus, he is already compensated for sleep impairment as part of his rating for his service-connected mental disorder and a separate rating would violate the against pyramiding. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 ; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

Accordingly, as the Veteran has the maximum schedular rating for tinnitus, the claim for increase is denied as a matter of law. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

4. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected bilateral hearing loss.

A September 2016 rating decision granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss, and assigned a zero percent evaluation, effective March 7, 2016.  See Rating Decision (September 2016).  On April 24, 2018, the AOJ received a claim for an increased evaluation for bilateral hearing loss.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (April 2018).  In June 2018, the AOJ denied an increased evaluation for hearing loss.  See Rating Decision (June 2018).  

On September 20, 2022, the AOJ received a claim for increase for bilateral hearing loss.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (September 2022).  In November 2022, the AOJ denied an increased evaluation for hearing loss.  See Rating Decision (November 2022).  

On March 3, 2023, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA 21-8940 Claim for TDIU, from which a claim for increase was inferred.  See VA 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Individual Unemployability (March 2023).  The Veteran listed the disabilities which he believed cause his unemployability; those disabilities included hearing loss.  See VA 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Individual Unemployability (March 2023).  The TDIU claim is considered a supplemental claim because an increased evaluation for hearing loss was adjudicated in a rating decision within one year of this request for a TDIU, which was based in part on his bilateral hearing loss.  See Rating Decision (November 2022); Chisholm v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, __ Vet. App. __ (Mar. 13, 2025).  A June 2023 rating decision denied an increased evaluation for the service-connected hearing loss.  See Rating Decision (June 2023).  In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, and requested review of the June 2023 rating decision.  See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (July 2023).  In October 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal.  See Rating Decision (October 2023).  This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (October 2024).  

The relevant rating review period begins on September 20, 2022, with a one year look back; and ends on June 21, 2023, the date of the rating decision that was later subject to Higher Level Review.  

The Board concludes that the criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz).  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII.  

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

An October 2022 VA examination reveals the Veteran reported difficulty hearing which affected his ability to communicate and required him to ask people to repeat themselves.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10; Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007).  He also reported he has to turn the TV up loud to hear it.  See C&P Exam at 6 (November 2022).  The Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:  

	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	25	45	60	75	51	98%

LEFT	25	40	45	65	44	96%

An April 2023 VA examination reveals that the Veteran reported difficulty understanding and hearing in all situations.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10; Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007).  The Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:  

	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	30	45	55	65	48.75	76%

LEFT	35	40	50	70	48.75	76%

See C&P Exam at 2 (April 2023).  The audiologist stated that the Veteran's mild-moderate hearing loss causes difficulty communicating over the telephone, unable to hear alarms, and will not be able to understand normal conversation in background noise even with hearing aids.  See C&P Exam at 5 (April 2023).

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield numeric designation of Levels I and III in the right ear and Levels I and III in the left ear.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level III for the right ear and Level III for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a zero percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

Based on the evidence above, a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.  

The Board expressly acknowledges its consideration of the lay evidence of record when adjudicating this claim, including the Veteran's reports of difficulty hearing, difficulty communication, and having to ask people to repeat themselves.  The Veteran is competent to report difficulty hearing; however, disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing.  See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

The rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing.  The functional impact that the Veteran describes, is contemplated by the rating criteria.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).  The Veteran's main complaint is reduced hearing acuity and clarity, which is what is contemplated in the rating assigned.  See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

5. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected left trunk scar.

A June 2018 legacy rating decision granted service connection for a heart disability, assigning a 100 percent evaluation, effective April 24, 2018.  See Rating Decision (June 2018).  The Veteran did not appeal and or submit new and material evidence within one year.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.  In July 2019, based on review of conflicting medical evidence regarding whether the Veteran had a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, the AOJ proposed to sever service connection based on a clear and unmistakable error.  See Rating Decision (July 2019).  In an April 2020 AMA rating decision, the AOJ severed service connection for the heart disability, effective July 1, 2020.  See Rating Decision (April 2020).  

On October 16, 2020, the AOJ received a supplemental claim to restore service connection for the heart disability.  See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (October 2020).  In an October 2020 rating decision, the AOJ confirmed and continued the severance.  See Rating Decision (October 2020).  In November 2020, the AOJ received a HLR request regarding the October 2020 rating decision.  See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (November 2020).  The AOJ identified a difference of opinion, but ultimately continued the denial of service connection for a heart disability in an April 16, 2021 rating decision.  See Rating Decision (March 2021); VA Form 20-0999 Higher-Level Review Return (March 2021); Rating Decision (April 2021).  

On April 11, 2022, the AOJ received the Veteran's HLR request regarding the denial of service connection in the April 2021 rating decision.  See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (April 2022).  In May 2022, the AOJ determined there was a duty to assist error.  See Rating Decision (May 2022).  The issue was transferred to the supplemental claim lane.  See Rating Decision (July 2022).  In a July 2022 rating decision, the AOJ restored service connection for the heart disability and assigned a 30 percent evaluation, effective July 1, 2020.  See Rating Decision (July 2022).  

On March 3, 2023, the AOJ received a supplemental claim for entitlement to an increased evaluation for the heart disability.  See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (March 2023).  In a June 21, 2023, rating decision, the AOJ granted a 100 percent evaluation for the heart disability, effective March 3, 2023, and granted a separate evaluation for a left trunk scar associated with the service-connected heart disability, and assigned a zero percent evaluation, effective March 3, 2023.  See Rating Decision (June 2023).  In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, and requested review of the June 2023 rating decision.  See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (July 2023).  In October 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal which granted an earlier effective date for the left trunk scar of July 1, 2020.  See Rating Decision (October 2023).  This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (October 2024).  

The Board finds that the relevant rating review period begins on October 16, 2020, the date of the Veteran's supplemental claim for restoration of service connection for the heart disability, as there was continuous prosecution since that time; and ends on June 21, 2023, the date of the rating decision that was later subject to Higher Level Review.  The Board notes that there is no separate claim of entitlement to service connection for a scar related to the service-connected heart disability; rather, service connection was granted as part of determining the severity of the heart disability.  Because that review was initiated by the October 16, 2020 claim of restoration of service connection for the heart disability, with continuous prosecution of the claim since that time, the Board finds that this is also, effectively, the date of claim for service connection for the left trunk scar as a complication of the heart disability.

The Board concludes that the criteria for a compensable disability rating for a left trunk scar have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

The Veteran's subclavian trunk scar is rated under Diagnostic Code 7802. Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  A maximum 10 percent evaluation is assigned for a scar that is 144 square inches or greater.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the Veteran's left trunk scar is not manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  Rather, the VA-obtained 2021 Heart Conditions and 2023 Scars examination reports show a scar that was either 5 or 5.5 centimeters by .2 centimeters.  See C&P Exam at 10 (March 2021); C&P Exam at 4 (March 2023).  The VA and private medical treatment records do not indicate any complaints or diagnoses of a left trunk scar.  See e.g., CAPRI (October 2020); CAPRI (March 2021); CAPRI (September 2021); CAPRI (December 2021); CAPRI (May 2022); VAMC Report of Hospitalization (March 2023); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (October 2021); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (August 2021); Disability Benefits Questionnaire - Veteran Provided (October 2020).  This does not meet the criteria for a 10 percent evaluation as the scar was less than 144 square inches.  

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 592-93 (1991) (holding that the Board must consider all potentially applicable regulatory provisions).  However, the Veteran's left trunk scar is not of the head, face, or neck, is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, is not unstable or painful, and does not have other disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7800-01, 7804; see also C&P Exam at 10 (March 2021); C&P Exam at 2, 5, 8 (April 2023).  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects.  Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, to include lay reports of record, and these reports are credible.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the Veteran does not assert that the left trunk scar is manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  Additionally, the Veteran has stated that the scar did not bother him and was not painful.  See C&P Exam at 2 (April 2023).  

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim was "a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit."  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  An informal claim is "[a]ny communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits."  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  VA must look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as applications or claims - formal and informal - for benefits and is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits.  Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992).  The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are: (1) an intent to apply for benefits; (2) an identification of the benefits sought; and (3) a communication in writing.  Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the plain language of the regulations requires a claimant to have intent to file a claim for VA benefits).

For claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form.  Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015).  Claims or appeals pending before VA on that date are to be decided based on the regulations as they existed prior to the amendment.  Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686.

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term date entitlement arose is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a facts found basis.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the RO receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers.  McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

Additionally, under the AMA, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in paragraph (c) of this section within one year of the issuance of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  Continuously pursuing a claim occurs where, after notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim, the Veteran files a supplemental claim, requests a higher-level review, or appeals to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, or after notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the Veteran files a supplemental claim or appeals to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

6. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 1, 2020 for the grant of service connection for the left trunk scar.

The Board concludes that the criteria are not met for an effective date prior to July 1, 2020, for the grant of service connection for a left trunk scar.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

VA is obligated to develop and adjudicate claims for secondary service connection that are reasonably raised during the processing of a properly initiated claim as to the primary service-connected disability's evaluation level.  Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 201 (2021).  VA is required to recognize, develop, and adjudicate a claim of secondary service connection due to treatment for the service-connected disability once those issues are raised as part of a formally initiated claim as to the proper evaluation level for service-connected disability.  Bailey, 33 Vet. App. at 203.  

A claim for secondary service connection is not treated as part of the primary claim for service connection (or a claim for increased rating for the primary condition).  Manzanares v. Shulkin, 863 F.3d 1374, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  Primary claims for service connection or subsequent claims for increased ratings for primary conditions do not necessarily encompass later claims for secondary service connection.  Manzanares, 863 F.3d at 1379.  A claim for secondary service connection is not an ancillary benefit.  Manzanares, 863 F.3d at 1378.  The definitions of "claim" and "benefit" do not suggest that a claim regarding a secondary condition should be treated as the same claim as a claim regarding a primary condition simply because they both seek additional compensation.  Gudinas v. McDonough, 54 F.4th 716, 720 (Fed. Cir. 2022).  

First, the Board finds that there is no actual claim that precipitated the grant of service connection because the claim was inferred by the AOJ based on the Veteran's supplemental claim for an increased evaluation for his service-connected heart disability, to which the scar is related.  See Rating Decision (December 2020); VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (March 2023).  As noted above, after severance of service connection in an April 2020 rating decision, that was effective July 1, 2020, the Veteran submitted an October 16, 2020 supplemental claim for restoration.  See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (October 2020).  Thereafter, the Veteran continuously prosecuted the claim for restoration of service connection for a heart disability.  See 38 C.F.R. §3.2500; see also Rating Decision (October 2020); VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (November 2020); VA Form 20-0999 Higher-Level Review Return (March 2021); Rating Decision (April 2021); VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (April 2022); Rating Decision (July 2022).  Service connection was eventually restored, effective the date of the severance, July 1, 2020.  See Rating Decision (July 2022).  From that time, the Veteran also continuously prosecuted a claim for an increased evaluation.  See 38 C.F.R. §3.2500; see also VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (March 2023); Rating Decision (June 2023); VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (July 2023); Rating Decision (October 2023); VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (October 2024).  The Board finds, that based on the Veteran's continuous prosecution of the October 16, 2020 claim for restoration for service connection for a heart disability and that a claim for service connection for a heart disability-related scar was inferred from that claim, the date of claim is October 16, 2020.  See Bailey, 33 Vet. App. at 203.  Thus, the date of claim is October 16, 2020.  

Second, the date entitlement arose is July 24, 2019.  A July 24, 2019 privately-filled out disability benefits questionnaire was submitted by the Veteran to substantiate the presence of heart disability.  See Disability Benefits Questionnaire - Veteran Provided at 4 (October 2020).  In that DBQ report, the clinician noted the presence of a scar due to treatment for the Veteran's heart disability.  See Disability Benefits Questionnaire - Veteran Provided at 4 (October 2020).  In March 22, 2021, the date of a VA examination that indicated that the Veteran's cardiac pacemaker placement had resulted in a scar of the left chest.  See C&P Exam at 5 (March 2021).  Although the Veteran had a cardiac pacemaker placed sometime in 2018, the VA and private medical records do not demonstrate any scar related to this surgery until the 2019 and 2021 examination reports.  See e.g., CAPRI (July 2019); CAPRI (October 2020); CAPRI (July 2021); CAPRI (December 2021); CAPRI (May 2022); CAPRI (March 2023); VAMC Report of Hospitalization (March 2023).  Notably, the May 2018 Heart Conditions VA-obtained report noted that there were no scars related to the claimed heart disability.  See C&P Exam at 8 (May 2018).  Even if present prior to July 24, 2019, this is the first time a record linked such a scar with the heart disability, and thus it was not until this date that service connection for a scar secondary to the service-connected heart disability was authorized by law and regulation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.  The later of the date of claim and date of entitlement is October 16, 2020; thus, no effective date prior to July 1, 2020 is warranted.

Accordingly, the claim is denied.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an effective date prior to July 1, 2020, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

7. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of basic eligibility for DEA.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of basic eligibility for DEA.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (October 2024).  

The Board concludes that the criteria are not met for an earlier effective date for the grant of basic eligibility for DEA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

DEA benefits are payable to the child, spouse, or surviving spouse of a Veteran if the following conditions are met:  (1) the Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501(a)(1), 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a).

The procedural history is relevant.  In a June 2018 rating decision, the AOJ granted basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance, based on the grant of service connection for a heart disability, with a 100 percent evaluation, effective from April 24, 2018.  See Rating Decision (June 2018).  The Veteran did not appeal or submit new and material evidence within one year of issuance of this rating decision.  The rating decision is thus final based on the evidence then of record.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

As part of the subsequent severance of service connection for a heart disability, basic eligibility to DEA was also severed, effective July 1, 2020.  See Rating Decision (April 2020).  Thereafter, basic eligibility was restored, effective July 1, 2020.  See Rating Decision (June 2023).  

First, basic eligibility to DEA has been in effect since April 2018 to the present time; this is the entire period on appeal.  There has been no lapse in benefits, so no earlier effective date is warranted.

Second, an effective date prior to April 24, 2018 is not warranted.  As noted above, the June 2018 rating decision is final.  If the Veteran believes he is entitled to an effective date prior to April 24, 2018, he must make a motion of clear and unmistakable error in that rating decision as the Board cannot recognize freestanding earlier effective date claims as a matter of law.  See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299 (2006).  

Accordingly, the claim denied.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an earlier effective date, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Special Monthly Compensation

8. Entitlement to SMC from July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023.  

The Veteran's attorney asserts that the Veteran is entitled to SMC from July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (October 2024).  Here, the Veteran is in receipt of SMC at the housebound rate from April 24, 2018 to July 1, 2020 and from March 3, 2023 to the present.  See Rating Decision - Codesheet (October 2023).  Thus, the period at issue is from July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023.  

The Board concludes that entitlement to SMC from July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023 is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

VA has a duty to maximize benefits and to consider entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) where applicable.  Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008); 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(a) (noting VA's obligation to "render a decision which grants every benefit that can be supported in law").  VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  

SMC at the housebound rate is payable where a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent, and, in addition has either: ( 1) a service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or, (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

As a result of the grant of a 100 percent evaluation for the service-connected heart disability from July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023, there is a single disability rated at 100 percent for this time period.  Furthermore, the Veteran has service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, that are separate and distinct from the heart disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  This is because, for this time period, the Veteran's PTSD is rated at 50 percent and the Veteran's tinnitus is rated at 10 percent.  See Rating Decision - Codesheet (October 2023).  These two evaluations involve different bodily systems from the heart disability (e.g., psychiatric and audiological) and combine to a 60 percent evaluation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.15.  Thus, the criteria for SMC at the housebound rate are met from July 1, 2020 to March 3, 2023.

Accordingly, the claim is granted.  

TDIU

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

9. Entitlement to TDIU based solely on service-connected heart disability.

The Veteran's attorney asserts that a TDIU is warranted for the relevant rating review period based solely on the Veteran's service-connected heart disability.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (October 2024).  

The Board concludes that the issue of whether TDIU is warranted based solely on the Veteran's service-connected heart disability is moot.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.16; Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  

For the entire rating review period, the Veteran's service-connected heart disability is rated as 100 percent disabling.  But a grant of a 100 percent disability rating does not always render the issue of TDIU moot because VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether the Veteran's disabilities establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  Specifically, SMC may be warranted if the Veteran is entitlement to TDIU based on a single disability with other disabilities rated at 60 percent.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).  TDIU may satisfy the "rated as total" element of section 1114(s), if the TDIU is awarded for a single disability.  Buie, 24 Vet. App. at 250 (2011).

But here, the Veteran is already in receipt of both a 100 percent evaluation for a single disability and SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) for the entire appeal period - since April 24, 2018.  Thus, a grant of TDIU based solely on the service-connected heart disability would not provide for any additional compensation.  Thus, the issue of entitlement to TDIU based solely on the service-connected heart disability, is moot and is dismissed as matter of law.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
