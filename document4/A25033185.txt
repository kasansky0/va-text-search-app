ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder condition is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, his right shoulder condition began during and has continued since his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right shoulder condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from November 1988 to November 1994 and in the Army National Guard of the United States from May 2003 to November 2003.  The Veteran also served in the Army National Guard with periods of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) and inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA).

This matter was initially denied in a July 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR).  In November 2023, the AOJ issued an HLR decision, which identified a duty to assist error and deferred adjudication for further development to obtain a medical opinion.

In August 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental review rating decision on appeal, which after considering a new examination and medical opinion, denied the claim.

The Veteran timely appealed that decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in September 2024 and requested the Direct Review option.  Therefore, any evidence submitted after the August 2024 rating decision cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In this case, a docket switch is still permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) as it is less than one year from the date that the AOJ mailed notice of the decision on appeal, but it is more than 60 days of the date that the Board received the September 2024 NOD.  However, as the instant decision represents a full grant of the benefits sought, there is no prejudice to the Veteran for proceeding before the end of one year from rating decision on appeal, and the Board shall proceed with adjudication.

Service Connection

To establish service connection for a claimed disorder, the following must be shown: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Evidence of continuity of symptomatology from the time of service until the present is required where the chronicity of a chronic condition manifested during service either has not been established or might reasonably be questioned.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see also, Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding only conditions listed as chronic diseases in § 3.309(a) may be considered for service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107.  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the Veteran.

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of symptoms.  See, Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board").

The Board has a duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence. Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).  Indeed, in Jefferson v. Principi, 271 F.3d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), citing its decision in Madden, recognized that the Board had inherent fact-finding ability.  Id. at 1076; see also, 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to weigh and assess the evidence.  Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992).

As a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is satisfactory, the Board may also properly consider internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the Veteran, and the Veteran's demeanor when testifying at a hearing.  See, Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

In determining the probative value to be assigned to a medical opinion, the Board must consider three factors.  See, Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  The initial inquiry in determining probative value is to assess whether a medical expert was fully informed of the pertinent factual premises (i.e., medical history) of the case.  A review of the claims file is not required since a medical professional can also become aware of the relevant medical history by having treated a Veteran for a long period of time or through a factually accurate medical history reported by a Veteran.  See, Id. at 303-04.

The second inquiry involves consideration of whether the medical expert provided a fully articulated opinion. See, Id. A medical opinion that is equivocal in nature or expressed in speculative language does not provide the degree of certainty required for medical nexus evidence.  See, McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

The third and final factor in determining the probative value of an opinion involves consideration of whether the opinion is supported by a reasoned analysis.  The most probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning.  Therefore, a medical opinion containing only data and conclusions is not entitled to any weight. In fact, a review of the claims file does not substitute for a lack of a reasoned analysis.  See, Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304; see also, Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions.").

To deny a claim on its merits, the weight of the evidence must persuasively stand against a finding that the evidence is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder condition is granted.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for a right shoulder condition because the condition onset during his active service.  For the following reasons, the Board agrees.

As an initial matter, the Board notes the AOJ conceded the Veteran's current disability, a right shoulder condition, and a qualifying event, injury, or disease that had its onset during service.  These are favorable findings which are binding on the Board.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Thus, the issue before the Board is the final element of service connection - whether there is a causal relationship between the Veteran's currently diagnosed disability and his active-duty service.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2023.  Upon the Veteran's HLR request, VA determined that the March 2023 examiner's medical opinion proffered was inadequate for adjudication as the in-service report of right shoulder trouble was not considered and the Veteran's post service treatment for his right shoulder was also not addressed.  The Board agrees that this medical opinion is inadequate for adjudication purposes.  

Following the duty to assist error found in the HLR process, the Veteran was afforded a second VA examination in December 2023 at which time the examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis.  The examiner noted the Veteran reported onset of his shoulder pain in 1988 and straining his right shoulder a few times in service.  The Veteran was further noted to report self-medicating with over-the-counter medicines for a "dull pain" in his right shoulder over the years.  The examiner noted the Veteran's STRs show an "ac joint separation" on the Veteran's exit exam in 1994.  The examiner further noted the Veteran reported suffering no other "major work related injuries" in 25 years of service as a cop post-military service.  Ultimately, the examiner opined that the Veteran's right shoulder strain was less likely than not related to service because 1) the majority of his current symptoms occurred around 2018, 2) a general medical exam in 2003 noted no major shoulder complaints, and 3) the 1994 incident resulted in no longterm complications contributing to his current complaints "decades" later.  

Because the medical evidence does not provide a nexus between the Veteran's in-service injury to his right shoulder, continuity of symptomatology must be considered.  See Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495 (1997).  In this regard, it is noted continuity of symptomatology, not continuity of treatment, is required to establish a nexus between a disorder noted in service and a chronic disorder found after service.  See Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991).  

Indeed, the VA examiner improperly added to the evidentiary standard for a service connection claim by implying a threshold of symptomatology.  No such standards are contemplated by VA regulations, and thus these statements constitute an improper basis to evaluate the Veteran's claim.  Instead, a Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in "approximate" balance.  See Lynch, 999 F.3d at 1394.  Here, a remand is unnecessary as the Board is able to resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran.

The Board notes the record does contain proof of complaint and treatment for a right shoulder condition in March 2023.  (emphasis added); See March 2023 Private Medical Records.  These records appear incomplete; however, the Board notes the Veteran has sought treatment from the same medical provider since at least 2017.

In sum, the objective medical evidence supports that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a right shoulder condition; a fact conceded by the AOJ.  The evidence also shows an in-service event or injury, also conceded by the AOJ.  Finally, the evidence shows that the Veteran has competently and credibly reported his symptoms and established continuity of symptomatology.

Accordingly, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder condition is warranted as the evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's current right shoulder condition had its onset during active service and has continued since.  The Veteran's claim is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
