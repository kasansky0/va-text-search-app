ORDER

For the entire period on appeal, entitlement to an initial 60 percent rating, but not higher, for the Veteran's service-connected chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, for the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's CFS was manifested by symptoms of debilitating fatigue, cognitive impairments (such as inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, or confusion), or a combination of other signs and symptoms which are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities to less than 50 percent of the pre-illness level.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

For the entire period on appeal, the criteria for an initial 60 percent disability rating, but not higher, for CFS are met.  38 U.S.C. §§?1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§?3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.14, 4.21, 4.27, 4.88b, Diagnostic Code 6354.??   

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this appeal, served on active duty from June 2002 to June 2006. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), that granted the Veteran service connection for his CFS disability with a 40 percent evaluation effective June 14, 2022. 

In July 2024, the Veteran initiated this appeal to the Board with the filing of a Decision Review Request (VA Form 10182), requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge on the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision.? In?an August 2024 correspondence, the Board acknowledged the appeal and informed the Veteran and his representative that the appeal had been placed on the Board's direct review docket.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's rating decision on appeal, here as of November 21, 2023.? 38?C.F.R. §?20.301.? If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the November 2023 decision, the Board did not consider it herein.? 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.? 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. §?3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Preliminary Matter

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.? See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21?Vet. App.?545, 552 (2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

Increased Ratings

Applicable Laws and Regulation

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity.? Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.? 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4.? Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.? The veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations.? See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589 (1991).?? 

When a Veteran seeks an increased evaluation, it will generally be presumed that the maximum benefit allowed by law and regulation is sought.? See AB v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?35, 38 (1993).? For initial increased rating claims, those stemming from the decision granting service connection, the most relevant evidence is "the evidence of record from the time of a veteran's application" for service connection.? See Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119, 127 (1999).? 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.? 

"Staged" ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999).? 

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.? The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability.? See Esteban v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?259, 261-62 (1994).? Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. 

Generally, the degree of probative value which may be attributed to a medical opinion issued by a VA or private treatment provider considers such factors as its thoroughness and degree of detail, and whether there was review of the claims file.? See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).? 

A layperson is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes through the senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 469 (1994).? Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation.? See Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303 (2007).? Lay evidence may establish a diagnosis of a simple medical condition, a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or symptoms that later support a diagnosis by a medical professional.? See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).? 

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance, with a claimant prevailing in either event.? 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.? The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.? See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).? 

The claimant bears the burden of presenting and supporting a claim for benefits.? 38?U.S.C. § 5107(a).? See Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

Rating Criteria

The Veteran is service connected for CFS at a 40 percent rating effective June 14, 2022.  See November 2023 Rating Decision.  The Veteran seeks a higher rating.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182.  

After a careful review of the evidence, lay and medical, the Board finds, for the reasons expressed below, that an initial rating higher than 40 percent for the Veteran's service-connected CFS is warranted.  

The Veteran's CFS is rated under Diagnostic Code 6354, which provides ratings for chronic fatigue syndrome.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.88b. Diagnostic Code 6354.  

Diagnostic Code 6354 evaluates the severity of the disability based on the presence of debilitating fatigue, cognitive impairments (such as inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, or confusion), or a combination of other signs and symptoms. 

A 40 percent evaluation is assigned where the signs and symptoms are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities from 50 to 75 percent of the pre-illness level; or where the signs and symptoms wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least four but less than six weeks total duration per year. 

An evaluation of 60 percent is assigned for signs and symptoms which are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities to less than 50 percent of the pre-illness level; or which wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least six weeks total duration per year. 

A total disability rating (100 percent) is assigned where the signs and symptoms are nearly constant and so severe as to restrict routine daily activities almost completely and which may occasionally preclude self-care.  38 C.F.R. § 4.88b, Diagnostic Code 6354.

A note to Diagnostic Code 6354 provides that, for the purpose of rating chronic fatigue syndrome, the condition will be considered incapacitating only while it requires bed rest and treatment by a physician.  38 C.F.R. § 4.88b.  

For the reasons expressed below, the Board finds that a rating of 60 percent, but not higher, for the Veteran's service connected CFS is warranted.

The Veteran was afforded three VA examinations for his service-connected CFS.  

In the March 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his CFS symptoms began in 2014, where he got fatigued shortly before he stopped working in 2015, that he could not fully recover every day in 2014 while he was in Los Angeles, that he feels he has had chronic fatigue for many years, and that he stopped working four years prior to the examination.  Because the VA examiner found that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of CFS and therefore did not conduct an analysis of the Veteran's symptoms, the Board will not discuss this examination any further.

In the August 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his CFS symptoms initially started in 2007, and that he was not sleeping well and has been chronically fatigued since getting out of service.  He also reported that he is unable to work normally and maintain focus due to being mentally and physically fatigued all the time and is too tired to recreate as he previously enjoyed, that he never feels rested and is frequently irritable, that he gets worn out so easily that he doesn't even try to do activities he previously enjoyed, and that if he does an activity such as mowing the lawn, he is unable to do other activities in the afternoon such as washing the dishes due to fatigue, and that he has difficulties focusing, concentrating and forgets things such as what he ate for meals the previous day.  Finally, the Veteran reported that he struggles with mental fatigue, finds active employment very difficult due to severe activity intolerance, loses focus easily due to the fatigue which makes work very difficult, struggles to remember tasks while at work such as measurements of windows and what he needs to work on next, and that he currently cleans vacation rentals for work, which takes about four hours between guests, and when he has to clean, he has to rest for several days due to his symptoms.  For these reasons, the examiner found that the Veteran's CFS impacts his ability to work.    

The examiner found that for six months or longer, the Veteran's debilitating fatigue reduced his daily activity to less than 50 percent of the pre-illness level, and that the Veteran experienced nearly constant symptoms of debilitating fatigue, generalized muscle aches or weakness, headaches, migratory joint pain, sleep disturbance, and fatigue lasting 24 hours or longer after exercise.  The examiner further found that the Veteran had cognitive impairment attributable to chronic fatigue syndrome in that he experienced forgetfulness and an inability to concentrate.  Although the examiner found that the Veteran's CFS reduced his daily activity to less than 50 percent of his pre-illness level, the examiner later noted that the Veteran's CFS symptoms restricted his daily activities from 50 to 75 percent of his pre-illness level, making the exam internally inconsistent.  The examiner also failed to discuss whether the Veteran's symptoms due to his CFS resulted in periods of incapacitation, defined as those requiring bed rest and treatment by a physician.  

In the November 2023 examination, the Veteran reported that in 2006, he started struggling with sleep and never feels rested, that he has had a sleep test and does not have sleep apnea, that he has to take a nap most days, is unable to get up some days, is fatigued so severely that he cannot make himself a meal, sometimes doesn't have the motivation to shower, is unable to work due to fatigue, is chronically in pain and exhausted, and has a hard time following directions and completing a task, as he forgets what he is doing.  

The examiner found that for six months or longer, the Veteran's debilitating fatigue reduced his daily activity to less than 50 percent of the pre-illness level, and that the Veteran experienced nearly constant symptoms of debilitating fatigue, nonexudative pharyngitis, palpable or tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, generalized muscle aches or weakness, headaches, migratory joint pain, neuropsychological symptoms, sleep disturbance, and fatigue lasting 24 hours or longer after exercise.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's fatigue is so severe, he can't get out of bed some days, that he has a sore throat most days, tender and palpable cervical and nodes around his face, weak muscles, headaches that feel like ice picks, joint pain which is worse in his wrists, that he is severely fatigued after any physical activity, and that his neuropsychological symptoms included mood swings, depression, inability to sleep and never getting into Rapid Eye Movement sleep.    

The examiner further found that the Veteran had cognitive impairment attributable to chronic fatigue syndrome in that he experienced forgetfulness and an inability to concentrate.  Although the examiner initially found that the Veteran's CFS reduced his daily activity to less than 50 percent of his pre-illness level and endorsed symptoms that were worse than in the August 2022 examination, the examiner later noted that the Veteran's CFS symptoms restricted his daily activities from 50 to 75 percent of his pre-illness level, making the exam internally inconsistent.  The examiner also failed to discuss whether the Veteran's symptoms due to his CFS resulted in periods of incapacitation, defined as those requiring bed rest and treatment by a physician.  

Although the August 2022 and November 2023 Chronic Fatigue DBQs contain conflicting evidence as to whether the Veteran's daily activities are restricted to less than 50 percent of his pre-illness level, both examiners agreed that the Veteran's CFS symptoms are nearly constant.  Further, there is competent and credible evidence showing that the Veteran's daily activities are in fact restricted to less than 50 percent of his pre-illness level.  First, the Veteran has continually stated that he is unable to work due to his CFS symptoms.  See April 2021 Chronic Fatigue Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ); August 2022 Chronic Fatigue DBQ; November 2023 Chronic Fatigue DBQ.  Additionally, he reported that he is too tired to recreate as he previously enjoyed, that he gets worn out so easily that he doesn't even try to do the activities he previously enjoyed, that if he does an activity such as mowing the lawn, he is unable to do other activities such as washing the dishes due to his fatigue, and he has difficulties focusing and concentrating.  See August 2022 Chronic Fatigue DBQ.  He also reported that when he cleans vacation rentals, which takes him about four hours, he has to rest for several days due to his CFS symptoms.  Id.  Finally, the Veteran reported he is fatigued so severely that he is not able to get up some days, cannot make himself a meal, has to nap all the time, that sometimes he does not even have the motivation to shower, and has a hard time following directions and completing a task because he forgets what he is doing.  See November 2023 Chronic Fatigue DBQ.   

The Board notes that the Veteran has not been shown to be competent to diagnose complex medical problems, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, or to opine as to the etiology of such disorders, which are medical questions.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?428 (2011).  Therefore, to the extent that his lay statements are offered as a medical opinion, the Board assigns them low probative weight.

Nevertheless, absent evidence to the contrary, the Veteran is competent to describe the nature and duration of his CFS symptoms, his daily level of fatigue and how his fatigue and other CFS symptoms effect his daily life.  See?Layno, supra.  Furthermore, the Board finds the Veteran's statements reflected in the March 2021, August 2022 and November 2023 VA Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DBQ's describing his daily fatigue, the nature and duration of his other CFS symptoms, and the restrictions his fatigue and other symptoms have on his daily activities both competent and credible.  In fact, there is nothing in the record that contradicts these lay assertions.

Accordingly, based on the competent and credible lay and medical evidence of record, and resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively in favor of the claim, and a rating of 60 percent, but not higher, is warranted from June 14, 2022, based on the Veteran's nearly constant CFS symptoms and his daily activities being restricted to less than 50 percent of his pre-illness level. 

A maximum rating of 100 percent for the Veteran's CFS is not warranted, as the Veteran's chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms are not nearly constant and so severe as to restrict routine daily activities almost completely and which may have occasionally precluded self-care.  Although there is evidence that the Veteran's CFS precludes him from making himself a meal and that sometimes he does not have the motivation to shower, there is no evidence that his daily activities are restricted almost completely.  See November 2023 Chronic Fatigue DBQ.      

 The Board has also considered whether entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is raised by the record.? See Rice?v. Shinseki,?22?Vet. App.?447?(2009).? Here, the August 2022 and November 2023 VA examiners indicated that the Veteran's CFS impacted his ability to work in that he is unable to work normally and maintain focus due to being mentally and physically fatigued all the time, and that some days he is not able to get up and has to nap all the time.  See August 2022 and November 2023 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DBQ's.  Additionally, the Veteran has contended that he is unable to work due to his CFS.  Id.; April 2021 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DBQ; 38 C.F.R. §?4.16?(a).  In this case, however, because the Board is awarding the Veteran an initial 60 percent disability rating effective June 14, 2022, the Veteran will have a 100 percent disability rating as of that day, rendering the issue of TDIU moot.   ? 

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled.  See Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994) (citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990)).  Thus, if VA has found a Veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate that Veteran totally disabled on any other basis.  See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

However, a grant of a 100 percent disability does not always render the issue of TDIU moot. VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities establish entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  

Specifically, SMC may be warranted if the Veteran has a 100 percent disability rating for a single disability, and VA finds that TDIU is warranted based solely on the disabilities other than the disability that is rated at 100 percent.  See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 280 (analyzing 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s)); see also 75 Fed. Reg. 11,229 -04 (March 10, 2010) (withdrawing VAOPGCPREC 6-1999).  In the instant matter, between June 14, 2022, and January 28, 2024, the Veteran did not have a 100 percent disability rating for a single disability.  Additionally, as the Veteran was granted a 100 percent disability rating for his service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder as of January 28, 2024, and his other service-connected disabilities were independently rated at 60 percent or more at that time, the Veteran was granted SMC based on housebound criteria being met.  See May 2024 Rating Decision.  Therefore, VA has complied with its duty to maximize the Veteran's benefits and the issue of TDIU is moot.  

Finally, neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 69-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).  

Accordingly, the appeal is granted.
