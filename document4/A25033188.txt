ORDER

Service connection for hypertension (claimed as high blood pressure) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The weight of the persuasive evidence is against finding that the Veteran's hypertension began during his active service, manifested to a compensable degree within a year of service separation, or is otherwise related to his active service, to include in-service elevated blood pressure readings.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107: 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from November 1978 to April 1987.  For his meritorious service, he received an Air Force Good Conduct Medal with 1 Oak Leaf Cluster and Air Force Overseas Ribbon, among other awards and decorations.  He had 3 years, 4 months, and 22 days of foreign service.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions of an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Service connection for hypertension is denied.

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, to prevail on the issue of direct service connection the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Hypertension is considered a chronic disease and will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if shown as chronic in service; or, if manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if it was noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

On August 10, 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was enacted.  Among other things, the PACT Act added hypertension to the list of disorders for presumption of service connection for Veterans who served during the Vietnam Era.  Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).  The Veteran did not serve in the Republic of Vietnam or any of the other recognized locations and, therefore, presumptive service connection is not warranted on the basis of exposure to herbicide agents.  Moreover, there is no indication that the Veteran served in the Persian Gulf or other locations added by the PACT Act during the requisite time periods.  He has not alleged nor has review of the record reflected any toxic exposure risk activity to warrant a medical opinion under 38 U.S.C. § 1168.  

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Daye v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 512, 526 (2006).

When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

The Veteran asserts that his hypertension is related to service.  Specifically, he contends that he was diagnosed with hypertension in 1980.  See January 2024 VA examination report for hypertension, pg. 2.   

VA regulations provide the term "hypertension" means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm. or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101, Note (1). 

Again, to prevail on the issue of direct service connection the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Evidence

Turning now to the evidence, the record reflects a current diagnosis of hypertension.  

As to an in-service injury, illness, or event, the Service Treatment Records (STRs) do not reflect any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for hypertension.  The Veteran also denied experiencing high blood pressure (BP).  STRs show BP readings of 120/80 in October 1986; 130/108 in November 1985; 130/80 in November 1985; 138/88 in July 1985; 130/94 in October 1985; 160/100 in February 1984; 130/90 in May 1984; 140/100 in May 1984; 132/84 in May 1984; 110/72 in June 1984; 150/100 in January 1983; 130/90 in an undated record; 130/80 in August 1983; 112/70 in an undated record; 115/80 in October 1981; 126/84 in October 1981; 112/80 in August 1981; 124/90 in August 1981; 112/80 in an undated record; 130/80 in August 1979; 126/96 in an undated record; and 130/84 in April 1979.  

Additionally, in the April 1987 report of medical history for enlistment into the United States Air Force Reserve, he denied experiencing high or low blood pressure.  The accompanying report of medical examination did not reflect any finding of hypertension or high blood pressure.  There is no objective clinical diagnosis of hypertension shown until years after the Veteran's separation from active service.  Private treatment records indicate that the Veteran's hypertension onset in 2018.

In January 2024, the Veteran was provided a VA medical examination for hypertension.  The examiner opined that it was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner reasoned that the Veteran had a history of morbid obesity which resulted in hypertension and chronic kidney disease stage 1.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's records indicated that his hypertension did not occur in the military and is directly related to modifiable risk factors and exposure.  The Veteran's enlistment exam dated April 1987 into the Reserve notes no high or low blood pressures issues.  Blood pressure on that examination was within normal limits.  On occasion, during service the Veteran had slightly higher blood pressure readings, but still within normal limits and not indicative of a hypertension condition.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's hypertension issues only appeared or started to appear as he gained weight.  Thus the Veteran's hypertension was more attributable to his obesity and not incurred or diagnosed during service.

The Board finds the January 2024 VA medical opinion is both well-reasoned and thorough, having considered the entire record, including STRs as well as the Veteran's medical history, and provides specific medical evidence for the opinion rendered.  As such, the medical opinion warrants probative weight.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  There are no contrary medical opinions of record.

First, the Board recognizes that hypertension is a chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  The Board has considered whether the Veteran is entitled to presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3).  However, the medical treatment records do not reflect a diagnosis of hypertension until years after separation from service.  

Next, regarding the claim for service connection for hypertension on a theory of continuity of symptomatology, the record indicates that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension years after separation from active duty.  Though the Veteran reported that he was diagnosed with hypertension in 1980, the accompanying STRs are absent for any diagnosis of hypertension and the Veteran himself denied experiencing high blood pressure during service and in 1987 when he was examined for entry into the United States Air Force Reserve.  Moreover, there is no objective clinical diagnosis of hypertension until years after separation from active service.  The Board thus finds that the weight of the evidence does not support a finding that the Veteran experienced symptoms of hypertension continuously since service and service connection based on continuity of symptomatology is not warranted.

However, the Board must still consider whether the Veteran's hypertension is directly related to his active service.  On that basis, the Board finds that the January 2024 VA examiner's opinion provides the most persuasive evidence regarding the etiology of the Veteran's hypertension.  The opinion was based on a review of the Veteran's relevant medical records, an objective evaluation, and consideration of his lay assertions.  Despite the Veteran's occasional in-service elevated blood pressure readings, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's hypertension did not develop until many years following service.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence demonstrates that service connection for hypertension on a direct basis is not warranted.

The Veteran has not presented any competent medical evidence that his hypertension was etiologically related to active service.  The only evidence in support of the Veteran's contentions is his own lay assertions.  Lay evidence may be competent to establish a medical etiology or nexus.  However, given that the Veteran has not demonstrated that he has the requisite specialized knowledge or training, and the etiology of hypertension is complex and requires medical testing, the Board finds that the Veteran is not competent to provide such a medically complex opinion as to the etiology of his hypertension.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Thus, the Veteran's lay assertions as to the etiology of his hypertension have little probative value.  The Board assigns greater probative value to the VA examiner's opinion because that clinician has the requisite medical expertise and knowledge to express an opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's hypertension.  

Finally, the Board recognizes the Veteran's statement that his hypertension onset in 1980.  However, the Board does not find the Veteran credible regarding his recollections as to when his hypertension onset.  Again, the STRs are absent for any diagnosis of hypertension and the Veteran himself denied high or low blood pressure, weighing against the Veteran's current recollections.  Further, there is no clinical evidence of hypertension until years after separation from active service.  See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (evidence of prolonged period without medical complaint can be considered, along with other factors concerning the veteran's health and medical treatment during and after military service, in assessing service-connection claim); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 239 (2012).  Accordingly, the Veteran's assertions are not entitled to probative value regarding his hypertension onset.  

In summary, the evidence persuasively weighs against service connection for hypertension.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Accordingly, the service connection claim for hypertension is denied.
