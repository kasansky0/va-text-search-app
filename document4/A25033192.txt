ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's currently diagnosed tinnitus was not present in service, was not manifested to a compensable disabling degree within the first year after discharge from service, was not continuous since service, and is not shown to be etiologically related to his active military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran was a member of the Army National Guard with active duty for training from June 1986 to August 1986; he served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1987 to March 1990; and had active duty in the United States Army Reserve from January 1991 to March 1991. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD). He selected the Direct docket. Therefore, the Board may only review evidence in the record at the time of the March 2024 decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Veteran contends that his tinnitus is related to his noise exposure in-service. The March 2024 rating decision provided favorable findings of a current diagnosis of tinnitus and exposure to hazardous noise in-service. The Board is bound by these findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Thus, the central question before the Board is whether the Veteran's tinnitus began in-service or is etiologically related to his in-service noise exposure.

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), 78 F.3d 604 (Fed.Cir.1996) (table).

Where a veteran served continuously for ninety days or more during a period of war or during peacetime service after December 31, 1946, and a chronic disease, such as an organic disease of the nervous system (which includes tinnitus), becomes manifest to a degree of ten percent within one year of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in or aggravated by service even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. The disease need not be diagnosed within a presumptive period, it must be shown by acceptable medical or lay evidence, that there were characteristics manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. Id. 

Where the evidence shows a "chronic disease" in service or "continuity of symptoms" after service, the disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service. For the showing of "chronic" disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. With chronic disease as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service-connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally, a showing of "continuity of symptoms" after service is required for service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). The second and third elements outlined above may be established by showing continuity of symptomatology for certain specified diseases. Continuity of symptomatology may be shown by demonstrating "(1) that a chronic disease was 'noted' during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology." Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307 (2007); see also Davidson, 581 F.3d at 1316; Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Veteran's service treatment records do not indicate any evidence of a diagnosis, symptom, or complaint of tinnitus, to include ringing in the ears.

The Veteran underwent an audio examination in March 2024. The Veteran reported recurrent tinnitus. He stated the onset of his tinnitus was years ago. He stated the circumstances of the onset of tinnitus was unknown. He explained he noticed when the tinnitus when he laid on his left ear, and it muffled the tinnitus. The Veteran reported the tinnitus affected the left side only. He noted his tinnitus had become constant in the past 4 years. The examiner opined the tinnitus is less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The examiner reasoned that Veteran's military occupational specialty (petroleum specialist) had a low probability for hazardous noise. The Veteran did not have a length of service to expose him to continuous hazardous noise over an extended period of time. The examiner noted the Veteran's service treatment records confirm no auditory damage from enlistment to separation. Further, the treatment records were silent for any hearing loss or tinnitus. The post separation records are silent for tinnitus from separation to the present. The Veteran's report that his asymmetric tinnitus improved when sound is removed from the affected ear, confirms that the tinnitus is not noise induced tinnitus, as asymmetric tinnitus has an organic origin. The examiner concluded that with no evidence of auditory damage and no evidence of post-service tinnitus, it is less likely than not caused or a result of military noise exposure. 

The Veteran is competent to state that his tinnitus began after a certain event; however here he generally stated his noise exposure caused his tinnitus. He is not competent to provide a nexus between his current tinnitus and his exposure to noise in-service generally. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The Veteran has not shown he has the knowledge required to determine the etiology of his tinnitus or the impact of noise on any organic disease of the nervous system. 

The Board finds that the March 2024 VA examiner's opinion is adequate because the examiner relied on sufficient facts and data, acknowledged the Veteran's in-service noise exposure, considered the Veteran's reported history, and provided a rationale for the opinions rendered. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). The rationale explained that the Veteran had some level of noise exposure in-service, but it did not cause auditory damage that would likely cause tinnitus. Further, the examiner explained why the tinnitus was likely not noise induced based on the Veteran's statement regarding relief from tinnitus when his left ear was muffled. The Board finds this rationale persuasive, because it explains why the Veteran's tinnitus was not caused by his in-service noise exposure. Such evidence is highly probative.

Based on a review of the evidence, the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus is not warranted. The Board finds the only probative evidence in the record demonstrates that the Veteran's tinnitus is not caused or aggravated by his service, to include his noise exposure. 

Further, the evidence does not demonstrate that tinnitus had its onset in service or has been continuous since service, nor has the Veteran stated his tinnitus began in-service. The evidence also does not indicate the Veteran's tinnitus manifested itself within one year of separating from service. During the March 2024 VA examination, the Veteran stated his tinnitus had its onset for years, but it was not consistent until four years prior. The Board finds such evidence does not demonstrate his tinnitus began within one year of service. 

As the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107.
