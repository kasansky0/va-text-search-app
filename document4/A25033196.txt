REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected allergic rhinitis is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1986 to June 1998 and from January 2001 to September 2012.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) with the October 2023 rating decision. The Veteran selected the direct review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R.        §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

Since the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from an injury or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation of a pre-existing injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty, in the active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. In order to prevail on the issue of entitlement to secondary service connection, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected allergic rhinitis.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea due to his service-connected rhinitis disability.  In June 2023, the Veteran submitted with his supplemental claim a lay statement that there is correlation between sleep apnea and his rhinitis condition. See June 2023 Lay Statement. 

The AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. See October 2023 Rating Decision. The Veteran is service connected for allergic rhinitis. See January 2025 Rating Decision-Codesheet. 

In July 2023 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for obstructive sleep apnea. In August 2023, an examiner provided a medical opinion concerning secondary service connection. The examiner explained that the Veteran's October 2019 polysomnogram did not report hypopnea, snoring, or marked desaturation to support nasal attribution of his obstructive sleep apnea. The examiner further explained that there is no direct cause-effect relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and rhinitis and rhinitis does not have significant influence of [sic.] sleep parameters. The examiner concluded that there was no specific documentation or objective evidence in the Veteran's file that would support any causal relationship between sleep apnea and rhinitis. As such, the examiner opined that obstructive sleep apnea was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected rhinitis condition. 

The Board finds the August 2023 VA medical opinion is inadequate for the following reasons. First, the examiner failed to consider the Veteran's June 2023 lay statement in which he states that his sleep is impacted by his snoring, the Veteran's report at the July 2023 VA examination that he started snoring in 2006 and that his snoring woke him, and the October 2019 treatment record from The Arlington Sleep Disorder Center which documents the Veteran's chief complaint of snoring and relates a history of snoring for 13 years to include being awakened by snoring. Second, the examiner failed to provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was aggravated by his service-connected rhinitis. Relying on an inadequate opinion is a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error.  Accordingly, a remand is necessary to obtain an addendum opinion. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from a VA examiner for the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea. Prior to obtaining an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician, the claims folder and a copy of this remand must be made available to the examiner for review of the case.

Based on the review of the claims folder, the examiner is asked to provide an opinion on the following:

Whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is at least as likely as not caused by or aggravated by his service-connected allergic rhinitis. 

The examiner should consider and address the Veteran's June 2023 lay statement in which he states that his sleep is impacted by his snoring, the Veteran's report at the July 2023 VA examination that he started snoring in 2006 and that his snoring woke him, and the October 2019 treatment record from The Arlington Sleep Disorder Center which documents the Veteran's chief complaint of snoring and relates a history of snoring for 13 years to include being awakened by snoring.

A detailed rationale for the medical opinion must be provided. If the requested opinion cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why.
