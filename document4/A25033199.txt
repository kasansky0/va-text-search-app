DOCKET NO. 240816-465804
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to an effective date prior to January 22, 2024, for the grant of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The appeal for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD in the February 2024 rating decision was pending a Higher-Level Review (HLR) decision before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) when the Veteran filed his August 2024 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) initiating this appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Review of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD violates the prohibition of concurrent elections, and it is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500(b), 19.2, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from May 2001 to February 2022. 

This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which granted service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and assigned a 30 percent rating effective January 22, 2024. The Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) was received in August 2024. The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The appeal for entitlement to an effective date prior to January 22, 2024, for the grant of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

Under the AMA, a claimant may take any of the following actions within one year from the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision on a claim: file a request for Higher-Level Review, file a Supplemental Claim, or file a Notice of Disagreement (Board appeal), provided that a claimant is not pursuing these requests concurrently. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a). Once a claimant takes any of the above actions, the claimant may not take another action with respect to the same claim or same issue contained within the claim until the Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement is adjudicated or withdrawn. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

In December 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for service connection for PTSD. In a February 2024 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for PTSD and assigned a 30 percent rating effective January 22, 2024.

In July 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 and sought higher level review due to "[d]isagreement with the assigned effective date for the granted claim of PTSD."

In August 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 NOD initiating a direct review Board appeal on the issue of "[d]isagreement with the assigned effective date for the granted claim of PTSD."

Based on the above, the Board finds that the July 2024 request for HLR was still pending when the Veteran filed his August 2024 NOD on the same issue. Therefore, the August 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD constitutes an impermissible concurrent election and must be dismissed as a matter of law. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).
