REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 9, 2022, for the grant of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1984 to March 1988, with additional periods of service in the National Guard.

In a November 2022 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction granted TDIU effective August 9, 2022.  In the December 2023 supplemental rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU.  The modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies to this claim.  

In his March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after that date, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding this matter, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 9, 2022, for the grant of TDIU

At issue is the extent of the Veteran's employment and whether he was rendered unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment during the relevant period due to his service-connected bilateral knee disabilities.  The record is unfortunately unclear as to the complete picture of his employment status for certain periods despite his submission of several VA Forms 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, that appear inconsistent.  A remand is therefore required to obtain his Federal or state tax returns, W-2 forms, and earnings statements from the Social Security Administration (SSA).

Additionally, the Veteran's claim file includes records from SSA regarding his initial application for SSA disability benefits.  However, prior to the rating decision on appeal, there are references in the Veteran's claim file that he reapplied and was granted SSA disability benefits, based in part on his service-connected bilateral knee disabilities.  The Board thus concludes that there are outstanding records to obtain and associate with the claim file.  See Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request that the Veteran verify his personal income, to include the submission of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) W-2 Forms, tax returns, and pay stubs attributable to his annual income prior to August 9, 2022.  The Veteran is encouraged to cooperate with the AOJ's efforts to obtain this information in a reasonable time and is on notice that failure to provide such may negatively impact the outcome of this appealed issue seeking TDIU.

2. Obtain for the record from SSA copies of its determination on the Veteran's claim for SSA disability benefits (and all medical records considered in connection with such claim).
