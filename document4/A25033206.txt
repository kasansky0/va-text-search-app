ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

There is at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus disability is related to his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for a tinnitus disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1116, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 2017 to June 2018.   

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an February 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision that considered the evidence of record on that date. 

In May 2024 the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request to the Board and selected the Direct Review option by a Veterans Law Judge. Under the Direct Review Docket, the Board is prohibited from considering evidence submitted after the rating decisions on appeal.

Legal Criteria for Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish entitlement to service-connected compensation benefits, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement." Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

Service connection may also be granted for disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Depending on the evidence and the contentions of record in a particular case, lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis and medical etiology of a condition. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009; Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Service connection may also be established for a current disability on the basis of a presumption that certain chronic diseases, to include organic diseases of the nervous system such as sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after service must have had their onset in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a). For organic diseases of the nervous system, the disease must have manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3).

Service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus can also be established through continuity of symptomatology. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309. For chronic diseases shown as such in service or within the applicable presumptive period, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date are service-connected unless attributable to an intercurrent cause. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). For a chronic disease to be considered to have been "shown in service," there must be a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings. Id. When the condition noted in service or within the presumptive period is not a chronic disease, a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required. Id.

1. Service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

The Veteran is claiming service connection for tinnitus, claiming that this condition had its onset during his active-duty service. Specifically, in his August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran wrote that while working as a Line medic while on active duty, he was constantly exposed to Mortar fire, causing him to develop hearing loss and intermittent ringing. 

Initially, the Board notes that in the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the RO found that the evidence showed that a qualifying event, injury or disease had its onset in service and noted that the Veteran's MOS had a low probability of noise exposure. The Board is bound by this favorable finding and thus, the Board finds that noise exposure in service has been shown. See 38 C.F.R. § 1154(a).

During a December 2023 VA audiological examination, the Veteran reported that he began to experience the gradual onset of both hearing loss and tinnitus in 2018. The Veteran reported bilateral high pitched ringing sounds, occurring three to four times per month, and lasting for five to ten seconds. He reported that the ringing had become louder and more frequent since onset. The Veteran is competent to report symptoms observable to a layperson, including the onset of ringing in ears. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (2009). The Board finds the Veteran's report of ringing in his ears to be competent and credible.

Conversely, following the December 2023 examination, the audiologist responded "no" under the question, does the Veteran report recurrent tinnitus. The examiner explained that the Veteran's description of symptoms did not meet the Dauman and Tyler (1992) definition of tinnitus cited in the Tinnitus Handbook (Tyler) Veteran reports transient ear noise that occurs in the general population without auditory damage or pathology. This VA examiner opined that transient ear noise is not consistent with noise-induced tinnitus and is less likely than not related to military noise exposure.

To this, the Board notes that tinnitus is, by definition "a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking. It is usually subjective in type." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 1914 (30th ed. 2003). As such, tinnitus is "subjective," as its existence is generally determined by whether or not the Veteran claims to experience it. For VA purposes, tinnitus has been specifically found to be a disorder with symptoms that can be identified through lay observation alone. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). If a veteran reports ringing in his or her ears, then a diagnosis of tinnitus is generally applied without further examination. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran does have a current diagnosis of tinnitus.

As noted above, the Veteran's in-service exposure to military noise has previously been conceded. The Board notes that the Veteran himself is of the opinion that a link exists between his current tinnitus and active service. Specifically, the Veteran has reported the onset of his tinnitus as occurring while on active duty in 2018 and has continued since. These lay statements are sufficient to establish a nexus between the Veteran's current tinnitus and the in-service incurrence. To the extent that the grant of service connection for tinnitus is based upon the plausible, consistent, and credible lay evidence, "[n]othing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] requires both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself". Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1335.

While the Board acknowledges the negative opinion offered by the December 2023 examiner, the Board finds that this opinion lacks probative value as it appears to be internally inconsistent. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not report recurrent tinnitus but failed to account for the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements as made during the examination indicating tinnitus that began shortly after his active-duty service in 2018 and has continued since. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1337 (a VA examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the Veteran's] disability so that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence).

For the reasons above, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset in service. As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
