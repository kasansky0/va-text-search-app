ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his bilateral hearing loss is at least as likely as not related to his service. 

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his tinnitus is at least as likely as not related to his service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.   

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.   

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to June 1971.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The Veteran selected the hearing docket in his January 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD) to the Board; as such, evidence up until the date of the rating decision on appeal and submitted within 90 days of the January 2025 hearing will be considered.  

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The evidence must show (1) the existence of a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, to include hearing loss and tinnitus, will be presumed related to service if they were noted as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if continuity of the same symptomatology has existed since service, with no intervening cause.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1991).

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.   

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  

The Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss considered to be disabling for VA purposes during his December 2023 VA hearing loss examination.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  In addition, the December 2023 examination shows a diagnosis of recurrent tinnitus, which the Veteran is also competent to diagnose.  Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).  As such, a current disability has been shown for both hearing loss and tinnitus.  

As noted above, both sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus are considered to be "organic diseases of the nervous system," and are therefore chronic diseases for VA purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); see also Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271-72 (2015).  As such, service connection for both disabilities may be awarded based on continuity of symptomatology.

Although service treatment records (STRs) do not show hearing loss in service, the Veteran competently and credibly reported during his December 2023 examination and January 2025 hearing before the Board that he experienced acoustic trauma in service, without hearing protection, while serving in the Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) when he was exposed to hazardous noise on a daily basis while serving in combat, especially noise from firearms and explosives.  In addition, VA has conceded the Vietnam's service had a high probability of hazardous noise exposure as he served in the infantry combat zone while in Vietnam.  The Veteran further stated that he noticed constant ringing in his ears and hearing loss since his exposure to acoustic trauma in service.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Therefore, based on the foregoing, in-service acoustic trauma has been shown.  

During the course of the appeal, Veteran has generally asserted that his bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus have been persistent since service.  These statements are competent and there is no evidence that they are not credible.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372.  As such, they are entitled to significant probative weight as to the continuity of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus symptoms since service.  In addition, the Veteran's wife submitted a supporting statement in January 2025 regarding witnessing the Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus symptoms for decades.  The Board acknowledges the VA medical opinion of record that provides a negative nexus opinion; however, this opinion did not adequately take into account the Veteran's lay statements regarding exposure to in-service noise trauma and continuity of symptoms since leaving service.  As such, it is assigned little probative weight.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran continuously experienced symptoms of hearing loss and tinnitus since service.  Thus, the Board finds that after resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the evidence establishes that the current bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus are related to active military service and service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability and tinnitus is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).
