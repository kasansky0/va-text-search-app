ORDER

The Veteran's in-service accident occurred in the line of duty and is not the result of willful misconduct. 

Service connection for ASIA tetraplegia is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's actions were not willful misconduct; the accident was in the line of duty. 

2. The Veteran's ASIA tetraplegia was incurred while on active duty. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the award of service connection for ASIA tetraplegia are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1996 to March 1997 and from March 2001 to July 2001. He had additional periods of reserve component service. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the direct review docket. As such, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the decision on appeal (October 6, 2023). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

The Veteran contends that service connection for ASIA tetraplegia is warranted. 

As an initial matter, the October 2023 rating decision made the favorable findings that new and relevant evidence had been received to reconsider the Veteran's claim for service connection for ASIA tetraplegia, that the Veteran had a diagnosis of unspecified quadriplegia, and that the Veteran sustained a neck injury resulting in paralysis on July 1, 2002. The Board is bound by these findings absent clear and unmistakable error, which is not present. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty from active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that which is pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

However, in order for a veteran to be entitled to disability compensation, such as service connection, the injury or disease from which the veteran's disability results must have been incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service "in line of duty." 38 U.S.C. §§ 105(a), 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(k), 3.1(m), 3.301(a). "In line of duty" means an injury or disease incurred or aggravated during a period of active military, naval, or air service unless such injury or disease was the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct or, for claims filed after October 31, 1990, was a result of his or her abuse of alcohol or drugs. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(m). 

When a claim is based on a period of Reserve or National Guard service, it must be shown that the individual concerned became disabled (or died) as a result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty (on Reserve active duty for training (ACDUTRA)/inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA) or during federalized National Guard service). Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40 (2010). Otherwise, the period would not qualify as "active military, naval, or air service" and the claimant would not achieve "veteran status" for purposes of that claim. 38 U.S.C. § 101(2) (24). 

Time spent proceeding directly to and from ACDUTRA and INACDUTRA must be considered as part of the active or inactive duty for training as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(e).? VA will determine whether an individual was authorized or required to perform such duty, and whether the individual was disabled or died from an injury or covered disease after taking into consideration: "the hour on which the individual began to proceed or return; the hour on which the individual was scheduled to arrive for, or on which the individual ceased to perform, such duty; the method of travel performed; the itinerary; the manner in which the travel was performed; and the immediate cause of disability or death." 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(e). In any claim for benefits alleging the claimant is entitled to benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(e), the burden of proof shall be on the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(e). However, the VA may not craft an appropriate itinerary when the service department did not do so in the first instance. See Watkins v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 253, 265 (2022). 

VA has defined willful misconduct as an act involving conscious wrongdoing or known prohibited action. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n). It involves deliberate or intentional wrongdoing with the knowledge of or wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n)(1). Mere technical violation of police regulations or ordinances will not per se constitute willful misconduct. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n)(2). Willful misconduct will not be determinative unless it is the proximate cause of injury, disease, or death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (n)(3).

VA must presume an injury was not caused by willful misconduct, and a preponderance of the evidence is required to rebut this presumption. ?38 U.S.C. §? 105(a);?Thomas v. Nicholson, 423 F.3d 1279, 1283-85 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The phrase "willful misconduct," in its ordinary meaning, entails three requirements for the Board to find the phrase applicable. The Board must (1) identify conduct; (2) the identified conduct must be misconduct; and (3) the identified misconduct must be willful. Martin v. McDonald, 761 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2014). 

The simple drinking of alcoholic beverages is not of itself "willful misconduct." However, if, in drinking of a beverage to enjoy its intoxicating effects, intoxication results proximately and immediately in disability or death, the disability or death will be considered the result of the person's willful misconduct. 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(c)(2). The abuse of alcohol is defined as the use of alcoholic beverages over time, sufficient to cause disability to, or death of, the user. 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(d).  

The proximate cause analysis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n) requires a determination of whether the causal link between the willful misconduct and the claimed injury is so attenuated that the consequence is more aptly described as mere chance.? See Carter v. McDonough, 46 F.4th 1356 (quoting Paroline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 445 (2014)). "Proximate cause" is defined as "[a] cause that directly produces an event and without which the event would not have occurred." Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 173 (2010) (citing Black's Law Dictionary 213 (7th ed. 1999)). In other words, "the proximate cause of an event is that act or omission which, in natural and continuing sequence, unbroken by an efficient intervening cause, produces the event, and without which that event would not have occurred."? MicroStrategy Inc. v. Bus. Objects, S.A., 429 F.3d 1344, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2005).?

A service department finding that the injury, disease, or death occurred in the line of duty will be binding on VA unless it is patently inconsistent with the requirements of laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(m); see Kinnaman v. Principi, 4 Vet. App. 20, 28 (1993). Likewise, a service department finding that injury, disease, or death was not due to misconduct will be binding on VA unless it is patently inconsistent with the facts and the requirements of laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n). When the evidence of record includes service department findings, it is error for the Board to make its own findings of facts of line of duty and willful misconduct without addressing the service department findings before it. Crediford v. Shulkin, 877 F.3d 1040, 104647 (Fed. Cir. 2017). "The regulations recognize that the Service Department is in the best position to assess willful misconduct and line of duty actions of its Service." Id. (citing United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 338 U.S. 338, 341 (1949)).

A Veteran need only demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence to prevail. If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, which includes but is not limited to equipoise, reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the claimant. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

The issue before the Board is whether the Veteran's injuries occurred in the line of duty. Thus, the Board must determine whether the Veteran engaged in willful misconduct, and so whether such misconduct was the proximate cause of his injuries. 

On July 1, 2002, the Veteran was at the home of a fellow Servicemember in Springfield, Missouri. While intoxicated, the Veteran fell from a tree. This fall caused the Veteran's ASIA tetraplegia. See July 2022 VA medical opinion.

The Veteran reports that he was ordered to turn in his assigned individual equipment to his unit on July 1, 2002. The night prior, he traveled from his home in Sedalia, Missouri to Springfield, Missouri, the location of his assigned unit. The Veteran travelled the day prior due to an early report time and the distance between Sedalia and Springfield, which is approximately two hours. 

While in Springfield, the Veteran stayed at the home of a friend and fellow servicemember, S.M. While at the home of S.M., the two friends "had a few beers." The Veteran reported that this was 2-4 beers over the period of several hours. The Veteran brought a deer stand to S.M.'s home to inspect and adjust the stand prior to the upcoming hunting season. After adjusting the deer stand, the Veteran and S.M. attached it to a tree in S.M.'s front yard. While in the tree, a branch broke and the Veteran fell approximately 15 feet. He was immediately paralyzed. 

S.M. submitted a statement attesting that the Veteran was adjusting the deer stand when a tree branch fell. S.M. also stated that he did not notice any signs that the Veteran was intoxicated at the time of the fall. 

The Veteran was transported to a local hospital and was admitted at 3:30 a.m. on July 1, 2002. There is no evidence regarding what time the Veteran arrived at the emergency room. Records from the hospital where the Veteran was initially seen are not in the claims file. On July 16, 2002, the Veteran was transferred to a hospital in Englewood, Colorado for rehabilitation. These records state that the Veteran "was playing around with a friend, climbing trees when a branch gave way, causing him to fall 15 ft onto his back." These records note his blood alcohol content as 0.146, although the blood alcohol test results are not in the claims file. 

A July 12, 2002 Statement of Medical Examination and Duty Status contains two sections. Section I is to be completed by the attending physician or hospital patient administrator. Section I, block 11 asks for a medical opinion. This section states that the Veteran was under the influence of alcohol, that he was mentally sound, and that his injuries were incurred in the line of duty. The detailed facts state that "SM was injured when he fell from a tree, OA 01 July 2002. Springfield, Missouri. All other details are unknown at this time. Active Duty National Guard." Block 13 states that a blood alcohol test was conducted and block 13 states that the results of the blood alcohol test was unknown. Section II, which is to be completed by the unit commander or unit advisor, is blank.

A November 2006 administrative decision acknowledged the medical opinion that the Veteran's injuries were incurred in the line of duty, but found that the Veteran's injuries were not in the line of duty due to willful misconduct. This decision states, in part: 

The veterans BAC at the time of the accident was 0.146; the National Safety Council (NSC) has established that a BAC of .08 or more establishes a presumption that the person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

Although the Statement of Medical Examination and Duty Status states that the injury was incurred in the line of duty, the available evidence reveals that the injuries sustained on July 01, 2002 were not incurred in the line of duty. The veteran by his own admission was playing around with a friend when he fell while under the influence of alcohol with a BAC over .08. During this state he chose to undertake tasks that rendered him unqualified, physically and mentally because of alcohol.

The Board has carefully considered the evidence of record. To the extent the July 12, 2002 Statement of Medical Examination and Duty Status is a service department finding, the Board is bound by this finding because it is not patently inconsistent with the laws administered by the VA. To the extent this statement is not a service department finding, the Board accords probative weight to the statement because it is a near-contemporaneous record regarding the Veteran's injuries. 

Ultimately, the Board finds that the Veteran's actions were not misconduct and thus his injuries were incurred in the line of duty. The Board notes that at the time of his injuries, the Veteran was at a location where he was staying the night, he was of legal age to consume alcoholic beverages, and he was not engaged in any illegal conduct.  There is no evidence of abuse of alcohol in this case, as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(d). As such, the Board finds that the presumption that conduct was in the line of duty is not overcome.  

?

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's injury on July 1, 2002, is in the line of duty and is not due to his willful misconduct.  As such, service connection for the ensuing injuries is warranted, and therefore service connection for ASIA tetraplegia is also granted at this time.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. In so reaching that conclusion, the Board has appropriately applied the benefit of the doubt doctrine in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
