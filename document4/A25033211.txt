ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 100 percent for schizophrenia is denied.

REFERRED ISSUE

The record raises whether the Veteran is competent to manage her benefits, as she has recently been returning her VA compensation checks and requesting VA discontinue her benefits. See November 2024 reports of contact. The AOJ should take appropriate action.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's schizophrenia is assigned a 100 percent rating, which is the maximum schedular rating authorized for mental disorders.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 100 percent for schizophrenia have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9201.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2010 to May 2014.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran contends that a rating in excess of 100 percent for her service-connected schizophrenia is warranted. See May 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).

For increased rating appeals within the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system, the appeal period is limited up to the date of the AOJ decision. Initially, the Veteran was granted service connection for an adjustment disorder with anxiety and psychotic disorder effective May 30, 2014, with a 50 percent rating in an August 2014 rating decision following her separation from service. VA reduced the Veteran's rating to 0 percent in a June 2015 rating decision after the Veteran failed to report for examination. The Veteran did not appeal this decision. VA received an Intent to File from the Veteran on January 5, 2023, followed by a VA Form 21-526EZ Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits in May 2023. The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2023, which clarified her diagnosis as schizophrenia. In the June 2023 rating decision on appeal, the RO recharacterized her claim as an increased rating for schizophrenia and granted an increase of the Veteran's rating to 100 percent effective January 5, 2023. Therefore, the applicable rating period here is January 5, 2023, the date of the Veteran's Intent to File, to June 21, 2023, the date of the rating decision on appeal. 

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran's current 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

The June 2023 rating decision on appeal granted the 100 percent rating for the Veteran's schizophrenia for the entire period on appeal. The Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular evaluation available under Diagnostic Code 9201, which is the part of the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, for the entire period on appeal. Accordingly, because the Veteran may not obtain a rating in excess of 100 percent, the matter must be denied as a matter of law. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

The Board notes that the Veteran has made statements, to include argument in support of her Notice of Disagreement in May 2024, regarding her disagreement with her diagnosis of schizophrenia and its etiology. However, mental health conditions are medically complex, and therefore, outside the competence of the Veteran because the record does not show that she has the training or credentials in mental health to render an opinion as to her diagnosis or the etiology of her mental health condition. Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the objective evidence of record. 

Finally, the Board has considered VA's duty to maximize a veteran's benefits, including possible entitlement to SMC in addition to a total disability rating. SMC at the housebound rate is payable where a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent, and has an additional, service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, that are separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involve different anatomical segments or bodily systems. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i). However, the Veteran does not have other disabilities that combined to 60 percent at any time during the appeal period.
