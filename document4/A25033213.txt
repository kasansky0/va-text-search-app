ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of July 17, 2021, for the grant of a 100 percent rating for anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of July 17, 2021, for the grant of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35 (DEA), is granted.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound status is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran submitted the initial claim for entitlement to service connection for anxiety, depression, and alcohol abuse disorder in December 2021, within one year of his separation from military service on July 16, 2021, and he continually pursued the claim.

2. Affording the Veteran all benefit of the doubt, the most probative evidence of record establishes that the Veteran's anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder have been productive of total occupational and social impairment since July 17, 2021.

3. Basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status is established from July 17, 2021.

4. The Veteran does not have a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more. Nor is the Veteran permanently housebound due to a service-connected disability or disabilities.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2017 to July 16, 2021. 

This appeal comes before the Board on appeal of a January 2024 supplemental claim rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In May 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request, Board Appeal, Notice of Disagreement, under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), and selected direct review.

The Veteran is advised that under direct review the Board is only able to consider evidence received as of, and prior to, the January 2024 rating decision. Any evidence received after the January 2024 rating decision cannot be considered. If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that any favorable findings made by an AOJ or any other prior VA adjudicator, is binding on the Board. The January 2024 supplemental claim rating decision did not specifically address whether new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claim. However, as the AOJ took up the merits of the Veteran's claim, the Board infers that the AOJ made a favorable finding that new and relevant evidence was indeed submitted. Therefore, the Board will not address the issue of new and relevant evidence to readjudicate the claim, as it is acknowledged that a favorable finding of sufficient new and relevant evidence is of record to proceed to the merits of the issue.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran indicated on his VA Form 10182 that there was clear and unmistakable evidence (CUE). However, CUE must be addressed by the AOJ in the first instance. The AOJ has not addressed the issue of CUE as that issue was not raised for AOJ consideration. Therefore, the issue of CUE is not presently before the Board, and the Board cannot adjudicate that issue. The Veteran may submit a claim of CUE to the AOJ if he so desires.      

Earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award for pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If a claim for disability compensation is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of entitlement is the day following separation or the date entitlement arose; otherwise, it is the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

As of March 24, 2015, a claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received. 

In this case, the Veteran submitted a claim for entitlement to service connection for alcohol abuse in December 2015. The Veteran also submitted an intent to file a claim in December 2021. In January 2022, within one year of submission of the intent to file, the Veteran submitted a claim for entitlement to service connection for anxiety and depression. Therefore, the Veteran's claim is deemed to have been received in December 2021, the date of receipt of the intent to file a claim. As such, the Veteran submitted his claims for entitlement to service connection for anxiety, depression, and alcohol abuse disorder within one year of his separation from military service.

In April 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision that granted service connection for alcohol abuse disorder and denied service connection for anxiety and depression. In July 2022, the Veteran submitted a claim for an increased rating for alcohol abuse disorder and a supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection for anxiety and depression. In a July 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for anxiety and depression. In an October 2022 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 10 percent rating for alcohol abuse disorder. 

The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in June 2023 for an initial rating higher than 10 percent for his psychiatric condition. In June 2023, the AOJ granted an increased rating of 30 percent for anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder effective July 17, 2021, the day after the Veteran's separation from military service. Essentially, this was a grant of entitlement to service connection for anxiety and depression, as well as a grant of the earliest available effective date for the grant of service connection. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim for entitlement to a higher initial rating for anxiety with depression and alcohol use disorder. In January 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision granting a 100 percent rating for anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder. In May 2024, the Veteran submitted his substantive appeal (VA Form 10182) to the Board for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the increased rating for anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder.

Under the AMA, if a claimant continues to request an available review option within one year of each prior decision on an issue, the claimant can preserve the effective date associated with the initial claim. To use supplemental claims to continuously pursue review of an issue and thereby protect the earliest possible effective date in the event of an award of benefits, the supplemental claims must be filed within one year of notification of the last agency of original jurisdiction or Board decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

In this case, the Veteran continually pursued his claims of service connection and a higher initial rating for anxiety, depression, and alcohol use disorder since the submission of his initial claim in December 2021. As such, the grant of the 100 percent rating for his anxiety with depression and alcohol use disorder could potentially reach back to July 17, 2021, the day after the Veteran's separation from military service. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). 

In December 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA mental disorders examination. However, that examination only considered the Veteran's alcohol abuse disorder rather than all potential psychiatric conditions. Therefore, the symptoms of his anxiety and depression were not addressed. As such, the Board finds the December 2021 VA mental disorders inadequate for rating purposes. Once VA has provided a VA examination, it is required to provide an adequate one, regardless of whether it was legally obligated to provide an examination in the first place. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

The Veteran has not undergone another VA mental disorders examination considering his anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder. Therefore, the Board has scrutinized the VA medical records in an effort to determine the severity of the Veteran's anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder since July 17, 2021. Although the VA mental health records provide some insight into the nature of the Veteran's psychiatric condition, they do not provide sufficient information to fully assess his symptoms throughout the period on appeal. The VA mental health records primarily demonstrate that the Veteran has had ongoing struggles with anxiety and depression that caused him to self-medicate with alcohol and marijuana. Scant information of the Veteran's specific symptoms was provided to appropriately assess the severity of his anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.

In September 2023, a private Mental Health Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) was submitted. The private practitioner provided specific findings of the Veteran's symptomology. It was explained that the Veteran had ongoing and worsening symptoms of depression and anxiety that started during deployment in the military. During service, he used alcohol to self-medicate and he continues to use alcohol ineffectively to self-medicate. It was noted that he witnessed traumatic events while serving in the military; the flashbacks and impaired sleeping triggered his anxiety and depression. The examiner opined that the Veteran's anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder have caused total occupational and social impairment. Based on this assessment, the AOJ granted a 100 percent rating for anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9413.

The Board finds the September 2023 private Mental Health DBQ to be the most probative evidence of record for assessing the severity of the Veteran's anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder throughout the period on appeal. The private practitioner carefully reviewed the case file, examined the Veteran, provided the specific symptoms associated with the psychiatric condition, and provided a sound rationale for the findings based on the evidence and examination. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). 

Although a retrospective opinion may be necessary in some instances where the record lacks medical evidence for the relevant time period, here, such an opinion would only call for further speculation of what the Veteran has experienced over the course of the extended period on appeal. Such action is unnecessary where the record contains an adequate opinion upon which the Board may render a decision. See Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80 (2008) (retrospective medical opinions are permitted in determining disability ratings); Vigil v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 63 (2008) (holding that the duty to assist may include development of medical evidence through a retrospective medical evaluation where there is a lack of medical evidence for the relevant time period).

In this case, a June 2022 primary care note reveals that the Veteran had trouble with anxiety and depression and that he was self-treating with alcohol. The Veteran reported that he began struggling with anxiety and depression since his first year in the Marines. See Mental Health Note, August 17, 2022. Since release from service, he continued to drink heavily, struggle with anxious and depressed mood, and began smoking marijuana daily. See Id. The August 2022 mental health note also revealed that the Veteran had numerous issues due to separation from active duty and his divorce. Thus, the Veteran has continued to struggle with anxiety and depression since during his military service, for which he has self-medicated by the consumption of alcohol.

As the September 2023 Mental Health DBQ is the most probative evidence of record for assessing the severity of the Veteran's anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder, that DBQ and the VA medical records show that he has had continuing struggles in this regard since service, the Mental Health DBQ was performed relatively close to the date of his separation from service, and remand for a retrospective opinion would only call for further speculation of what the Veteran has experienced over the course of the period on appeal, the Board finds that the September 2023 Mental Health DBQ is applicable to the entire period on appeal.

Accordingly, affording the Veteran all benefit of the doubt, entitlement to an effective date of July 17, 2021, for the grant of a 100 percent rating for anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder is granted.

Earlier effective date for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA

The issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA is part and parcel of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for his anxiety with depression and alcohol abuse disorder. Entitlement to basic eligibility for DEA under Chapter 35, Title 38, of the United States Code, is a program of education or special restorative training that may be authorized for an eligible person, such as a surviving spouse, if the applicable criteria are met. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501; 38 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.3020, 21.3021.

Basic eligibility for certification of DEA exists if the Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service, and either (1) has a permanent total service-connected disability, or (2) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death, or (3) died as a result of a service-connected disability, or, if a service member (4) is on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces and, for a period of more than 90 days, has been listed by VA concerned as missing in action, captured in line of duty by a hostile force, or forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by a foreign government or power. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

The AOJ awarded the Veteran eligibility to DEA effective September 7, 2023, based upon the grant of a 100 percent rating for his psychiatric condition. Because the Veteran, per this decision, has been granted a 100 percent rating for his psychiatric condition from July 17, 2021, the earliest date at which the Veteran could establish eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits is July 17, 2021.

Accordingly, entitlement to an effective date of July 17, 2021, for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA, is granted.

SMC based on housebound status

As the Veteran has been granted a 100 percent rating for his service-connected psychiatric condition, the issue of entitlement to SMC based on housebound status has been raised as part and parcel of the increased rating claim for his psychiatric condition. SMC is payable at a specified rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) when a Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and: (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or, (2) is permanently housebound due to a service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

Although, per this decision, the Veteran has been granted a 100 percent rating for a single service-connected disability, the Veteran does not have additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems. Furthermore, nothing in the record demonstrates that the Veteran is permanently housebound due to his service-connected disabilities.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran does not meet the requirements for SMC based on housebound status and the claim must be denied.
