ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 3, 2022, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The earliest date of entitlement for the Veteran's claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is August 3, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 3, 2022, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder have not been met.  38?U.S.C. §§?5107; 5110;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from August 1977 to February 1996.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).  The Veteran timely appealed the rating decision by submitting a VA Form 10182 and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the Veterans Appeals Improvement Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA).  Under direct review, the Board cannot hold a hearing or accept additional evidence into the record.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301 (2019).  Therefore, the Board will consider the evidence of record as of February 9, 2024, the date of the notification letter for the rating decision on appeal.  Id.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 3, 2022, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is denied.

The effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.? 38?U.S.C. §?5110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.400.  If the claim for service connection is received within one year of a veteran's discharge from service, the effective date of an award of service connection will be the day following discharge from service or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.? 38?U.S.C. §?5110?(b)(1);?38?C.F.R. §?3.400(b)(2). 

On August 3, 2022, VA recognized that the Veteran filed an intent to file that day, and was advised that a standard application must be received within one year from the date of receipt of the intent to file to preserve the date of claim.  On July 27, 2023, the Veteran, in pertinent part, submitted a claim for service connection for bipolar disorder.  See July 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).  In a February 2024 rating decision, the RO granted the claim of service connection for bipolar disorder and assigned a 30 percent rating, effective August 3, 2022 (the date VA received the request for an informal claim).  

The Veteran then filed a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), in July 2024, listing "effective date" as the area of disagreement.  He did not provide any argument as to why an earlier effective date would be warranted for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. 

The Board notes that the Veteran has not previously filed any intent to file or claim for service connection for any condition.  As noted above, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.? 38?U.S.C. §?5110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.400.  Because the Veteran submitted his claim in August 2022, that date is preserved as the effective date.  While the Board sympathizes with the Veteran, the evidence and the law do not support the assignment of an effective date earlier than August 3, 2022, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, and the appeal for an?earlier effective date?is denied.
