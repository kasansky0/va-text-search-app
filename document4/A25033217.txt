ORDER

The application to revise an August 30, 2013 rating decision (August 2013 decision), based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE), which denied service connection for nerve damage to the back and legs, under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran did not appeal the August 2013 decision. Thus, the decision became final. 

2. The Veteran has not established that the correct facts, as then known, were not before the RO at the time of the August 2013 decision, or that the RO incorrectly applied the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions existing at the time of that decision, with regard to the denial of benefits sought on appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The August 2013 rating decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 4005(c) (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 19.118, 19.153 (2012).

2. The criteria for revision on the grounds of CUE, of the August 2013 rating decision, that denied service connection for nerve damage to the back and legs, under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1151, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.361 (2012).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Army from November 1976 to August 1983; and from November 1990 to May 1991.

The Veteran's claim originates from a December 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO). 

In the January 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. No such evidence was submitted.

CUE

1. The application to revise an August 2013 decision, based on CUE, which denied service connection for nerve damage to the back and legs, under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, is denied.

The Veteran contends the back and nerve damage due to his legs should be service-connected, under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, and that the August 2013 rating decision which denied the claim must be revised based on CUE.

CUE Law 

Previous determinations that are final and binding, including decisions of service connection and other matters, will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE. Where evidence establishes such error, the prior rating decision will be reversed or amended. For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a).

CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error." It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE. Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error." Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993). In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different. Id., at 44.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that there is a three-pronged test to determine whether CUE is present in a prior determination: (1) "[e]ither the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before the adjudicator (i.e., more than a simple disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated) or the statutory or regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied," (2) the error must be "undebatable" and of the sort "which, had it not been made, would have manifestly changed the outcome at the time it was made," and (3) a determination that there was CUE must be based on the record and law that existed at the time of the prior adjudication in question. Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994) (quoting Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992) (en banc)).

The Court has held that allegations that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of clear and unmistakable error. See Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1, 5 (1999); Damrel, 6 Vet. App. at 246.

If a veteran wishes to reasonably raise a claim of CUE, there must be some degree of specificity as to what the alleged error is and, unless it is the kind of error that, if true, would be CUE on its face, persuasive reasons must be given as to why one would be compelled to reach the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error. Bustos v. West, 179 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967 (1999); Fugo, 6 Vet. App. at 43-44. If the error alleged is not the type of error that, if true, would be CUE on its face, if the veteran is only asserting disagreement with how the RO evaluated the facts before it, or if the veteran has not expressed with specificity how the application of cited laws and regulations would dictate a "manifestly different" result, the claim must be denied or the appeal to the Board terminated because of the absence of legal merit or the lack of entitlement under the law. Luallen v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 92 (1995); Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377, 384 (1994). Further, VA's failure in the duty to assist cannot constitute CUE. See Cook v. Principi, 318 F.3d 1334, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

Finality

Prior to addressing the merits of the Veteran's claim, the Board must first address whether the August 2013 decision is final. An assertion of CUE is a collateral attack on an otherwise final decision by the RO or Board. Smith v. Brown, 35 F.3d 1516, 1527 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Here, the Veteran did not appeal the August 2013 rating decision nor did the Veteran submit any new and material evidence within one year of the rating decision which might render the decision non-final. 

In the Veteran's July 2021 CUE Motion, the Veteran, through his representative, contends "it is apparent that VA does not have all of [the Veteran's] service treatment records (STRs)." Had additional STRs been associated with the file, this could invoke the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §3.156(c). However, no additional service records were associated with the file. Nor does the representative clarify how this would impact the analysis of CUE. 

Thus, the Board finds the August 2013 decision to be final and will address the merits of the Veteran's claim. 

Legal Criteria and merits

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, when a veteran suffers a qualifying additional disability or death as the result of hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, or training and rehabilitation services, furnished by VA, compensation will be awarded in the same manner as if such additional disability or death were service-connected. 38 U.S.C. § 1151; 38 C.F.R. § 3.361.

The Board notes that while there are additional provisions which govern entitlement to compensation under § 1151, the Board will not embark on an analysis of those elements because the Veteran's contentions, through his private representative, focus on whether the care was VA-provided. 

As explained in the July 2021 CUE motion: "[VA] referred [the Veteran] to the University of Illinois Radiation Oncology Department for treatment of his prostate cancer and PAID THE BILL. Therefore, to deny [the Veteran] VA benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 was erroneous..."

The Board notes that it was not until 2017 that benefits could be granted on a referral theory involving an unforeseeable event under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 where VA medical care proximately caused the medical treatment or care during which an event occurs that proximately causes additional disability. Thus, where VA refers veterans for private treatment, negligence or other fault of VA in making the referral or an event not reasonably foreseeable during the subsequent private treatment could result in compensation for any resulting disability or death of the Veteran. Ollis v. Shulkin, 857 F.3d 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2017).

A determination that there was CUE must be based on the record and law that existed at the time of the prior adjudication in question. Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994) (quoting Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992) (en banc)). As Ollis, became law in 2017 it was not current law in August 2013 and the Board may not consider it. 

Here, it is undisputed that the Veteran received his radiation treatment at a non-VA facility. Thus, the criteria for service connection for nerve damage to the back and legs, under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, were not met at the time of the August 2013 decision. 

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran has not shown the August 2013 decision to contain an error of fact that compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error or that the law was misapplied. Hence, the Veteran's CUE motion is denied.

The Board notes that neither the Veteran, nor his representative, appealed the non-CUE determination of whether service connection under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 was warranted. Thus, the Board may not address that claim herein, to include whether service connection is warranted, under a referral theory. Ollis, supra. While continuously pursuing the claim is no longer an option, the Veteran may file another CUE motion, this time identifying the error in the December 2021 decision as not considering 38 U.S.C. § 1151 under a referral theory.
