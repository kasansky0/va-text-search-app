DOCKET NO. 230505-413194
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal seeking payment of medical expenses incurred on December 6, 2022, at Four Town First Aid Squad, Inc. under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the claim for payment of medical expenses incurred on December 6, 2022, at Four Town First Aid Squad, Inc. under CHAMPVA was reprocessed and approved by VA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal is moot and must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, Four Town First Aid Squad, Inc., provided medical services to the Veteran's wife on December 6, 2022.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 26, 2023, determination made by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

The AOJ originally denied the appellant's claim for payment for the services under CHAMPVA on the basis that the care may be covered by another payer per coordination of benefits, and that the AOJ had incomplete or invalid plan information for the other insurance.  See January 26, 2023, Explanation of Benefits (EOB).  

However, during the pendency of this appeal, the claim was administratively reviewed, and the initial denial was overturned.  See February 27, 2025, VHA Correspondence.    

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5), the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  Given that the denial of the claim was reversed, there remains no adverse action with regard to medical treatment provided by the appellant.  In other words, there is no case or controversy for the Board to adjudicate, and the appropriate course of action is to dismiss the present appeal as moot.  Cardona v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 472, 474 (2014) (citing Padgett v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 159, 164 (2008) (en banc)).  Accordingly, the claim is dismissed.
