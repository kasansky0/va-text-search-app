ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable initial rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis symptoms did not have 50 percent obstruction on both sides of his nasal passages or complete obstruction of the nasal passage on one side.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable rating for the Veteran's allergic rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran has active service in the Unites States Army from July 2003 to May 2011. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Higher evaluations may be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). This practice is known as staged ratings. Id.; see also Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007). The determination of whether an increased disability rating is warranted is to be based on a review of the entire evidence of record and the application of all pertinent regulations. See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).

The Board considers not only the criteria of the currently assigned DCs, but also the criteria of other potentially applicable DCs. In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. However, the evaluation of the same "disability" or the same "manifestations" under various diagnoses is not allowed. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. A claimant may not be compensated twice for the same symptomatology as "such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment of his earning capacity." See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993). This would result in pyramiding, contrary to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. However, if a Veteran has separate and distinct manifestations attributable to the same injury, they should be compensated under different diagnostic codes. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994); Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225, 230 (1993).

When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is in approximate balance). In applying the benefit of the doubt rule, the Board is required to assign probative weight to relevant evidence, make a specific finding as to which evidence the Board finds more persuasive, and provide the reasoning for such finding. Bufkin v. McDonough, 75 F.4th 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis

The Veteran contends that the severity of the symptoms of his allergic rhinitis warrant more than a noncompensable disability rating. In the December 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for allergic rhinitis. 

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is currently rated under DC 6522. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522. For VA compensation purposes, under DC 6522, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where the evidence shows allergic rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side, and a 30 percent rating is merited for allergic rhinitis with polyps.

In August 2023 the Veteran submitted a Statement in Support of Claim indicating that he constantly has hay fever and that he receives medications from the VA for treatment of his hay fever. 

A January 2016 note reflects that the Veteran has chronic rhinitis with seasonal allergies. In an October 2019 outpatient clinic note, the clinician noted no loss of smell, no epistaxis, and no postnasal drip.  In a November 2022 clinic visit with examination, the Veteran had no nasal discharge or obstruction. The Veteran's records reflect rhinitis as an active problem. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA Sinusitis/Rhinitis examination in December 2023 during which the examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The Veteran offered complaints of nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itching for which he takes Cetirizine daily, as needed. Upon examination, the Veteran did not have greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides due to rhinitis, complete obstruction on one side due to rhinitis, nasal polyps, granulomatous conditions, a neoplasm, or deviated nasal septum. The examiner did observe permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates. 

The Board recognizes that the Veteran's belief that the severity of his symptoms are greater than his noncompensable disability rating indicates. In addition, the Veteran is competent to report experiencing symptoms of seasonal hay fever and being prescribed medication for treatment of his symptoms. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994) (lay testimony is competent as to symptoms of an injury or illness, which are within the realm of one's personal knowledge, personal knowledge is that which comes to the witness through the use of the senses). However, a clinical assessment of the Veteran's rhinitis is complex, and requires advanced medical training which the Veteran has not been shown evidence of having the advanced medical education and training required to diagnose and assess the severity of medical conditions under the criteria of the VA Rating Schedule for disabilities. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). Therefore, the Board assigns greater weight to the notes of his treating clinicians and the findings of the December 2023 VA examiner than to the Veteran's lay belief.  

The Board finds that while the evidence shows permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, the examination did not show that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis disability warranted a 10 percent disability rating at any point during the period on appeal with a 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, complete obstruction on either side, or a 30 percent rating with nasal polyps. 

Accordingly, the weight of the evidence is persuasively against an increased disability rating for the Veteran's allergic rhinitis. As there are no doubts to be resolved, the claim is denied.
