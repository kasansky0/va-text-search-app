REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is remanded.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from March 1998 to April 2018.  

In June 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for erectile dysfunction.  In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, VA Form 20-0996.  In October 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for erectile dysfunction.  In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, as the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  

The Board observes that the October 2024, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, cites the date of the decision being appealed as June 2023.  In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, VA Form 20-0996.  The October 2024, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182 was received by VA more than a year after the June 2023 Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision.  As such the Board has construed the October 2024 VA Form 10182 as disagreeing with the October 2023, Agency of Original Jurisdiction higher level review decision.  

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is remanded.  

In his April 2023 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran reported that the service connected psychiatric disability "caused the inability to achieve and maintain an erection."  

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should obtain all relevant private treatment records which could potentially be helpful in resolving the Veteran's claims. Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78 (1990); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).  

A September 2020 VA treatment record states that the Veteran was being treated by a Dr. Holzer, a private urologist.  A January 2023 VA treatment record states that the Veteran underwent "laser surgery 2022 for post-ejaculation bleeding."  Clinical documentation of the cited 2020 and 2022 private urological treatment is not of record.  That is a pre decisional error.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for Dr. Holzer as to the cited 2020 urological treatment and the healthcare provider who performed the 2022 laser surgery.  Make two requests for the authorized records 

 

from all identified healthcare providers unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.
