ORDER

Service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

Service connection for erectile dysfunction is dismissed.

REMANDED

Service connection for sleep apnea syndrome is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea syndrome, hypertension and erectile dysfunction on January 5, 2024.  

2. On January 16, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim seeking review of the adjudication of the issues of service connection for hypertension and erectile dysfunction.

3. While the January 16, 2024 Supplemental Claim was still pending adjudication by the AOJ for the issues of service connection for hypertension and erectile dysfunction, the Veteran filed the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal NOD review of the adjudication of the issue of service connection for sleep apnea syndrome and impermissibly seeking concurrent review of the adjudication of the issues of service connection for hypertension and erectile dysfunction.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the claim for service connection for hypertension are met.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §3.2500.  

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction are met.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1983 to May 1991.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Dismissal of Claims

1. Service connection for hypertension

2. Service connection for erectile dysfunction

The appeals for service connection for hypertension and service connection for erectile dysfunction must be dismissed because they result from a prohibited concurrent election under the modernized review system.

As a general matter, within one year of the date the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issues a decision, a claimant may elect one of three review options, or lanes: (i) Higher-Level Review by the AOJ; (ii) Supplemental Claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1).  If a request for review under one of these three lanes is pending final adjudication, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), 20.205.

After a claimant elects one of the three available review options, the claimant may not take another action with respect to the same claim until the Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is adjudicated; or the elected request for Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is withdrawn.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

Here, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea syndrome, hypertension and erectile dysfunction on January 5, 2024.  On January 16, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim seeking review of the adjudication of the issues of service connection for hypertension and erectile dysfunction.  While the January 16, 2024 Supplemental Claim was still pending adjudication by the AOJ for the issues of service connection for hypertension and erectile dysfunction, the Veteran filed the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal NOD review of the adjudication of the issue of service connection for sleep apnea syndrome and impermissibly seeking concurrent review of the adjudication of the issues of service connection for hypertension and erectile dysfunction.  In response to the January 2024 supplemental claim, the AOJ issued an August 2024 rating decision.

Because the AOJ review had not yet been completed, and the Veteran did not withdraw his January 2024 supplemental claim, the Board should not have accepted the July 2024 VA Form 10182 because it was an impermissible concurrent election with respect to the issues of service connection for hypertension and erectile dysfunction.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

The July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, NOD was docketed in error with respect to the issues of service connection for hypertension and erectile dysfunction.  The Board may dismiss an appeal for a procedural defect, such as improper docketing of an appeal.  See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).  Accordingly, the Board finds that dismissal of the claims is warranted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for sleep apnea syndrome is remanded.

The Board is not able to make a fully informed decision regarding the issue of service connection for sleep apnea syndrome.

The Veteran contends that sleep apnea syndrome is due to toxic exposure risk activities during active service and/or secondary to service-connected allergic rhinitis.  July 10, 2023, VA 21-526EZ.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2023.  The examiner opined that there is no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication of a relationship between the development of sleep apnea and the toxic exposure risk activity.  The Board finds that remand is required to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  The AOJ failed to obtain an opinion to address the Veteran's contention that sleep apnea syndrome is secondary to service-connected allergic rhinitis.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from the appropriate clinician regarding the nature and etiology of sleep apnea syndrome.  The need for an in-person examination is left to the discretion of the examiner.  The examiner should review the claims file and address the following:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, i.e., nearly equal) that sleep apnea syndrome is due to service-connected allergic rhinitis (i.e., but for the service-connected allergic rhinitis, the Veteran would not have sleep apnea syndrome).  

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, i.e., nearly equal) that sleep apnea syndrome is aggravated by service-connected allergic rhinitis (i.e., sleep apnea syndrome would be less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the Veteran's service-connected allergic rhinitis) either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected allergic rhinitis resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected sleep apnea syndrome.

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report in-service events, his symptoms and history.  Such reports must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinions.  Lay statements of record cannot be disregarded solely due to lack of contemporaneous medical evidence.

(Continued on the next page)

?

A thorough rationale, to include reference to relevant evidence of record as appropriate, should be provided for all opinions expressed.  If the examiner is unable to provide a requested opinion, a supporting rationale must be given concerning why the opinion cannot be provided.
