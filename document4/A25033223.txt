ORDER

Service connection for osteoarthritis of the right hip status post right hip arthroplasty is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right hip osteoarthritis status post right hip arthoplasty is proximately due to an injury to his right hip in service and participation in activities to earn the Parachutists Badge and the Air Assault Badge. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for osteoarthritis of the right hip have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1985 to August 1993. See DD-214.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection for osteoarthritis of the right hip

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for disability caused by disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  To establish service connection for a claimed disability, there must be evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999).

Establishing secondary service connection requires evidence: (1) of a current disability (for which secondary service connection is sought); (2) of a service-connected disability; and (3) that the current disability was either caused or aggravated by the service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Arthritis is an enumerated condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Walker, 708 F.3d 1331. 

Contemporaneous medical evidence is not required under 38 CFR 3.303(b) to find that a chronic disease was "noted" in service or within a presumptive period for purposes of continuity of symptomatology. "[A]s long as the condition is noted at the time the veteran was in service such noting need not be reflected in any written documentation (other than as required to be in a format sufficient for inclusion as part of the record and proceedings before the Secretary and the Board) ... either contemporaneous to service or otherwise." Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 496 (1997).

Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (footnote omitted). Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2).

Factual Background

During active service, the Veteran completed Airborne School and earned the Parachutist Badge and the Air Assault Badge. See DD-214.

In May 1985, the Veteran reported injury during physical training when he fell backward onto a log and landed on his back. He reported right hip pain, right lower back pain, and neck pain. See May 1985 service treatment records. 

In August 2021, the Veteran reported that pain in his right hip started six months prior and had worsened. K.M.N., P.A., diagnosed the Veteran with osteoarthritis of the right hip and trochanteric bursitis of the right hip. An x-ray revealed end-stage, bone-on-bone osteoarthritis with complete loss of joint space, subchondral sclerosis, peripheral osteophyte formation, and cam lesion. K.M.N. attributed right hip pain to end-stage osteoarthritis. See December 2023 private medical treatment records.

The Veteran sought conservative treatment for the osteoarthritis in his right hip until December 2022 when the Veteran underwent a total arthroplasty on his right hip. See December 2023 private medical records.

Dr. J.H.H. treated the Veteran for more than 15 years. In February 2023, Dr. J.H.H. reviewed the Veteran's in-service treatment records and considered the Veteran's service in the 101st Airborne Division and participation in the Army's Airborne School. Dr. J.H.H. noted that the Veteran did not have any other known risk factors for the [right] hip pain. Dr. J.H.H. opined that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's condition was a result of the Veteran's active-duty service and the injuries incurred during service. See December 2023 private treatment records.

In the June 2023 VA opinion, the examiner, C.M.M., NP, stated that the Veteran had right hip pain in May 1985, but did not have any additional records of right hip pain during service. See June 2023 VA opinion. C.M.M. also noted that the Veteran was treated in 2018 for osteoarthritis, and that there had been no "nexus" of care and treatment for 33 years. Based on these factors, C.M.M. opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's right hip osteoarthritis was due to service. See id.

In January 2024, D.T., APRN-CNP, FNP, performed a VA examination on the Veteran. D.T. opined that the Veteran's right hip arthroplasty was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected condition of degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis) of the thoracolumbar spine because degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine does not directly cause the other. See January 2024 VA opinion. D.T. further opined that degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine does not cause the need for hip arthroplasty. See id. However, D.T. noted that the two conditions can coexist due to shared risk factors and potential biomechanical compensations. See id.

During the January 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported that the onset of the right hip pain was in 1985 when he fell on an obstacle course. He also noted that the condition worsened over the years, and that he constantly uses a cane.

The Veteran submitted a lay statement in which he described the May 1985 injury on the obstacle course and said he was referred to physical therapy. See May 2023 Veteran's lay statement. Following the injury, he took numerous ice baths and was prescribed medication and physical therapy. He said that the pain covered more than 25 years, and, in that time, he had several doctors treat his condition with continuous medications for pain and inflammation and physical therapy. He underwent injections and a right hip arthroplasty (hip replacement). The right hip condition prevented him from completing routine tasks, like yardwork, and kept him from activities, such as sports with his children. Before the injury, he ran marathons and was an active swimmer. See id.

The Veteran's spouse also provided a lay statement. See May 2023 Spouse's lay statement. She reported having been married to the Veteran for over 25 years and watched him suffer various stages of hip pain. See id.

Analysis

The Board grants direct service connection because the Veteran has a current diagnosis of right hip osteoarthritis status post right hip arthroplasty; the Veteran had an in-service injury in May 1985 and other activities that more likely than not worsened his right hip condition; and the private medical opinion of Dr. J.H.H., linking the current condition to the in-service events.

The Board notes that it could also grant direct service connection on a presumptive basis because arthritis is an enumerated chronic condition and the lay evidence and the medical evidence support continuous symptoms since service.

The Board assigns probative weight to the February 2023 opinion of Dr. J.H.H. on direct service connection due to his more than 15-year treating relationship with the Veteran, his review of the Veteran's service treatment records, the Veteran's in-service experience with 101st Airborne Division and participation in the Army's Airborne School, and the Veteran's lack of other risk factors for osteoarthritis in his right hip.

The Board finds that the June 2023 VA opinion from C.M.M. on direct service connection is due no weight because the rationale relies on a lack of service treatment records after the May 1985 incident and private medical records after service until 2018. The rationale does not consider all the evidence, including the Veteran's experience in earning the Parachutist Badge and the Air Assault Badge, nor does it factor in the lay statements from the Veteran and his spouse.

The Board affords no weight to the January 2024 VA opinion from D.T. on secondary service connection because it is based on a limited portion of the Veteran's right hip condition and contradictory. The opinion only addressed whether there was a secondary service connection between the right hip arthroplasty and the degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine. The opinion did not address the entire right hip condition, especially the osteoarthritis of the right hip that led to the arthroplasty. The opinion is contradictory because the examiner concedes that biomechanical compensations could have contributed to the right hip condition, but the opinion does not explain why they did not.

While few treatment records exist between 1985 and 2022, the Board finds that the Veteran continued to experience the same and worsening symptoms from May 1985 to the present. The Veteran is competent to report symptoms of pain, limitation on activities, and using assistive devices during that period. The Veteran's statements are credible and entitled to probative weight, as they are internally consistent and consistent with other evidence of record, which shows that these symptoms were attributable to the Veteran's right hip osteoarthritis.

The Veteran's spouse is also competent to report observable symptoms, such as pain. The Veteran's spouse's statements are credible and entitled to probative weight because they are also internally consistent and consistent with other evidence of record.
