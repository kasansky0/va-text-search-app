ORDER

Service connection for schizoaffective disorder is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The probative evidence favors the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder being related to his service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for schizoaffective disorder are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2004 to July 2008.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2022, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In a January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or the Veteran's representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

Service Connection

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after military discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to the period of military service, establishes that the disease was incurred during active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(d).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.125, diagnoses of mental disorders are to conform to the DSM-5.  38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (incorporating by reference VA's adoption of the American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), for rating purposes).

By statute, all veterans are presumed to have entered service in sound condition except as to those defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of examination, acceptance, and enrollment.  38 U.S.C. § 1111.  If a condition was not noted at the time of entrance and is later noted in service, it is presumed to have arisen in and as a result of service unless clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that it existed before acceptance.  Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999) (explaining that clear and unmistakable evidence means evidence that "cannot be misinterpreted and misunderstood").

If a condition first noted in service is nevertheless shown by clear and unmistakable evidence to have preexisted service, it is presumed to have been aggravated in service.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.  To rebut the presumption of soundness where a condition is first noted in service, the Secretary must point to clear and unmistakable evidence that the condition both preexisted and was not aggravated by service.  Id.  To show that a preexisting condition first noted in service was not aggravated by service, the evidence must clearly and unmistakably demonstrate that either there was no increase in the disability in service or that any increase in disability was the result of the natural process of the condition.  Joyce v. Nicholson, 443 F.3d 845, 847 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Whether the record contains clear and unmistakable evidence sufficient to rebut the presumptions of soundness and aggravation is subject to de novo review by the Court.  See Cotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116, 130 (2003).  However, in making this determination, the Court must give deferential treatment to the Board's underlying factual findings and determinations of credibility.  Vanerson, 12 Vet. App. at 261 ("The Court has repeatedly held that it reviews de novo whether the facts found by the Board amount to clear and unmistakable evidence, while giving deferential treatment to the Board's underlying factual findings and determinations of credibility.").

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the claimant prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Service connection for schizoaffective disorder is granted.

The Veteran contends that he has schizoaffective disorder due to his service.  He reports that excessive stress while aboard ship led to hallucinations, including visions of murdering his chief, and violence towards others, which had not occurred prior to service.  July 2022 Claim; September 2022 VA Medical Opinion.

The October 2022 rating decision made a favorable finding that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and that a qualifying injury, disease, or event had its onset during service.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

The Board notes that because the claimed schizoaffective disorder was not noted on the Veteran's enlistment examination report, the presumption of soundness attaches, and it may be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable (i.e. undebatable) evidence that his schizoaffective disorder was both preexisting and not aggravated by his service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).

A September 2022 VA examiner rendered a negative nexus opinion for service connection for schizoaffective disorder, opining that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder was incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, disease, or event.  In support of his opinion, the VA examiner indicated that research asserts that schizoaffective disorder has a basis in genetics and neurochemistry and is often triggered by childhood trauma and stressful life events.  The VA examiner further averred that the Veteran has the genetic components, as both of his parents have serious, chronic mental health issues and substance use issues and the Veteran's childhood was filled with emotional abuse.  Considering the genetic history and the Veteran's admission that he had issues with depression from an early age due to his difficult upbringing, the VA examiner opined that the presumption of soundness should not be considered and issued a negative nexus opinion.  Although opining that the schizoaffective disorder preexisted service, the VA examiner did not issue any opinion as to whether the schizoaffective disorder was aggravated in service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b); see also Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.

In a February 2023 private medical opinion (submitted in March 2023), psychologist J.G., indicated that the Veteran meets the full diagnostic criteria for schizoaffective disorder, consistent with the DSM-5, and concluded that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder is at least as likely as not due to or emerged during military service.  In support of the opinion, J.G. discussed how the Veteran's first documentation of symptoms and mental health treatment occurred during military service in 2006.  J.G. also provided medical literature regarding the pathophysiology of schizoaffective disorder.  Regarding soundness at the time of entry to service, J.G. rebuts the September 2023 medical opinion by noting that the Veteran was found fit for duty at the time of enlistment and there are no records which clearly and unmistakably establish that a mental illness was present but undiagnosed prior to service.  Additionally, per J.G., records, the Veteran's self-report, and the examination by the VA psychologist all establish that prior to service, despite the complex nature of the Veteran's childhood, the Veteran had friends, engaged in social hobbies and recreation, graduated on-time from high school, and held part-time employment.  There is no documented evidence of any symptoms, treatment or diagnosis related to mental health prior to service, which was confirmed further during J.G.'s examination of the Veteran.  J.G. further notes that it is not in dispute that any disorder has a genetic component, as genetic factors and environmental factors may play a role in predicting disorders; however, genetic predispositions for a myriad of disorders may or may not ever manifest across a person's life.  J.G. cites research that indicates that the rates of developing a psychotic disorder amongst parents or first-degree relatives is anything but causal or a one-to-one relationship, with most research estimating the risk being between six percent and fifteen percent, and that the environment and other factors are critical.  J.G. further notes that there is no military genetic testing or standards in place.  He concludes by averring that the Veteran was found fit for duty at the time of enlistment and had documented emergent mental health symptoms during service which have been consistently present following service, thus it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder is due to or emerged due to military service.  The February 2023 opinion had a clear conclusion and rationale based on the provider's examination of the Veteran's military and medical history and it serves to link the schizoaffective disorder to the Veteran's service.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  Therefore, the Board assigns this opinion substantial probative weight.

The Board finds that the September 2022 VA examiner's opinion as to a preexisting condition is insufficient to rebut the presumption of soundness.  Clear and unmistakable evidence is an onerous evidentiary standard, requiring that the preexistence of a condition and the no-aggravation result be "undebatable." Cotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003); Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 396 (2009) (noting that clear and undebatable means that the evidence cannot be misinterpreted or misunderstood).  As the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted, the Veteran's claim is one for direct service connection.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1089.

Accordingly, as the February 2023 opinion is the most probative opinion evidence of record and relates the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder to his service, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that service connection for schizoaffective disorder is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  His appeal is granted.
