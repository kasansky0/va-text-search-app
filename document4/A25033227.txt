ORDER

A 30 percent rating, but no higher, for bilateral hearing loss from May 3, 2023, through January 6, 2025, is granted, subject to the applicable laws and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.

A 40 percent rating, but no higher, for bilateral hearing loss from January 6, 2025, is granted, subject to the applicable laws and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the appeal period from May 3, 2023 through January 6, 2025, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his bilateral hearing loss approximated hearing acuity productive of level VI in the right ear and level VII in the left ear.

2. For the appeal period from January 6, 2025, evidence persuasively reflects the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss has been manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than level VIII in the right ear and no worse than level VII in the left ear.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a 30 percent rating, but no higher, for bilateral hearing loss, from May 3, 2023 through January 6, 2025 are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code (Code) 6100.

2. The criteria for a 40 percent rating, but no higher, for bilateral hearing loss from January 6, 2025 are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code (Code) 6100

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service in the United States Navy from April to September 1966.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision. The Veteran requested a higher level review (HLR) of this rating decision. The HLR decision denied the claims in May 2024, and the Veteran timely appealed the May 2024 rating decision to the Board, requesting the Hearing Lane Docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the January 6, 2025 hearing or within 90 days following the hearing (January 6, 2025-April 6, 2025). 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). A written transcript of this hearing has been associated with the evidence of record. 

The Board notes that the appeal is advanced on the docket due to the Veteran's advanced age, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800 (c).

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for his bilateral hearing loss. During an October 2023 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he had trouble understand words and that he read lips. Transcript (T.) at page (pg.) 3)).

Under the applicable criteria, ratings for hearing loss are determined in accordance with the findings obtained on audiometric evaluations. Ratings for hearing impairment range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of controlled speech discrimination tests, together with the average hearing threshold level as measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 cycles per second. To evaluate the degree of disability from hearing impairment, the rating schedule establishes eleven auditory acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal acuity through Level XI for profound deafness. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

Hearing tests will be conducted without hearing aids, and the results of above-described testing are charted on Table VI and Table VII. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

Exceptional patterns of hearing impairment are evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86.

(a) When the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz) is 55 decibels or more, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever results in the higher numeral. Each ear will be evaluated separately.

When the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever results in the higher numeral. That numeral will then be elevated to the next higher Roman numeral. Each ear will be evaluated separately.

As noted above, under VA rating criteria, an adequate evaluation of impairment of hearing acuity rests upon the results of controlled speech discrimination tests, together with tests of the average hearing threshold levels at certain specified frequencies. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

Pertinent case law provides that the assignment of disability ratings for hearing impairment is to be derived by the mechanical application of the Ratings Schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometry evaluations are rendered. Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

As this case is under the Appeals Modernization Act and based on the procedural history outlined showing continuous pursuit of the claim, the relevant review period for this increased rating claim is from May 3, 2023 (the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim for increased compensation for bilateral hearing loss) to September 12, 2023 (the date notification was mailed of the May 2023 rating decision) and any evidence received at the January 6, 2025 hearing and within 90 days of the hearing (i.e., January 6, 2025 to April 6, 2025). The Board has also considered whether an increase in disability occurred during the one year look back period prior to May 3, 2023 (i.e., May 3, 2022 to May 3, 2023). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (o)(2), 3.2500(h).

Pertinent evidence includes a May 2023 VA audiological evaluation. Audiometric testing to include, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, and speech recognition scores were reported as follows:

	HERTZ	CNC

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	%

RIGHT	40	45	65	85	59	60

LEFT	40	60	90	105+	74	60

With regard to a schedular rating, when applying the method for evaluating hearing loss to the results of the Veteran's audiological evaluation, the May 2023 audiometric evaluation revealed Level VI and VII hearing acuity in the right and left ears, respectively, based on application of the reported findings to Table VI. Application of these findings to Table VII corresponds to an initial 30 percent disability rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

As the May 2023 VA audiological evaluation does not reflect that the Veteran had 55 decibels or more in all pure tone thresholds of either ear from 1000-4000 Hertz, or 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, exceptional hearing impairment has not been demonstrated in either ear during any of these evaluations and, thus, 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 is not for application to the 2023 examination.

Pertinent evidence includes a January 6, 2025 private audiological evaluation. Audiometric testing to include, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, and speech recognition scores (using the Maryland CNC controlled speech recognition test) were reported as follows:

	HERTZ	CNC

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	%

RIGHT	35	50	65	85	59	50

LEFT	35	50	65	95	70	64

With regard to a schedular rating, when applying the method for evaluating hearing loss to the results of the Veteran's audiological evaluation, the January 6, 2025 private audiometric evaluation revealed Level VIII and VII hearing acuity in the right and left ears, respectively, based on application of the reported findings to Table VI. Application of these findings to Table VII corresponds to an initial 40 percent disability rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

As the January 6, 2025 VA audiological evaluation does not reflect that the Veteran had 55 decibels or more in all pure tone thresholds of either ear from 1000-4000 Hertz, or 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, exceptional hearing impairment has not been demonstrated in either ear during any of these evaluations and, thus, 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 is not for application to the January 2025 examination.

In Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015), the United States Court of Appeals (Court) held that the effective date for an increased rating for hearing loss can be earlier than the date the hearing test showing objective results was conducted. The Court explained that "the Board errs when it mechanically assigns the date of the VA examination as the effective date of the veteran's disability and fails to consider other medical or lay evidence of record dated prior to the examination." Id. Instead, the Board must examine all the facts, including lay statements and medical records, to consider whether it is factually ascertainable that the increased rating should be effective prior to the date of the VA exam. Id. 

The Board is satisfied that the probative evidence to support an award of a 30 percent rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss from the beginning of the rating period on appeal, beginning on May 3, 2023, the date of receipt of claim. The Board finds no significant contrary evidence weighing against an award of a 30 percent rating from the beginning of the rating period on appeal. While September 2022 private audiological tests are of record, the word recognition tests during these examinations did not use the Maryland CNC Test. As such, these private tests are inadequate for the purpose of loss for determining hearing impairment for VA purposes. Thus, the Board will award a 30 percent rating to the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss from May 3, 2023 through January 6, 2025, and a 40 percent therefrom.
