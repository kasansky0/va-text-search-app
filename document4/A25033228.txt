ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea with restrictive airway disease is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The November 2023 rating decision assigned an effective date of August 10, 2022, pursuant to The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

An effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea with restrictive airway disease is not warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114, 3.151, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1998 to June 2001 and from August 2004 to January 2006, with service in Iraq.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) issued rating a decision in November 2023.  In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

An earlier effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea with restrictive airway disease is denied.

The Veteran asserts his obstructive sleep apnea disability rating should have an earlier effective date based on the date of diagnosis and the date of initial claim for service connection.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182.

The general rule regarding effective dates is found at 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a): unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  The effective date of an award of service connection will be the day following the date of separation from service if the veteran filed a claim within one year after service; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(1).

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  There are specific provisions for claims regarding revision of a decision based on a supplemental claim and continuously pursued claims.  At any time after VA issues notice of a decision on an issue within a claim, a claimant may file a supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(2).

If a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession a supplemental claim, or other review options including a request a higher-level review, an appeal to the Board, or a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Continuous pursuit requires any review option be filed within one year of the issuance of the decision with which the Veteran disagrees.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  However, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a notice of a decision, or the Board issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

The Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea in June 2021.  The claim was denied in an August 2021 rating decision.  The Veteran filed supplemental claims in September 2021 and January 2022 which were denied in September 2021 and April 2022 rating decisions as the AOJ had determined the evidence was not new and relevant.  The Veteran did not appeal the April 2022 rating decision.  He did not file another application to reopen the claim within one year, nor was there a timely election of any other review option.  Furthermore, no new and relevant evidence was received within one year of the rating decision being issued.  As such, the April 2022 rating decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

In August 2022, the President signed into law the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act).  Of relevance, the PACT Act establishes presumptive diseases for in-service exposure to herbicide agents.  The Veteran filed a supplemental claim in August 2023 for obstructive sleep apnea.  In November 2023, the RO granted presumptive service connection effective August 10, 2022 for obstructive sleep apnea with restrictive airway disease due to the Veteran's toxic risk exposure in Iraq.

Claims granted under the PACT Act will be effective no earlier than August 10, 2022, the date of enactment.  An earlier effective date may be warranted, however, if the grant is based on another theory of entitlement, such as direct service connection, secondary service connection, or a presumption other than those established under the PACT Act.  The RO denied service connection based on other theories of entitlement in 2021.  The Veteran did not continuously pursue the claim and thus the rating decision was final.  The Veteran's claim was later granted based on PACT Act presumptions and thus is entitled to an August 10, 2022 effective date, no earlier.

Therefore, an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea with restrictive airway disease must be denied.
