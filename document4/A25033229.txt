REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for chronic sinusitis to include benign neoplasm of the sinus is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2024 decision. In May 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2024 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 decision. In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for chronic sinusitis to include benign neoplasm of the sinus is remanded.

In a November 2023 VA treatment note, the Veteran identified relevant outstanding private treatment records. The Veteran reported that he was seen by a local eye doctor and subsequent biopsy showed a benign neoplasm of the sinus. The only non-VA treatment record in the file is a single record dated in September 2023. The failure to attempt to obtain these records was a predecsional error. A remand is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these oustanding records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for Dr. Larsen and any other provider which treated his service-connected sinus disability. Make two requests for the authorized records from any identified provider, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.
