REMANDED

Entitlement to beneficiary travel benefits for travel to a medical appointment on September 6, 2024, is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from August 1961 to July 1964, from December 1964 to December 1967, and from July 1989 to September 1989.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 18, 2024 decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Beneficiary Travel Department.  

On November 25, 2024, VA received a VA Form 10182.  The Veteran selected the Direct Review lane and expressed disagreement with the September 18, 2024 decision.  Therefore, the Board's review is limited to evidence on record at the time of the September 18, 2024 decision.  38?C.F.R. §?20.301.

For the sake of clarity, under the Direct Review option, the Board may not consider evidence that accumulated after the September 18, 2024 decision (more precisely, the evidence which the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) considered in the decision).  Upon review of the record, there is no extant evidence which accumulated during this time frame.  See Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).  

As a final procedural observation, the instant appeal (advanced on the Board's docket) was assigned to the undersigned for review prior to expiration of the 60-day period following the November 25, 2024 VA Form 10182 and prior to expiration of the one-year period following the September 18, 2024 decision on appeal.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Pursuant to Williams, the Board sent the Veteran a letter on January 8, 2025 to solicit a waiver of the remaining period to request a different Board review option (docket type).  He did not respond, and 60 days have now passed since the November 25, 2024 VA Form 10182 was received.  Accordingly, the Board will proceed to review the appeal.  

Entitlement to beneficiary travel benefits for travel to a medical appointment on September 6, 2024.

Remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist omission.

Generally, VA beneficiary travel is a payment for travel expenses incurred in the United States to help Veterans and other persons obtain care or services from the Veterans Health Administration.  38 U.S.C. § 111; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10.  A Veteran is eligible for beneficiary travel payments for travel to or from a VA facility or VA-authorized health care facility for the following: (1) treatment for a service-connected disability, regardless of the disability rating; (2) treatment for any disability, provided that the Veteran has a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more; (3) a scheduled compensation and pension examination; (4) if the Veteran receives pension under 38 U.S.C. § 1521; (5) if the Veteran's annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension that the Veteran would receive under 38 U.S.C. § 1521; or (6) if the Veteran is unable to defray the expenses of that travel under certain circumstances.  38 U.S.C. § 111; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a).

Here, the Veteran contends that he is entitled to reimbursement for the cost of expenses related to a September 6, 2024 appointment at "UAMS", University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.  See VA Form 10-3542 (Claim for Reimbursement of Travel Expenses) dated September 6, 2024.  On his VA Form 10182, the Veteran also reported that "This appointment was ordered by VA for UAMS[.]"  

A September 6, 2024 VA treatment record reports that the status of the appointment was "Completed" but also states, "please contact to reschedule[.]"  It therefore appears the Veteran, or the VA clinic, cancelled a VA appointment scheduled for September 6, 2024.  However, the record does not contain private treatment records for September 6, 2024, which might show that he completed a medical appointment at UAMS.  Notably, the claims file contains VA treatment records through August 6, 2024, but not later.  Those records note the Veteran fell in May 2024 and injured his back, resulting in several non-displaced fractures.  See May 8, 2024 VA treatment record.  A May 14, 2024 record notes the Veteran's preference to be treated at UAMS and that a "Consult [was] forwarded to community care."  Importantly, the Veteran has established service connection for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease.  See August 2024 rating codesheet.  Records of such reported private treatment have not been sought, may be pertinent to the claim, and must be sought on remand.  Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

Lastly, the September 18, 2024 denial letter was not adequate to apprise the Veteran of the basis of the AOJ decision, to include identification of elements not satisfied in leading to the denial.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).  The denial letter explains that, for payment to be issued, an appointment must be in relation to care or services the Veteran is eligible for; any non-VA appointment must be authorized in advance; and such appointment must be completed unless due to actions other than by the Veteran.  However, the decision does not specify which element(s) the Veteran's claim failed to satisfy, including specifically whether he completed the purported non-VA visit, and if so, whether such was authorized under the Community Care program, as alluded to in prior VA treatment records.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask the Veteran to submit an authorization for VA to secure for the record complete clinical records from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.  If he does so, obtain those records.

2. Take any other steps necessary to determine whether the Veteran completed a non-VA medical appointment at UAMS on September 6, 2024 and to determine whether such appointment was authorized by VA under the Community Care program.  A formal finding memorandum regarding these elements should be associated to the record.    

3. Then, reconsider the claim based on the record.  If it is determined that the Veteran remains ineligible for beneficiary travel benefits for the purported September 6, 2024 appointment at UAMS, notice of this decision should be sent to the Veteran that complies with 38 U.S.C. § 5104.
