REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with emphysema is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1980 until his honorable discharge in August 1980 and from October 2003 until his honorable discharge in January 2005.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Board notes that in August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2023 rating decision.  Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review, the reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  In June 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with emphysema is remanded.

While further delay is regrettable, the Board finds that remand is warranted to correct a pre-decision duty to assist error.  The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2024; however, while pulmonary functioning testing was conducted, the VA examiner did not report maximum oxygen consumption findings.  Accordingly, a remand is necessary to afford the Veteran a new VA examination that adequately addresses the current severity of his service-connected COPD with emphysema. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA respiratory disorders examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of his service-connected COPD with emphysema.  The claims file should be reviewed in conjunction with the examination.  All indicated tests should be conducted and the results reported.

The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating this disability under the appropriate rating criteria, including, but not limited to, the following:

(a.) Findings of pulmonary function testing that measure the percent of the predicted FEV-1, FVC, FEV-1/FVC and DLCO (SB) are required, and maximum oxygen consumption findings should be recorded.

(b.) Findings of cor pulmonale (right heart failure), right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension (shown by Echo or cardiac catheterization), episode(s) of acute respiratory failure, or if the Veteran requires outpatient oxygen therapy.
