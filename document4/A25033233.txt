ORDER

Service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

Service connection for an ulcer on the right foot is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the promulgation of a decision in his appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), the Veteran's representative submitted signed correspondence withdrawing the Veteran's appeal of the denial of service connection for sleep apnea and an ulcer on the right foot.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of service connection for sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for dismissal of service connection for ulcer on the right foot have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1969 through September 1971.  The Veteran deployed to Vietnam, serving as an indirect-fires infantryman (mortarman).  He was awarded the Bronze Star, Vietnam Service Medal, and Combat Infantryman's Badge, among other awards.  

This appeal comes before the Board on the Veteran's appeal of an October 2022 rating decision.  The October 2022 VA rating decision denied service connection for both sleep apnea and an ulcer on the right foot.  The Veteran subsequently filed a January 2023 VA Form 10182: Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing those decisions to the Board.

During the pendency of his appeal, and before the Board rendered a decision in the matter, the Veteran's attorney submitted written correspondence to the Board withdrawing those claims.  See December 2024 Veteran Attorney Correspondence.  The December 2024 correspondence identified the Veteran by name, address, and social security number, and specified that the Veteran wished to withdraw the issues of service connection for sleep apnea and an ulcer on the right foot from the Board's consideration.  The Board finds that Veteran's attorney unequivocally indicated the Veteran's desire to withdraw the appeal of these issues before the Board.    

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify a specific VA decision with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).  Regulation provides for the withdrawal of an appeal when the claimant, or other authorized representative, files a withdrawal request identifying the name of the claimant, the VA file number, and provides a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).  When a pending appeal is withdrawn, there is no longer an allegation of error of fact or law before the Board for appellate consideration.  In such circumstances, dismissal of the appeal is appropriate.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5).  

The Board further notes that the Veteran's attorney requested removal from the Veteran's case in correspondence received in December 2024.  This request was granted, and the attorney has since been removed.

Thus, given the written withdrawal of the appeal, there is no decision that the Veteran disagrees with before the Board, and this appeal is dismissed.
