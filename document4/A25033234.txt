ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for gastroenteritis is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for myopia is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected tinea unguium, fifth digit, right foot, is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected scar, status post Achilles tendon surgery is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for an eye disability, other than myopia, to include bilateral chorioretinal scars, round hole of retina without detachment, lattice retinal degeneration, vitreous degeneration, endothelial corneal dystrophy, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has not been diagnosed with gastroenteritis at any time during or approximate to the appeal period.

2. Refractive errors of the eye, including myopia, are not diseases or injuries for VA disability compensation purposes.

3. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's fifth digit, right foot tinea unguium/onychomycosis manifested in characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected and less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected but did not amount to characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or, at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or, intermittent systemic therapy for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

4. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's left lower extremity scar has been found to be a non-linear scar located at the Achilles tendon region and to be affecting less than 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) of the left lower extremity.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for gastroenteritis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for myopia have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 4.9, 4.127.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected tinea unguium, fifth digit, right foot, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§  4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7813.

4. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected scar, status post Achilles tendon surgery, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Code 7802.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1999 to June 2023.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in July and September 2023 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the September 2023 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) found that the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury or disease onset during the Veteran's service.  Notably, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show treatment for chorioretinal scars after surgery to prevent retinal detachment from retinal lattice of both eyes, treatment for gastroenteritis, and treatment for myopia.  The AOJ further found that the Veteran has current diagnoses of non-infectious gastroenteritis (STRs), myopia, and chorioretinal scars.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  In this case, the April 2023 VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's correct and only diagnosis is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  Thus, the AOJ's favorable finding of a current diagnosis for gastroenteritis has been rebutted by the evidence, and the Board is not bound by the favorable finding.  The Board is bound by the other favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ (entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected scar, status post Achilles tendon surgery) and at the time of the September 2023 (for all other issues noted above) initial rating decisions.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the initial ratings decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated during active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  In general, service connection requires: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

When the evidence is evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether service connection is warranted, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  To deny a claim on its merits, the evidence must persuasively weigh against the claim.  Id.) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

1. Entitlement to service connection for gastroenteritis is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for gastroenteritis which he generally asserts is related to his active service.

Turning to the relevant evidence, service treatment records (STRs) reflect that the Veteran was diagnosed with non-infectious gastroenteritis in January 2013.  

Upon review of evidence of record, the Board finds that during or approximate to the period on appeal, the Veteran has not demonstrated that he has gastroenteritis.  The only mention of gastroenteritis in the evidence of record during the period of appeal is in his February 2023 VA claim for benefits.

In April 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA intestinal conditions examination.  The Veteran reported that his irritable bowel condition started 3 years prior, when he began having intestinal pain with bloated sensation.  He was seen given medication that he could not remember the name of.  The Veteran reporting alternating between constipation and diarrhea.  The Veteran further reported that after eating he feels a burning chest pain and has gastro reflux that happens 3 to 4 times per week.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which he is separately service-connected for.

In August 2023, the AOJ obtained an addendum opinion to clarify whether the Veteran had a diagnosis of gastroenteritis or if it was subsumed with the diagnosed IBS.  The examiner confirmed that gastroenteritis is a general terminology and usually acute in nature and that the Veteran's correct and only diagnosis is IBS.

Proof of a current disability is a threshold to establishing service-connection. In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  

No underlying disability has been clinically diagnosed during the appeal period or proximate thereto.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).

The Veteran is certainly competent to report his history of gastrointestinal symptoms and any treatment that he may have undergone.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  However, during the period on appeal the Veteran has not presented any competent and credible evidence of a current diagnosis of gastroenteritis, and the available evidence does not support that the Veteran has any persistent symptomatology or any complaints that would suggest that he has an underlying disability.

For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim for service connection for gastroenteritis.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable as the evidence is not in approximate balance, and entitlement to service connection for gastroenteritis is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) 

2. Entitlement to service connection for myopia is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for myopia.  VA received the Veteran's initial claim for myopia on February 14, 2023.

VA regulations state that service connection is not generally established for refractive errors of the eye as they are not considered a disease or injury within the meaning of applicable legislation providing compensation benefits.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(c), 4.9, 4.127.  VA defines "refractive errors" as conditions due to anomalies in the shape and conformation of the eye structures, and generally of congenital or developmental origin.  Examples include astigmatism, myopia (nearsighted), hyperopia (farsighted), and presbyopia (due to aging).

In the absence of a superimposed disease or injury, service connection may not be allowed for refractive error of the eye even if visual acuity decreased in service, as it is not a disability within the meaning of applicable legislation relating to service connection.  See id.; see also VAOPGCPREC 82-90 (1990), 55 Fed. Reg. 45,711 (1990).  After a careful review of the record, there is no evidence of any injury or disease during military service that resulted in a superimposed disease or injury resulting in additional vision loss to the eyes.  Significantly, the Veteran has not alleged such suffering from such a superimposed disease or injury.

Myopia is "nearsightedness." Parker v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 522, 523 (1991); Norris v. West, 11 Vet. App. 219, 220 (1998).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his eyes in August 2023.  The examiner noted that myopia is a refractive error and not a ratable diagnosis.

Because refractive error is excluded from the definition of a disease for which service connection may be granted, entitlement to service connection for myopia (refractive error) must be denied as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Because the level of disability may have varied over the course of the claim, the rating may be "staged" higher or lower for segments of time during the period under review in accordance with such variations.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  In initial-rating cases, where the appeal stems from a granted claim of service connection with respect to the initial evaluation assigned, VA assesses the level of disability from the effective date of service connection.  See Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 125; 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Separate disability ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition was not "duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology" of the other condition. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).  However, pyramiding, that is the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when evaluating a Veteran's service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

3. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected tinea unguium, fifth digit, right foot, is denied.

The Veteran generally asserts that his tinea unguium warrants a compensable rating but has not submitted any statements or medical evidence concerning the severity of his symptoms.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that in addition to onychomycosis, the Veteran has been diagnosed with pityriasis versicolor.  Pursuant to the July 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for pityriasis versicolor and awarded an initial 30 percent evaluation.  As the Veteran limited his appeal of the July 2023 rating decision to the issue of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for scar, s/p Achilles tendon surgery, the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for pityriasis versicolor is not on appeal before the Board and the Board will not discuss findings pertaining specifically to that diagnosis.

The Veteran's tinea unguium also known as onychomycosis, is rated noncompensable under Diagnostic Code 7813, for dermatophytosis (tinea unguium (onychomycosis)).  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Effective August 13, 2018, VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities. Generally, the Board may not apply an amended regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  Here, the final rule amending the criteria for rating skin disabilities expressly stated that VA's intent for claims pending prior to August 13, 2018, the effective date of the regulatory change, is for them to be considered under both the pre-amendment and amended rating criteria, and whichever criteria is more favorable to the claimant is to be applied. 83 Fed. Reg. 32593 (July 13, 2018).  The final rule stated that for applications filed on or after August 13, 2018, only the amended criteria can be applied.  Id.

In the present case, VA received the Veteran's initial claim for service connection in February 2023.  Therefore, only the amended criteria may be applied.

Under the amended rating criteria for skin disabilities, a new General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to Diagnostic Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

The General Rating Formula for the Skin provides that a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.

A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.  Id. 

A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  Id. 

A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body, or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period. Or the disability is to be rated as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (Diagnostic Code 7800) or scars (Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating Formula for the Skin.  Id. 

As it pertains to amended Diagnostic Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824, 38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a) explicitly states that "systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin."

Turning to the relevant evidence, the Veteran underwent a VA Skin Diseases Examination in April 2023.  The Veteran had a current diagnosis of tinea unguium (onychomycosis).  The report noted that over the past 12 months, the Veteran's condition had not been treated with medication and that the Veteran had not undergone any treatments or procedures other than systemic or topical medications.  On physical examination, the Veteran had visible characteristic lesions due to his onychomycosis of the fifth toe of the right foot affecting less than 5 percent of his total body area and no exposed area.  The examiner found no related tumors or neoplasms, scarring, or other pertinent physical findings or complications.  There was no functional impact.

Treatment records from the period on appeal are silent as to treatment or complaints related to tinea unguium/onychomycosis.

As noted above, DC 7813 directs the condition to be rated under the criteria of for the General Rating Formula for the Skin or DC 7800, 7801, 7802, 7804, or 7805. Thus, the Board has considered whether a compensable disability rating could be assigned under the General Rating Formula for the Skin, or alternatively, under any of the other listed DCs.

Upon review, the Board finds that the Veteran is appropriately rated noncompensable throughout the entire appeal period under the General Rating Formula for the Skin.  That is, throughout the entire appeal period, his fifth toe, right foot onychomycosis required no more than topical therapy over the past 12-month period and characteristic lesions involved less than 5% total body area and less than 5% exposed area.  Indeed, the Board finds probative the April 2023 VA examination during the period on appeal which reflects that the Veteran's right foot onychomycosis did not require current treatment.  This is consistent with the medical evidence of record lacking any reference to ongoing treatment for onychomycosis during the appeal period.  Moreover, the examiner found that it affected less than 5% total body area and did not affect any exposed area.

The Board has also considered whether any other Diagnostic Code related to disabilities of the skin would provide for a higher disability evaluation.  The evidence, however, does not reflect that the Veteran's symptoms would warrant a higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Regarding all DCs pertaining to scars including DC 7800, 7801, 7802, 7804, and 7805, the Veteran's right foot onychomycosis is not associated with any scarring. To that end, the Board finds probative that the April 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran's skin condition did not cause scarring regardless of location.  This is consistent with and corroborated by the medical evidence of record lacking any mention of scarring due to onychomycosis during the appeal period.  As such, ratings under DC 7800 through 7805 are not warranted.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and entitlement to a compensable disability rating for fifth toe, right foot onychomycosis is not warranted at any time during the appeal period.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

4. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for service-connected scar, status post (s/p) Achilles tendon surgery, is denied.

The Veteran generally asserts that his scar warrants a compensable rating.

The Board notes that VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018.  These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the AOJ on or after August 13, 2018, such as here.  VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection on February 14, 2023.  The AOJ issued the July 2023 rating decision on appeal granting service connection for the Veteran's s/p Achilles tendon surgery scar, and assigned a noncompensable rating, effective July 1, 2023.  The Veteran timely appealed the initial July 2023 rating decision.  Thus, the Board will consider the period on appeal beginning February 10, 2023, the date of the receipt of the Veteran's claim for benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Veteran's left lower extremity scar, which is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, is currently rated noncompensable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

Diagnostic Code 7800 was not changed by the August 13, 2018, amendments. However, Diagnostic Code 7800 pertains to scars or other disfigurement of the head, face, and neck, and is not applicable in this case.

For purposes of evaluation of under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, the eight characteristics of disfigurement are: a scar that is five or more inches, or thirteen centimeters, in length; a scar that is at least one-quarter of an inch, or 0.6 centimeters, wide at the widest part; surface contour of the scar that is elevated or depressed on palpation; a scar that is adherent to underlying tissue; skin that is hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches, or 39 square centimeters; skin texture that is abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding six square inches, or 39 square centimeters; underlying soft tissue that is missing in an area exceeding six square inches, or 39 square centimeters; and skin that is indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches, or 39 square centimeters.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800, Note 1.

VA is to consider unretouched color photographs when evaluating under these criteria.  Id. at Note 3.

Additionally, VA is to separately evaluate disabling effects other than disfigurement that are associated with individual scars of the head, face, or neck, such as pain, instability, and residuals of associated muscle or nerve injury, under the appropriate diagnostic code(s) and apply 38 C.F.R. § 4.25 to combine the evaluation(s) with the evaluation assigned under Diagnostic Code 7800.  Id. at Note 4.

Finally, the characteristics of disfigurement may be caused by one scar or by multiple scars; the characteristics that are required to assign a particular evaluation need not be caused by a single scar in order to assign that evaluation.  Id. at Note 5.

Since August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7801 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  As the Veteran's scar has not been shown to be associated with underlying soft tissue damage, DC 7801 is not for application.

Since August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  DC 7802 was otherwise unchanged by the August 13, 2018, amendments.  Under DC 7802, which provides for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, a scar with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater warrants a 10 percent rating.

Diagnostic Code 7804 was not changed by the August 13, 2018, amendments. Under DC 7804, one or two scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 10 percent rating. Three or four scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 20 percent rating. Five or more scars that are unstable or painful warrants a 30 percent rating.  Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7804 instructs that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.

Diagnostic Code 7805 was not changed by the August 13, 2018, amendments.  DC 7805 provides that any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800 to 7804 are to be evaluated under an appropriate diagnostic code.

Turning to the relevant evidence, In the May 2023 VA examination report, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran has a left lower extremity scar.  The Veteran reported that his scar is the result of a 2017 Achilles tendon surgery and has remained stable.  The examiner measured the Veteran's left lower extremity scar with a length and width of 5 by 2 centimeters (cm).  The examiner determined that the approximate total area of the scar is 10 cm squared.  On examination, the Veteran's scar was not found be painful or unstable.  The examiner determined that the Veteran's scar does not result in limitation of function.

Based on the above, a compensable rating under DC 7802 for the Veteran's left lower extremity scar is not established.  To this end, the record demonstrates, one nonlinear scar located on the Veteran's left lower extremity.  However, his lower extremity scar does not span an area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm.) or an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  Instead, the combined area of the Veteran's left lower extremity scar is measured at 10 sq. cm.

Moreover, as there is no evidence the Veteran's scar is painful or unstable, a compensable rating under DC 7804 is not for application.  Lastly, DC 7805 is not for application because the Veteran's service-connected scar has not been shown to impact functionality.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether a compensable disability rating for the Veteran's left lower extremity scar is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding in favor of the Veteran's increased rating claim.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), is therefore not for application as to these claims.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Unfortunately, the remaining issue must be remanded to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error that occurred prior to the September 2023 rating decision on appeal.

Entitlement to service connection for an eye disability other than myopia, to include bilateral chorioretinal scars, round hole of retina without detachment, lattice retinal degeneration, vitreous degeneration, endothelial corneal dystrophy, is remanded.

As an initial matter, while the Veteran's claim was for chorioretinal scars, he has been diagnosed with a number of eye conditions during the period on appeal.  See August 2023 Eye Conditions VA Examination.  As such, the Veteran's claim has been expanded to include all diagnosed eye disabilities, other than myopia (which is separately adjudicated above). See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

The Veteran was afforded a VA eye examination in August 2023.  The AOJ obtained an opinion the same month.  However, the AOJ instructed the examiner to opine whether the Veteran's diagnosed eye conditions which clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service, were aggravated beyond natural progression by surgery for detachment during service.  The examiner proceeded to offer a negative opinion.

The Board notes that the Veteran's enlistment examination and report of medical history are both normal as to the eyes.  See January 1999 Enlistment Examination and Report of Medical History

The AOJ's failure to obtain a VA opinion using the correct legal standard for entitlement to service connection on a direct basis constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error that requires remand.

Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion from an appropriately qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's eye condition, other than myopia, diagnosed as bilateral chorioretinal scars, round hole of retina without detachment, lattice retinal degeneration, vitreous degeneration, endothelial corneal dystrophy.
