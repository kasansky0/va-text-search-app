ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a somatic symptom disorder disability is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, to include as due to herbicide agent exposure, is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a right foot disability, to include arthritis, calluses and hallus valgus (claimed as toe deformities), as secondary to service connected flat feet with plantar fasciitis, is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability, to include arthritis, calluses and hallus valgus (claimed as toe deformities), as secondary to service connected flat feet with plantar fasciitis, is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee arthritis is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee arthritis is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has not had a diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim; the probative evidence also shows that the Veteran is not functionally impacted by any reported symptoms that could be attributed to such.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a somatic symptom disorder disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force from December 1975 to August 1979.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, also known as the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In October 8, 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) forms, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2021 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, for the remanded claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Regarding the Veteran's bilateral foot disabilities, the Veteran submitted an August 2021 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0095) forms, constituting continuous pursuit of his disability. A September 2021 rating decision was issued denying the claim. Despite the August 2021 Supplemental claims having been submitted and processed, the Board will construe the October 2021 Form 10182 liberally to include the bilateral foot issues. See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 3 (2023) (holding that a claimant may file more than one administrative review in response to an AOJ decision, provided that the requests are filed within one year of the AOJ decision and that the review requests are not pending concurrently). 

Service connection

In general, service connection may be established for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection requires evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material favorable to the claimant. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990). Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).

The Board must also fully consider the lay assertions of record. Competent lay evidence is any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed by a lay person, to include observable symptoms. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Further, a lay witness may opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology, provided that such matters are amenable to a lay person's observation. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative balance, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001). If the evidence persuasively weighs against a claim, the claim is denied.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a somatic symptom disorder disability. 

The Veteran claims he has a somatic symptom disorder disability. See December 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ; October 2021 VA Form 10182. 

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes the Veteran has not had a diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran's service treatment records contain documentation of treatment for a diagnosis of bilateral pes planus with foot pain but do not contain any documentation of somatic symptoms or diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder, complaints or treatment for any other disabilities or symptoms in service. See June 1975 enlistment and June 1979 separation examinations. As discussed above, the Veteran has been granted service connection for a bilateral foot disability, including pes planus. January 2025 Code Sheet. 

Post-service treatment records do not contain documentation of a diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder disability or evidence of somatic issues. 

In March 2021 and September 2021 VA examinations conducted after the Veteran's December 2020 VA claim, the examiners found that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of somatic syndrome disorder and diagnosed the Veteran with major depressive disorder with unspecified anxiety disorder. The Board finds the March and September 2021 VA examinations to be highly probative, as they were written by a clinicians who possess the necessary education, training, or experience to provide competent medical evidence under 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1). See Cox v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 563 (2007). Additionally, they are based on review of the record and a thorough examination of the Veteran.

The Board has considered the Veteran's assertion that he has a somatic symptom disorder disability. He is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), as to the specific issue in this case, a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n. 4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay persons not competent to diagnose cancer); Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462.

To the extent the Veteran is asserting that he has somatic symptoms related to his lumbar spine, sciatic nerve and pes planus and flat fee with plantar fasciitis disabilities, he has been service connected for lumbosacral strain, degenerative arthritis, intervertebral disc disease (IVDS), sciatic nerve and pes planus and flat fee with plantar fasciitis disabilities and compensated for symptoms associated with these disabilities. 

Proof of a current disability is a threshold to establishing service-connection for any claimed disability. In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). To be a present as a current disability, there must be evidence of the condition at some time during the appeal period. Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Here, there is no diagnosis of a current disability found in the record. Thus, the Veteran's claim does not meet the first prong of service connection, the requirement of a current disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

In sum, the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim. See Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. Accordingly, service connection for a somatic syndrome disorder disability must be denied. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, to include as due to herbicide agent exposure.

The Veteran contends that his diabetes mellitus disability is related to service, including herbicide agent exposure. See November 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ.

A remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. The AOJ failed to develop for TERA, other than herbicide agents and failed to obtain a VA examination. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006).

In this case, the Veteran asserted that his disability is related to service, including as a result of exposure to Agent Orange while working on C-130s and C17s aircraft used to spray Agent Orange in Vietnam. See August 2020 Statement. In a June 2024 Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum, the AOJ found that Veteran did not qualify for a presumption of exposure(s) for one or more of the following hazards during military service: herbicide agents, radiation, mustard gas, or Camp Lejeune Water contamination. However, the record does not contain evidence of development regarding other toxic exposure related to working on C-130s and C17s aircraft. 

Further, a VA examination is required if the information and evidence of record does not contain sufficient competent medical evidence to decide the claim, but (1) contains competent evidence of a diagnosed disability or symptoms of disability, (2) establishes that the Veteran suffered an event, injury or disease in service, or has a presumptive disease during the pertinent presumptive period, and (3)indicates that the claimed disability may be associated with the in-service event, injury, or disease, or with another service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006). The threshold for finding a link between a current disability and service so as to require medical examination is low. Locklear v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 410 (2006). Here, the Veteran has a current disability and the record shows that the disability may be related to service. February 2020 VA treatment records show a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the Veteran has asserted that his disability is related to service, including as a result of exposure to Agent Orange while working on C-130s and C17s aircraft used to spray Agent Orange in Vietnam. See August 2020 Statement. The threshold for providing an examination is low, and without an examination and opinion the record contains insufficient evidence to adjudicate the case. Accordingly, a VA examination and opinion should be provided.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability

4. Entitlement to service connection for a right foot disability.

5. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability. 

6. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability.

The Veteran contends that his bilateral foot and knee disabilities are related to service. See January 2018 and December 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ; October 2021 VA Form 10182.  

A remand is necessary to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. The AOJ failed to obtain relevant private treatment records, and the November 2018 and May 2021 VA medical examinations are inadequate. See VA. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c)(1); See Ivey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 320, 323 (1992); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

In the November 2020 private podiatry treatment records from Dr. J.P., DPM, the physician notes that the Veteran was a prior patient of Dr. K. However, the claims file does not contain any records from Dr. K or evidence of attempts to obtain such records. Further, the November 2015 VA treatment records contain a referral to Dr. J. C. for right ankle and foot pain with a notation that the Veteran was required to re-enroll in VHA Choice before the consult could be completed. The claims file does not contain any records from Dr. J. C. or evidence of attempts to obtain such records. Further, February 2018 VA treatment notes show Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the knee was ordered with a consult for surgery. Although the claims file contains May 2018 MRI results, the claims file does not contain any records from regarding the surgery consult or evidence of attempts to obtain such records. 

With respect to his bilateral foot disabilities, the record contains conflicting evidence regarding the onset of the Veteran's disability generally and continuity of symptomology of his arthritis disability. In the January 2016 VA podiatry records, the Veteran states his right foot pain began six months prior. In February 2016 VA physical therapy records, he stated that his bilateral foot pain bean approximately nine months ago with insidious onset. He also stated that he had not had any pain in his feet before, but he had always had flat feet. However, during the November 2018 VA Examination, he reported having had pain in his feet since service. Therefore, remand is necessary to reconcile the conflicting evidence about the onset of the Veteran's bilateral foot arthritis. 

Additionally, the November 2018 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's sinus tarsi syndrome was a progression of his service connected bilateral pes planus. However, it is not clear if the disability still existed at the time of the Veteran's December 2020 claim for foot pain. See VA Form 21-526EZ. A remand is required for an examiner to determine whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of sinus tarsi syndrome. 

Further, the May 2021 VA examiner provided secondary service connection opinions for hallus valgus and calluses but failed to provide secondary service connection opinions regarding aggravation for the Veteran's right and left foot disabilities other than pes planus and plantar fascitis. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013). 

Regarding the Veteran's bilateral knee disabilities, the May 2021 VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion regarding bilateral knee arthritis but failed to address the Veteran's other diagnoses of record, including chondromalacia, partial-thickness tear to correlate with symptoms of prepatellar bursitis and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ganglion. See May 2018 MRI Results; McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007) (holding that the requirement of a current disability is met when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim). Further, the May 2021 VA examiner noted knee arthritis, but the examiner's opinion only addresses a diagnosis of chondromalacia. In this case, the record does not contain imaging of the Veteran's knees that shows knee arthritis as indicated in the May 2021 VA Examination. An arthritis diagnosis must be objectively confirmed by x-ray. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. A medical opinion is inadequate if it offers a contradictory analysis of the Veteran's disability and nexus to service. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007). Finally, the record does not contain service connection opinions regarding arthritis if it exists, an aggravation opinion regarding the Veteran's chondromalacia, or service connection opinions for the Veteran's diagnosed partial thickness tear to correlate with symptoms of prepatellar bursitis and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ganglion. 

On remand, the AOJ should make reasonable efforts to obtain the missing private treatment records and obtain adequate service connection opinions for the Veteran's bilateral foot and knee disabilities. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Make reasonable efforts to obtain:

(a.) private podiatry treatment records from Dr. K, noted in the November 2020 podiatry treatment notes of J.P., DPM.

(b.) a referral to Dr. J. C. for right ankle and foot pain noted in the November 2015 VA treatment records.

2. Develop for TERA exposure, including any chemicals that may be related to working on C-130s and C17s aircraft.  

3. After #2, has been completed, schedule a VA examination for the Veteran's diabetes mellitus disability. The examiner should review the claims file, including a copy of this remand, and answer the following:

Opine whether it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the disability (1) began during active service, or (2) is otherwise related to a disease or injury during a period of active service, to include claimed herbicide agent exposure?

The examiner should consider (1) total potential toxic exposure through all applicable military deployments; and (2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities.

Provide a detailed rationale and complete medical explanation to support the opinions.  

In providing the requested opinion, consider the Veteran's description of his in-service injury and symptoms as well as his post-service symptoms. If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported injury and symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of his current disability, this should be noted. Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about his symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?

4. After #1 has been completed, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for his bilateral foot disability. The examiner should review the claims file, including a copy of this remand, and answer the following:

(a)	Clarify the nature of the Veteran's current disability. Provide a medical explanation. Of note, the record contains diagnoses of sinus tarsi syndrome, arthritis, bilateral calluses, and hallux valgus. The examiner should address the Veteran's diagnosis of sinus tarsi syndrome found in the November 2018 VA Examination and whether such a diagnosis existed at the time of the Veteran's December 2020 foot pain claim. 

For each disability:

(b)	Opine whether it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the disability (1) began during active service, or (2) is otherwise related to a disease or injury during a period of active service?

(c)	Opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the disability is caused by service-connected disability (i.e., the disability would not have developed but for the service-connected disability), or functionally worsened by the service-connected disability, to include by an inability to treat it?

The examiner should consider the Veterans' statement in the January 2016 VA podiatry records that his right foot pain began six months prior; his statement in the February 2016 VA physical therapy records that his that his bilateral foot pain began approximately nine months ago with insidious onset, that he had not had any pain in his feet before and he had always had flat feet; and his statement during the November 2018 VA Examination that he has experienced pain in his feet since service. The examiner also should reconcile the conflicting evidence regarding the onset of each bilateral foot disability found and continuity of symptomology of the Veteran's bilateral arthritis disability.

Provide a complete rationale and detailed medical explanation to support the opinions. If speculation would be required, please explain why.

In providing the requested opinion, consider the Veteran's description of his in-service injury and symptoms as well as his post-service symptoms. If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported injury and symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of his current disability, this should be noted. Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about his symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?

5. After #1 has been completed, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for his bilateral knee disability. The examiner should review the claims file, including a copy of this remand, and answer the following:

(a)	Clarify the nature of the Veteran's current disability. Provide a medical explanation. Of note, the record contains diagnoses of chondromalacia, partial-thickness tear to correlate with symptoms of prepatellar bursitis and ACL ganglion. However, the record does not contain a diagnosis of knee arthritis confirmed by imaging. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. The examiner should order all appropriate diagnostic tests pertaining to the Veteran's claim.  

For each disability found:

(b)	Opine whether it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the disability (1) began during active service, or (2) is otherwise related to a disease or injury during a period of active service?

(c)	Opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the disability is caused by service-connected disability (i.e., the disability would not have developed but for the service-connected disability), or functionally worsened by the service-connected disability, to include by an inability to treat it?

The examiner should consider the Veteran's statement in the February 2018 VA treatment records that he had chronic knee and ankle pain "present for some time."

Provide a complete rationale and detailed medical explanation to support the opinions. If speculation would be required, please explain why.

In providing the requested opinion, consider the Veteran's description of his in-service injury and symptoms as well as his post-service symptoms. If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported injury and symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of his current disability, this should be noted. Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about his symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
