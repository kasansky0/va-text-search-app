4. The Veteran's ischemic heart disease first arose on July 17, 2023.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The Veteran did not pursue continuously his April 2019 claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a) (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) (2024).

2. The criteria for an effective date of July 17, 2023, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for coronary artery disease (CAD) are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5108, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114, 3.400, 3.2500.

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1966 to June 1969. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on an appeal from a September 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the AOJ.

The Veteran filed a November 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, and elected the Direct Review docket. As the appellant has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issues on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. The appellant is welcome to file a supplemental claim to have this evidence considered. Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

The Board acknowledges that the period to change AMA dockets per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not elapsed. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 311 (2024). On January 21, 2025, the Board sent a letter to the Veteran advising him that he had the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new and timely VA Form 10182 in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2), and that the Board was unable to adjudicate his appeal until the time period ended or he submitted a signed waiver of his right to request a different Board review option. On January 21, 2025, the Veteran, through counsel, submitted a waiver of time and requested the Board review his appeal as soon as possible. See January 2025 Third Party Correspondence. Therefore, as the Veteran submitted a waiver, the Board finds it may now adjudicate the appeal. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

1. Entitlement to an effective date of July 17, 2023, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for CAD.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to August 25, 2023, for the award of service connection for coronary artery disease (claimed as ischemic heart disease). 

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date for an award of service connection is the day after separation from service or day entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). The effective date will generally date back to the date of an earlier claim if that claim was still pending on the date of the award. See Williams v. Peake, 521 F.3d 1348, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Where there is a prior final disallowance, the effective date will be the later of the date of the new claim or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r). 

The Veteran's original claim for entitlement to service connection for ischemic heart disease was originally denied in an October 2019 rating decision. He and his then-representative were notified of the decision in October 2019 and given notice of his procedural and appellate rights. Notably, the April 2019 claim was for service connection for both ischemic heart disease and hypertension, both of which were denied in the October 2019 rating decision. 

The Veteran filed a July 2020 supplemental claim but only as to hypertension, listing the October 2019 rating as the one he sought to challenge. As the Veteran was well aware of the denial of service connection for ischemic heart disease in October 2019, the Board cannot find that the July 2020 filing was a supplemental claim as to the ischemic heart disease claim. The Veteran also filed a July 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, which added new claims for Service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus. When the hypertension claim was denied in August 2020, the Veteran filed another supplemental claim in August 2020 as to hypertension. After that claim was granted in November 2020, the Veteran did not file any claims until December 2022. 

On December 14, 2022, the Veteran filed an Intent to File on VA Form 21-0966, and in August 2023, he filed a supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection for ischemic heart disease. No claims were filed between the December 2022 Intent to File and the August 2023 supplemental claim. On his supplemental claim form, the Veteran stated he had new and relevant evidence as his October 2019 denial for service connection for ischemic heart disease was based upon his then diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease and congestive heart failure. Id. 

In a December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been presented and the claim was reconsidered. The previous denial of service connection for ischemic heart disease was confirmed. 

On May 31, 2024, the Veteran filed a request for a HLR on VA Form 20-0996, regarding the AOJ's denial of service connection for ischemic heart disease. In a September 2024 HLR decision, the AOJ found that the December 2023 decision to deny service connection for coronary artery disease (claimed as ischemic heart disease) was clearly and unmistakably erroneous as the Veteran was confirmed to have been exposed to herbicide agents during service and CAD was a condition entitled to presumptive service connection. The AOJ granted service connection for CAD, effective August 25, 2023, the date the Veteran filed his supplemental claim. The Veteran then filed a November 2024 Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement appealing the effective date of the award of service connection for CAD.  

As stated above, when there is a prior final disallowance of a claim, the effective date will be the later of the date of the new claim or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r). Prior to filing the August 2023 supplemental claim, the Veteran filed an intent to file claim on December 14, 2022. As the ensuing August 2023 supplemental claim was timely, and the Board acknowledges that December 14, 2022, the date VA received his intent to file, was the date of his new claim for service connection for CAD. However, prior to assigning an effective date, the Board must consider the date entitlement arose. Id. 

The Board finds the evidence of record fails to support that the Veteran was diagnosed with coronary artery disease prior to July 17, 2023. During an October 2019 VA examination, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with hypertensive heart disease and congestive heart failure. The examiner stated that the Veteran's diagnosed conditions did not qualify within the generally accepted medical definition of ischemic heart disease. The Veteran's VA medical records were consistent with this finding as records in March 2020 and April 2023 indicate diagnosis and treatment for hypertension, but do not contain evidence of a diagnosis of CAD. See September and October 2023 VA Medical Treatment Records. The Veteran does not identify such evidence of ischemic heart disease prior to July 17, 2023, in his brief. November 20, 2024, Correspondence.

On July 17, 2023, the Veteran underwent an echocardiogram that indicated mitral valve thickened with nodular degeneration, mild mitral regurgitation, moderate mitral annular calcification, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and mild (physiologic) pulmonic regurgitation. See October 2023 Private Medical Treatment Records. 

During a December 2023 VA Examination, the Veteran reported that in July 2023 he started experiencing an increase in symptoms. The examiner noted the Veteran's medical records indicated that in July 2023, a blockage of the left circumflex was identified. He underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) that same month and noticed an improvement in his symptoms. The examiner confirmed the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, status post stenting, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and atrial fibrillation. Id. 

Therefore, the Board finds an effective date of July 17, 2023, the date he was diagnosed with CAD and the date entitlement arose, for the award of service connection for CAD is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2), (r). 

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran believes he is entitled to an effective date of April 2019 for his award of service connection for CAD, the Board concludes that his argument fails based on multiple points. 

First, the Veteran argues that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for service connection for CAD as it was caused by his service-connected hypertension, and therefore, the effective date should relate back to the date he was awarded service connection for hypertension, specifically August 23, 2019. However, the Veteran was not awarded service connection for CAD (claimed as ischemic heart disease) secondary to his service-connected hypertension, instead the claim for CAD was granted by presumption as a separate claim. See Locklear v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 311 (2011) (bifurcation of a claim generally is within VA's discretion). As the claim for CAD was granted presumptively based on the Veteran's presumed exposure to herbicide agents, he was not required to provide a nexus opinion regarding whether his CAD was caused by, or a result of, his service-connected hypertension as would be required for an award of secondary service connection. 

Second, even if the Veteran were to provide a nexus opinion for secondary service connection, and if the claim was granted on that basis, he still would not be entitled to an earlier effective date based on secondary service connection. Awards of secondary service connection are not awards of increased compensation within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. § 5110, and therefore the effective date cannot be earlier than the date of the claim for service connection on a secondary basis. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has repeatedly rejected the argument that a disability service connected as secondary to an underlying service-connected disability be entitled to the effective date of the underlying disability. See Manzanares v. Shulkin, 863 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2017); Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d at 1364. See also Ross v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 528 (2008). Here, the Veteran's initial claim for service connection for ischemic heart disease was denied in an October 2019 rating decision that he did not appeal. His supplemental claim for service connection for ischemic heart disease was not filed until August 2023. 

Third and most importantly, the evidence of record fails to support that the Veteran was diagnosed with coronary artery disease prior to July 2023. As stated above, the October 2019 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with hypertensive heart disease and congestive heart failure and stated his diagnosed conditions were not ischemic heart disease. His VA medical records were consistent with this finding, and the December 2023 VA examiner explained the Veteran reported an increase in symptoms in July 2023 and was diagnosed with CAD that some month.  See October 2019 and December 2023 VA Examinations, September and October 2023 VA Medical Treatment Records, October 2023 Private Medical Treatment Records.

The Board concludes that the Veteran would not be entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for coronary artery disease based on the theory of secondary service connection. Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran meets the requirements for entitlement to an effective date of July 17, 2023, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for coronary artery disease and the claim is granted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).
