ORDER

The appeal for service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 14, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received correspondence from the appellant that he wished to withdraw his appeal as to service connection for GERD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the September 2, 2021, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) as to the claim for service connection for GERD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from August 2001 to December 2001 and February 2003 to May 2004.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2021 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision, which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the August 2021 rating decision, the RO denied an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for GERD.

On September 2, 2021, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  The Veteran selected the Hearing docket.  A hearing was scheduled for April 2, 2025.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative, and must include the name of the Veteran, the VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Id. 

In the present case, in a March 14, 2025, email correspondence, the Veteran indicated that he wished to withdraw the appeal of the above issue and provided the docket number listed above.  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
