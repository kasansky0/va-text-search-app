REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU), on an extraschedular basis, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran was on active duty from July 23, 1981, until October 15, 1981, and served in the reserves for approximately 22 years thereafter. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which continued a 40 percent evaluation for a lumbar condition. In August 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) because the May 2024 rating decision did not address extraschedular TDIU. 

The January 2023 rating decision granted the Veteran service connection for his lumbar condition with a 40 percent evaluation. In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) requesting TDIU. The May 2024 HLR rating decision did not address the Veteran's request for TDIU or his assertion that it should have been considered without a separate claim. In August 2024, in response to the May 2024 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a NOD and selected the direct review docket.  

The evidentiary record in a HLR is limited to the evidence considered in the prior AOJ decision under review; the higher-level adjudicator may not consider additional evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601 (f). Thus, in reviewing a HLR decision, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying rating decision for which the appellant requested HLR (as that is the evidence that the AOJ was permitted to consider in the HLR decision on appeal), as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran during an evidentiary window. In this case, as the May 2024 rating decision on appeal constitutes a HLR rating decision, the Board's current review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's January 2023 rating decision. Additionally, as the Veteran elected the direct review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The denial of due process may include issuing a Board decision prior to the expiration of the one-year period for a claimant to request a docket change. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, the Board is not rendering a decision on the merits but remanding the case. Accordingly, the Veteran's due process rights are not adversely affected by not waiting until May 14, 2025, the end of the period in which to request a docket change.  

Entitlement to TDIU on an extraschedular basis, is remanded.

It is the established policy of VA that all Veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training and previous work experience, but not the Veteran's age or to any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

A total disability rating for compensation may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more.  If there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and the combined rating must be 70 percent or more.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). For consideration under these provisions, disabilities resulting from common etiology, or a single accident will be evaluated as one disability.  Id. 

In exceptional cases, a TDIU may still be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when a Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b), 4.16 (a).

However, The Board may not award TDIU on an extraschedular basis in the first instance. Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 10 (2001). First there must be a determination whether there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran is unemployable due solely to the service-connected disabilities.  Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021).  If so, the issue of extraschedular TDIU will then be referred to the Director of Compensation service (Director) for a determination on whether an extraschedular TDIU is warranted.    

The ultimate question of whether a Veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is not a medical one; that determination is for the adjudicator.  Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Floore v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 376, 381 (2013).  As such, the focus of the examiner is not on whether the Veteran is unemployable due to service-connected disabilities, but the functional impairment caused solely by those service-connected disabilities.

In this case, the Veteran was service connected for his lumbar spine condition at 40 percent with no other service-connected disabilities in January 2023. The Veteran submitted an HLR request in January 2024 requesting TDIU consideration. As the Veteran was not service-connected for a single disability with a rating of at least 60 percent, he did not meet the schedular rating criteria for TDIU. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  

As the Board discussed above, the lack of schedular eligibility does not preclude a Veteran from receiving a TDIU.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  He may still receive a TDIU on an extraschedular basis.  Id.  The AOJ must determine whether there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran is unemployable due solely to the service-connected lumbar spine disability.  Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021).  

Accordingly, a remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. The extraschedular TDIU issue is remanded to obtain an adequate occupational individual unemployability assessment to directly address whether the Veteran is capable of substantial and gainful employment considering his service-connected lumbar spine disability. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ is requested to schedule the Veteran for an occupational assessment to evaluate whether the Veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment considering his single service-connected lumbar spine disability.

2.  The evaluator's opinion and the AOJ's decision must be based on the record as a whole, which includes the occupational assessment, the Veteran's testimony during the January 2019 Hearing, the Social Security Disability records in the record, the Veteran's private and VA medical records, and the Compensation and Pension Disability examinations which address his functional and work limitations and work history.

3. If the AOJ determines there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran is unemployable due solely to his service-connected lumbar spine disability, the AOJ is requested to refer the issue of extraschedular TDIU to the Director for a determination on whether extraschedular TDIU is warranted.
