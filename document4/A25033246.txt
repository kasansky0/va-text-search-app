ORDER

An effective date of September 23, 2023, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

A compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss for the period between September 23, 2023, and December 14, 2023, is denied.

A compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss since March 7, 2024, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In October 2017, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  The Veteran did not perfect an appeal of the decision to the Board and the October 2017 rating decision became final.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, bilateral hearing loss was first noted as early as February 1, 2000, his Intent to File was received on September 23, 2023, and there are no documents or communications prior to that date that constitute a formal or informal claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

3. For the period on appeal between September 23, 2023, and December 14, 2023, audiometric testing revealed, at worst, an average puretone threshold of 34 decibels (dBs) and 94 percent speech recognition in the right ear and an average puretone threshold of 36 dBs and 90 percent speech recognition in the left ear.

4. For the period on appeal since March 7, 2024, audiometric testing revealed, at worst, an average puretone threshold of 31 dBs and 100 percent speech recognition in the right ear and an average puretone threshold of 31 dBs and 100 percent speech recognition in the left ear.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The October 2017 rating decision is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103 (2024).

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for an effective date of September 23, 2023, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 20.202, 20.301, 3.155, 3.157, 3.400 (2024).  

3. The criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss for the period between September 23, 2023, and December 14, 2023, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 20.202, 20.301, 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6100 (2024).

4. The criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss for the period since March 7, 2024, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 20.202, 20.301, 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, DC 6100 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Navy from January 1980 to January 1984 and from March 1984 to March 2000.  His claim stems from a December 2023 rating decision which granted a previously denied claim of service connection for hearing loss and assigned a noncompensable rating, effective as of October 16, 2023.  

Subsequently in March 2024, the Veteran filed a new claim asserting entitlement to a compensable rating for his bilateral hearing loss.  However, later that month, the AOJ continued the previously assigned noncompensable rating.  He subsequently submitted a request for a Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the March 2024 rating decision in accordance with the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), challenging the rating assigned for his bilateral hearing loss.  However, in a July 2024 HLR rating decision, a Decision Review Officer (DRO) again continued the noncompensable rating assigned for his bilateral hearing loss.

In August 2024, the Veteran appealed to the Board via a Form 10182.  In so doing, he challenged the rating and effective date assigned by the AOJ for his service-connected hearing loss in its December 2023 and March 2024 rating decisions.  He requested that his claims be considered on the Direct Review Docket; therefore, the claims will be considered on the basis of the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 and March 2024 rating decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.301.

Notably, in his August 2024 Form 10182, the Veteran also appealed an October 2017 rating decision in which the AOJ initially denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss, and indicated that his appeals of the December 2023 and March 2024 rating decisions included appeals for "service connection."  However, as discussed above, the AOJ granted service connection for the disorder in the December 2023 rating decision currently on appeal.  Therefore, the Board will not further address the issue, as the benefit sought has already been granted.  

Earlier Effective Date

Turning to the relevant laws and regulations, unless specifically provided otherwise in the statute, the effective date of an award based on an original claim for compensation benefits shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 48 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

The effective date of an award for disability compensation shall be the date following separation from service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation; otherwise, the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  

Under the laws currently in effect, a claim must be filed on the form provided by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  

However, prior to March 24, 2015, a "claim" included formal and informal communications in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2010).  Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA could have constituted an informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2010).  The essential elements were: (1) an intent to apply for the benefits; (2) an identification of the benefits sought; and (3) a communication in writing.  Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2010) (noting that an informal claim must identify the benefit sought).  

Finally, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that once a decision has become final, a claimant may not properly file and VA has no authority to adjudicate a freestanding earlier effective date claim in an attempt to overcome the finality of a decision.  Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).  The Court reasoned that such claims would vitiate the rule of finality.  However, decisions are subject to revision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  If evidence establishes the error, the prior decision shall be reversed or revised.  38 U.S.C. § 7111.  

The Veteran contends that an effective date prior to October 16, 2023, is warranted for his bilateral hearing loss.  In the December 2023 and March 2024 rating decisions on appeal, the AOJ assigned and affirmed an effective date of October 16, 2023- the date of receipt of an intent to file a claim for compensation- for the claim on appeal.  Accordingly, the question is whether an earlier effective date is warranted.

Turning first to an effective date based on the day following separation from service, the Veteran separated from active service in March 2000 and did not submit his claim until years later.  As such, he is not entitled to an effective date within one year of discharge from service.

As to the date entitlement arose for his bilateral hearing loss, the Veteran reported in an October 2023 Supplemental Claim and December 2023 VA examination, that he served as a machinist mate in the engine room of a Naval vessel.  He indicated that he was exposed to excessive noise from engine rooms, generators, air compressors, and weapons trainings.  

A review of his service treatment records (STRs) includes an August 1983 STR affirming that the Veteran worked in engine rooms.  Subsequently, multiple STRs throughout his periods of active service indicate that his hearing underwent significant threshold shifts.  Notably, an August 1997 STR suggested that the threshold shift was attributable to noise-related hearing loss, and a November 1999 STR documented that the Veteran was routinely noise-exposed.  Ultimately, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, February 1, 2000- the day after his separation from active service- is the date entitlement arose.  

As to the date of claim, the record shows that a claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss was first received on February 8, 2017.  The AOJ denied the Veteran's claim in an October 2017 rating decision.  He timely submitted a Notice of Disagreement reasserting his entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

In August 2018, the AOJ issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) again denying service connection for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss; however, he did not perfect his appeal to the Board.  Therefore, the October 2017 rating decision became final and cannot support an earlier effective date for his service-connected bilateral hearing loss.

Next, the record shows that the Veteran submitted an Intent to File a claim for compensation on September 23, 2023, and filed a new claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss on the same date via a VA Form 21-526EZ.  In an October 3, 2023, letter, VA indicated that the Veteran had filed the claim on an improper form.  However, it notified him that if he submitted his claim on the appropriate form within a year of the date of receipt of his Intent to File, he could be entitled to compensation from the date of the September 2023 Intent to File.  

Next, he submitted a second Intent to File a claim for compensation on October 16, 2023.  Subsequently on October 31, 2023, he submitted a Supplemental Claim reasserting entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  In December 2023, the AOJ granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss and assigned an effective date of October 16, 2023- the date on which VA received the Veteran's second Intent to File.  

Under the relevant laws and regulations, veterans may indicate their desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  If VA receives a complete claim on the proper form prescribed by the Secretary within 1 year of its receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file was received.  Id.  

Importantly, VA will not recognize more than one intent to file concurrently for the same benefit (e.g. compensation, pension).  If an intent to file has not been followed by a complete claim, a subsequent intent to file regarding the same benefit received within 1 year of the prior intent to file will have no effect.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6).  

Here, the Veteran submitted Intent to File forms indicating his desire to file a claim for compensation on September 23, 2023, and October 16, 2023.  While he submitted a September 23, 2023, claim for bilateral hearing loss on an improper form, he timely corrected his error when he submitted his October 31, 2023, Supplemental Claim.  As he corrected his error within a year of receipt of the September 2023 Intent to File, the October 16, 2023, Intent to File has no effect and the Veteran's October 31, 2023, claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss corresponds with his initial Intent to File.  Accordingly, September 23, 2023- the date of receipt of the initial Intent to File form- is the date of claim of the appeal.

Effective dates are assigned based on the date of claim (September 23, 2023) or the date entitlement arose (February 1, 2000), whichever is later.  For that reason, the Board finds that the later of the two dates is September 23, 2023, service connection is warranted as of that date, and the appeal is granted to this extent.  

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  

In addition, the Rating Schedule provides rating tables for the evaluation of hearing impairments.  Table VI assigns a Roman numeral designation (I through XI) for hearing impairment based on a combination of percent speech discrimination and the puretone threshold average (the sum of puretone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz (Hz), divided by four).  38 C.F.R. § 4.5.  Table VII is used to determine the percentage evaluation by combining the Table VI Roman numeral designations for hearing impairment in each ear.

When evaluating service-connected hearing impairment, ratings are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned in audiometric evaluations.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

38 C.F.R. § 4.86 provides for exceptional patterns of hearing impairment.  When the puretone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz) is 55 dBs or more, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  Each ear is evaluated separately.  

Finally, under the AMA, veterans may continuously pursue a claim or issue by timely and properly filing either: (a) a supplemental claim; (b) a request for higher-level review; (c) an appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals; or (d) a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  Where a claim is continuously pursued, the claim will be considered filed as of the date of the initial claim in the chain rather than the date on which the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c).  

However, an initial increased rating claim submitted on a VA Form 21-526EZ does not demonstrate continuous pursuit as it is not one of the designated administrative review options specified by the relevant laws and regulations.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) (listing the administrative review options for continuous pursuit).  Instead, an increased rating claim submitted on a VA Form 21-526EZ establishes the beginning of a new review period.  

Here, the Veteran has challenged the rating assigned in the December 2023 rating decision and its decision in the subsequent March 2024 Supplemental Claim decision.  However, where the December 2023 rating decision corresponds with the September 23, 2023, Intent to File discussed above, the March 2024 decision corresponds to a separate increased rating claim filed on March 7, 2024, on a VA Form 21-526EZ.  Therefore, continuous pursuit has not been shown, and in order to best address the relevant evidence of record, the Board has styled his appeal as claims for increased ratings over two rating periods (a period between September 23, 2023, and December 14, 2023, and a period beginning on March 7, 2024).  

Rating Period Between September 23, 2023, and December 14, 2023

In a December 2023 VA examination, the Veteran described hearing loss that impacted ordinary conditions of daily life, such as the ability to work, and was characterized by the use of caption call when using the phone and a need for people to repeat themselves when talking to him.  The December 2023 examiner conducted an audiological examination, diagnosed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and reported the puretone thresholds, in dBs, as follows:

?????? 	?????? 	?????? 	HERTZ????? 	?????? 

?????? 	1000???? 	2000????? 	3000????? 	4000????? 

RIGHT????? 	25???? 	30?? 	40? 	40 

LEFT????? 	25?? 	25?? 	45	50

The average puretone thresholds were 34 dBs and 36 dBs in the right and left ears, respectively.  Word recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Word List were, at worst, 94 percent in the right ear and 90 percent in the left ear.  Applying the December 2023 findings to Table VI reveals a numeric designation of Level I in the right ear and Level II in the left ear.  The numeric designation in the right ear (Level I) along with the numeric designation for the left ear (Level II) reflect a noncompensable rating for bilateral hearing loss.  There are no clinical records adequate for rating purposes that reflect any hearing worse than that reported at the December 2023 VA examination.

The Board has considered the Veteran's assertion that his hearing throughout the period on appeal was worse than currently rated.  He is competent to describe his hearing difficulty; however, his description of his service-connected disability must be considered in conjunction with the clinical evidence of record, as well as the pertinent rating criteria.  In this regard, ratings are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).  

Thus, the Board must predicate its determination on the basis of the results of the audiological studies of record that are adequate for rating purposes.  Based on the results from the December 2023 VA examination discussed above, the criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met for the period on appeal.  Therefore, the medical evidence does not support a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss for the period between September 23, 2023, and December 14, 2023.  

Rating Period Since March 7, 2024

In a March 25, 2024, VA examination, the examiner diagnosed bilateral hearing loss that did not affect ordinary conditions of daily living, to include the ability to work.  The examiner conducted an audiological examination and found that the puretone thresholds in dBs, were as follows:

?????? 	?????? 	?????? 	HERTZ????? 	?????? 

?????? 	1000???? 	2000????? 	3000????? 	4000????? 

RIGHT????? 	20???? 	25?? 	40 	40

LEFT????? 	25 	25?? 	40	35

The average puretone thresholds were 31 dBs in the right and left ears, respectively.  Word recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Word List were 100 percent in both the right and left ears.  Applying the March 2024 findings to Table VI reveals numeric designations of Level I in the right ear and Level I in the left ear.  

The numeric designation in the right ear (Level I) along with the numeric designation for the left ear (Level I) reflect a noncompensable rating for bilateral hearing loss.  There are no clinical records adequate for rating purposes that reflect any hearing worse than that reported at the March 2024 VA examination.

The Board has considered the lay statements submitted regarding the Veteran's hearing difficulty.  He is competent to describe his hearing impairment; however, as explained above, his description of his service-connected disability must be considered in conjunction with the clinical evidence of record, as well as the pertinent rating criteria.  In this regard, ratings are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).  

Thus, the Board must predicate its determination on the basis of the results of the audiological studies of record since March 7, 2024, that are adequate for rating purposes.  Based on the results from the March 2024 VA examination discussed above, the criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met for the period on appeal.  Therefore, the medical evidence does not support a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss for the period since March 7, 2024. 

The Board has considered whether referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted.  In exceptional cases where schedular ratings are found to be inadequate, consideration may be given to assigning an extraschedular rating.  38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1); Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008).  In this case, the record does not establish that the rating criteria are inadequate.

To the contrary, the very symptoms that the Veteran described throughout the two periods on appeal and the findings made by the VA examiners, to include impaired hearing, are "like or similar" to those explicitly listed in the rating criteria, which considers the level of hearing loss as tested in audiometric evaluations.  Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 443 (2002).  Specifically, during the period on appeal between September and December 2023, the Veteran described hearing loss for which he used caption call when making phone calls and required people to repeat themselves when talking to him.  Subsequently in the March 2024 VA examination, he reported that his time in service resulted in bilateral hearing loss.  

In this regard, the rating criteria for hearing loss were last revised, effective June 10, 1999.  See 64 Fed. Reg. 25,000 (May 11, 1999).  In forming these revisions, VA sought the assistance of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in developing criteria that contemplated situations in which a veteran's hearing loss was of such a type that speech discrimination tests might not reflect the severity of communicative functioning that the veteran experienced or that was otherwise an extreme handicap in the presence of any environmental noise, even with the use of hearing aids.

VHA had found through clinical studies of veterans with hearing loss that when certain periods of impairment are present, a speech discrimination test conducted in a quiet room with amplification of the sounds did not always reflect the extent of the impairment experienced in the ordinary environment.  The decibel threshold requirements for applications of Table VIA were based on the findings and recommendations of the VHA.

The intended effect of the revision was to fairly and accurately assess the hearing disabilities of veterans as reflected in a real-life industrial setting.  59 Fed. Reg. 17,295 (April 12, 1994).  Accordingly, the functional impairment due to hearing loss that is compounded by background or environmental noise is a disability picture that is considered in the current schedular rating criteria.

Therefore, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss, use of aids such as caption call, and need for people to repeat themselves when talking to him are factors contemplated in the regulations and rating criteria as defined, and ratings are based on the overall severity and frequency of the disability, to include subjective complaints.

Finally, there is no indication that the average industrial impairment from his disability would be to such a degree as to warrant the assignment of higher ratings.  Accordingly, referral for extraschedular consideration is not in order.

The Board has considered the lay statements submitted by the Veteran regarding the status of his hearing loss throughout the two periods on appeal.  He is competent to report symptoms and describe his observations because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses.  However, he is not competent to offer opinions as to the specific level of disability according to the appropriate diagnostic code of any current disorder due to the medical complexity of the matters involved.

Such competent evidence has been provided by the medical personnel who have examined the Veteran during the current appeal and who have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with the evaluations.  The medical findings (as provided in the VA examinations and clinical records) directly address the criteria under which his bilateral hearing loss is evaluated.

As the clinicians have the requisite medical expertise to render medical opinions regarding the degrees of impairment caused by his bilateral hearing loss throughout the two periods on appeal and had sufficient facts and data on which to base their conclusions, the Board attaches greater probative weight to the clinical findings than to the lay statements that have been submitted.  Based on the above, an effective date of September 23, 2023, for the award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted and the appeal is otherwise denied.   

Consideration has been given to assigning staged ratings for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss.  However, at no time during the period on appeal has his disability warranted higher schedular ratings than those assigned.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).   

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record for the Board's consideration.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
