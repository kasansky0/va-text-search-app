DOCKET NO. 210401-462102
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

As the claim of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on August 18, 2020 was granted in full, the appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment of the cost of the August 18, 2020, non-VA medical services provided to the Veteran by Mobile Medic Ambulance Service, Inc.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on August 18, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §?20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1983 to March 1987. 

The decision on appeal was issued in March 2021 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

On April 1, 2021, the Board received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the Veteran, electing the Direct Review docket for the issue decided in the March 2021 decision.

Dismissal

The Veteran received non-VA medical services from Mobile Medic Ambulance Service, Inc. on August 18, 2020. See Medical Expense Reimbursement (1725/1725A/1728) - VHA (August 2024). A March 2021 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) decision denied payment for the services provided to the Veteran, determining that the claim was untimely. See Id. at 9. This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision. See VA 10182 (April 2021). 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

The Board concludes that the issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on August 18, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801. 

In this case, following the Veteran's submission of the VA Form 10182, the AOJ further researched the claim history. Upon additional research, it was concluded that Mobile Medic Ambulance Service, Inc. met the criteria for reimbursement for the services provided to the Veteran on August 18, 2020. A May 2021 VHA decision shows that VA approved the claim for payment for the medical expenses billed by Mobile Medic Ambulance Service, Inc. and payment was issued. See Medical Expense Reimbursement (1725/1725A/1728) - VHA at 5 (August 2024). 

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the August 18, 2020, non-VA medical services constitutes a reversal of the denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal. As the Veteran's claim has been approved, he has no present case or controversy for the Board to adjudicate with regard to this or any other matter as contemplated by?38 U.S.C. §?7104. 

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(d).
