ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer with metastasis to bladder and lymph nodes and secondary mantle cell lymphoma (PC) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his PC is related to his active service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for PC have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from December 1977 to December 1981.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The Veteran selected the direct review docket in his July 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD) to the Board; as such, evidence up until the rating decision on appeal will be considered.  

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The evidence must show (1) the existence of a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1991). 

In this case, a July 2023 VA examination shows the Veteran was diagnosed with PC in 2010, as well as lymphoma and bladder cancer years later when his PC metastasized.  As such, a current disability has been shown.  Regarding an in-service incident, the Veteran contends that he was exposed to asbestos, engine fuel toxins, and freon while in service.  In addition, a July 2023 VA Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) memorandum further noted the Veteran was exposed to asbestos while serving aboard a ship in the Navy.  Logbook records further appear to show the Veteran served aboard a ship from February 1980 to July 1980.  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the first two prongs regarding a current disability and in-service event/injury have been met.  

Regarding nexus, a July 2023 VA medical opinion found that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's PC is related to his asbestos-related exposures in service.  The examiner explained that there is evidence in medical literature of a relationship between asbestos exposure and PC and cited to specific supporting medical literature.  

The Board assigns little probative weight to the negative VA opinion of record, as the examiner merely made generic statements about the definition of cancer and risk factors for the development of PC.  The examiner did not provide any rationale specific to the Veteran's case that supported its negative nexus conclusion.  

Thus, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise that the Veteran's PC is related to his active service.  Service connection for PC is granted.
