ORDER

Service connection for stimulant use disorder, cocaine, with alcohol use disorder, is denied.

Given the benefit of the doubt, service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's substance use and alcohol use disorders are due to the Veteran's willful misconduct and are precluded from serving as a primary diagnosis for service connection.

2.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran has tinnitus which began during active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for an alcohol and substance use disorder are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.301, 3.303.

2. //The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38U.S.C. §§1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38C.F.R. §§3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably in the U.S. Navy from October 2022 to June 2023.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In an April 2024 VA form 10182 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran appealed this decision and elected the direct review docket. By selecting the direct review docket, the Board must base its decision on the evidence that was before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the February 2024 decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

1. Service connection for stimulant use disorder, cocaine, mild with alcohol use disorder, mild is denied.

A veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation if there is a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. In other words, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

The Veteran contends that her stimulant use disorder with cocaine and her alcohol use disorder are due to military service.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for mental disorders in November 2023. The diagnoses listed above were confirmed. The Veteran reports that she began using cocaine in the military and continues to use it once per week. She began drinking alcohol in college, but her alcohol use increased while in the service. She tested positive for cocaine use while in the military, was placed on restriction for one month, and eventually discharged from service in May 2023 due to willful misconduct and drug abuse. 

For claims such as this one filed after October 31, 1990, service connection cannot be granted for a disability that is the result of a veteran's own willful misconduct or the result of his or her abuse of alcohol or drugs. 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(a). Drug abuse is the use of illegal drugs (including prescription drugs that are illegally or illicitly obtained), the intentional use of prescription or non-prescription drugs for a purpose other than the medically intended use, or the use of substances other than alcohol to enjoy their intoxicating effects. 38 C.F.R. § 3.301. In this case, the Veteran has documented willful misconduct, which included the abuse of cocaine. The evidence also shows that the Veteran has had an alcohol use disorder, which is a disorder that cannot serve as the primary service connection diagnosis, as service connection cannot be granted as the result of the abuse of alcohol.

Willful misconduct means an act involving conscious wrongdoing or known prohibited action. It involves deliberate or intentional wrongdoing with knowledge of, or wanton and reckless disregard of, its probable consequences. Mere technical violation of police regulations or ordinances will not per se constitute willful misconduct. Willful misconduct will not be determinative unless it is the proximate cause of injury, disease, or death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n).

The phrase "willful misconduct," in its ordinary meaning, entails three requirements for the Board to find the phrase applicable. The Board must (1) identify conduct; (2) the identified conduct must be misconduct; and (3) the identified misconduct must be willful. Martin v. McDonald, 761 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Willful misconduct means an act involving conscious wrongdoing or known prohibited action and involves deliberate or intentional wrongdoing with knowledge of or wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences. Id. at 1369-70. Willful misconduct refers to an act of conscious wrongdoing, involving elements of intent and voluntariness. Id. at 1370.

While alcohol abuse and drug abuse that are a secondary result of an organic disease or disability is not considered willful misconduct (see 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.301(c)(2), 3.301(c)(3), where, as here, service connection for a primary disability has been denied, secondary service connection is precluded as a matter of law. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b) (providing for service connection for a disability only where such disability is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by, a disease or injury that is already service connected).

The Veteran's substance abuse, both alcohol and drugs, cannot be a primary service connection diagnosis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(a) precludes service connection when there is abuse of alcohol or drugs (alcohol use disorder) or when there is willful misconduct (cocaine use disorder). Given that the abuse of alcohol and cocaine is not able to serve as a primary diagnosis, service connection for alcohol and substance abuse must be denied.

2. Given the benefit of the doubt, service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran contends that she experiences tinnitus which is due to her military service. Specifically, in October 2023 in a lay statement the Veteran wrote that she experiences tinnitus which she first noticed in 2023 while in the service. She reports an MOS of Logistics Specialist, with exposure to noise trauma including jets, cargo and passenger planes, and flight line noises. In addition, she reports shooting pistols, not always with hearing protection available.

The Veteran submitted an initial claim for service connection for tinnitus in October 2023. She was not afforded a VA examination with regard to this claim.

Initially, the Board notes that unlike hearing loss, tinnitus is a disorder that is readily observable by laypersons and does not require medical expertise to establish its existence. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App.370 (2002). Furthermore, while the Veteran's available STRs are negative for specific complaints of tinnitus, the Veteran is competent to report a history of tinnitus that began in service. See 38 C.F.R. §3.159(a)(2); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App.362, 368 (2005); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994). In its capacity as a finder of fact, the Board finds the Veteran is credible as to her reports of the onset and recurrence of tinnitus symptoms. She is also competent to comment on the onset and frequency of his tinnitus. Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient evidence to establish etiology if the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition and lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Here, under Charles the Veteran is competent to identify the medical condition of tinnitus and her lay statements describe tinnitus beginning in service. In an October 2022 office visit, the patient reportedly denied tinnitus at that time, but she reports that the tinnitus started during the next year. There is also no negative medical opinion in this case. In this case, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran's competent and credible lay evidence is sufficient to establish a nexus between service and tinnitus and service connection for tinnitus is warranted. 38 C.F.R. §3.303(a).
