ORDER

1. Entitlement to an initial rating of 100 percent (maximum) for service connection for schizoaffective disorder, bipolar subtype, and alcohol use disorder (schizoaffective disorder) is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of July 5, 2016, but no earlier, for eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the period on review, the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder symptoms most closely approximated total occupational and social impairment.

2. Based on the grants herein, the Veteran has at least one total service-connected disability permanent in nature from July 5, 2016.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial disability rating of 100 percent (maximum) for schizoaffective disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9211.

2. An effective date of July 5, 2016, but no earlier, is warranted for the grant of DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3020, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1987 to January 1992. 

These matters have a long procedural history and come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). These matters were previously before the Board, and in March 2023 the Board remanded for further development. The Board finds there has been substantial compliance with its remand directives. See Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (1999); Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Initial rating for schizoaffective disorder.

Legal Criteria

Disability ratings are determined by application of a ratings schedule which is based, as far as can practically be determined, on the average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Each service-connected disability is rated on the basis of specific criteria identified by Diagnostic Codes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. The degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for a loss of working time proportionate to the severity of the disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. However, pyramiding, that is the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when evaluating a Veteran's service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; see Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

The Board notes that the Veteran's service-connected schizoaffective disorder is rated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 9211. DC 9211 is rated pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

Per the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

The list of symptoms under the rating criteria are meant to be examples of symptoms that would warrant a particular rating, but are not meant to be exhaustive, and the Board need not find all or even most of the symptoms to award a specific rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442-43 (2002). However, a veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration, and that those symptoms have resulted in the type of occupational and social impairment associated with that percentage. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 117-18 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38?C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claim of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38?U.S.C. §?5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Factual Background and Analysis

In the June 2023 rating decision on appeal here, the AOJ granted service connection for schizoaffective disorder with staged ratings of 70 percent effective July 5, 2016, and 100 percent effective July 17, 2021. The 100 percent rating is a full grant of the benefit sought; as such, the issue in the instant appeal is for an increase of the 70 percent rating effective July 5, 2016.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2016 where the examiner determined the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. Based on the detailed social, occupational, and mental history provided by the examiner, the Board finds the November 2016 examination and opinion adequate for rating purposes and assigns it high probative weight. 

The VA examiner documented symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, impaired judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, suicidal ideation, and persistent delusions or hallucinations. The VA examiner also documented behavioral observations of unkempt appearance, labile mood consisting of hysterical crying, inappropriate laughing, and extreme agitation; hysterical affect notable for frequent emotional outbursts; speech fluctuated between being soft and childlike to becoming tearful, loud, and angry; motor activity was unremarkable; thought process and judgment also fluctuated, in that during the examination her judgment and thinking were impaired, but while she waited in the examiner's office for an hour for her transportation, her thinking and judgment were grossly intact. Ultimately, the VA examiner opined that given the extreme inconsistency in the Veteran's mood and behavior during the examination, their professional opinion was that the Veteran may be exaggerating. 

The Veteran's representative argues VA did not consider all evidence of record when assigning disability ratings and effective dates for schizoaffective disorder. See May 2024 Veteran's Memorandum of Law. (The Board notes the Veteran is represented by a law firm, however, an accredited claims agent and not an attorney submitted the referenced argument.) Specifically, the representative asserts a private opinion from psychologist C.M., PhD, confirms the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder most approximated with 100 percent disability rating since 2016. See id. 

Psychologist C.M., PhD, provided an opinion regarding the Veteran's psychiatric disabilities in January 2022. C.M., PhD, ultimately opined that the Veteran's overall psychiatric symptom presentation is severe and has at least as likely as not caused her total occupational social impairment since at least July 2016. Based on the very thorough review of the Veteran's VA file and detailed analysis, the Board finds this January 2022 private opinion adequate for rating purposes and assigns it high probative weight. 

This assessment was attributed to the Veteran's symptoms of near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately ,and effectively; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships; suicidal ideation; impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence; persistent delusions or hallucinations; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene. 

C.M., PhD, further opines that the Veteran's posttraumatic stress disorder, psychosis, and depressive symptoms have ultimately rendered her fully unable to successfully secure and follow substantially gainful employment since at least July 2016. Moreover, C.M., PhD, specifically addresses the November 2016 VA examiner's opinion and notates they do not believe the Veteran was "exaggerating" as the examiner stated. 

The Board notes there are conflicting medical opinions and documentation of symptoms regarding the severity of the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder in the record for the period on review. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran (as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.102), the Board finds the evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's symptoms most closely approximated total occupational and social impairment. Accordingly, an initial rating of 100 percent (maximum) is warranted.

The Board notes the Veteran also claimed a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) based on the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder. 

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled. Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994). Thus, if VA has found a veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need (or authority) to otherwise rate that veteran totally disabled on any other basis. See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

However, a grant of a 100 percent disability does not always render the issue of TDIU moot. VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether the Veteran's disabilities establish entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). Specifically, SMC may be warranted if the Veteran has a 100 percent disability rating for a single disability, and VA finds that TDIU is warranted based solely on the disabilities other than the disability that is rated at 100 percent. See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 294.

Here, as described above, the Veteran is service connected for schizoaffective disorder at 100 percent since the initial grant of service connection. Accordingly, entitlement to a TDIU is moot. Entitlement to SMC is also moot because the Veteran is only service connected for schizoaffective disorder.

2. Earlier effective date for eligibility to DEA benefits.

Basic eligibility for certification of DEA exists if the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service, and either (1) has a permanent total service-connected disability; (2) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; (3) died as a result of a service-connected disability; or (4) if a service member is on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces and, for a period of more than 90 days, has been listed by VA as missing in action, captured in line of duty by a hostile force, or forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by a foreign government or power. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a).

Basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status was established from July 17, 2021, in the June 2023 rating decision, which is on appeal here. The finding is based on the 100 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected schizoaffective disorder effective the same date. 

As discussed above, the Board has awarded an initial 100 percent rating for the schizoaffective disorder. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran (as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.102), eligibility for DEA benefits is established and is shown from the earlier effective date of July 5, 2016.
