ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent for pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for pseudofolliculitis barbae is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected PFB has been manifested by one characteristic of disfigurement - lesion(s) with elevated surface contour. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a rating of 10 percent for pseudofolliculitis barbae have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7806. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from March 1989 to July 1989.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for pseudofolliculitis barbae, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Disability ratings are to be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

In considering the severity of a disability, the Board must consider the entire medical history of the Veteran so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of any disability present.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board"). 

The Board is charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence.  Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).  Indeed, in Jefferson v. Principi, 271 F.3d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), citing its decision in Madden, recognized that that Board had an inherent fact-finding ability.  Id. at 1076; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to weigh and assess the evidence.  Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992). 

As a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is satisfactory, the Board may also properly consider internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the Veteran, and the Veteran's demeanor when testifying at a hearing.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996). 

Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent for PFB is granted. 

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for his service-connected pseudofolliculitis barbae, which is rated as noncompensable under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7806, effective August 1, 2022.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118; Diagnostic Code 7806. 

In the June 2022 VA Form 21-525EZ, the Veteran stated that he has a severe case of PFB, and that he cannot shave without exposure of the scarring.  

By way of history, in a November 2022 rating decision service connection for pseudofolliculitis was granted with an evaluation of 0 percent under DC 7806, effective August 1, 2022.  In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, wherein he referenced the November 2022 rating decision and requested a higher rating for his PFB.  This form is accepted as a Supplemental Claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(c), 3.2501.  The AOJ denied the Veteran's claim in the May 2023 rating decision on appeal.

Under DC 7806, a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: (1) characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or (2) characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for Diagnostic Codes 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824. 

A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: (1) characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or (2) at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or (3) intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.  Id. 

A 30 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: (1) characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (2) systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  Id.

A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: (1) characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (2) constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.  Id.

Alternatively, the General Rating Formula states to rate the condition as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DCs 7801, 7802, 7804, or 7805), depending upon the predominant disability.  Id. 

For purposes of evaluation of under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, the eight characteristics of disfigurement are: a scar that is five (13 centimeters) or more inches in length; a scar that is at least one-quarter of an inch (0.6 centimeters), wide at the widest part; surface contour of the scar that is elevated or depressed on palpation; a scar that is adherent to underlying tissue; skin that is hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches (39 square centimeters); skin texture that is abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding six square inches (39 square centimeters); underlying soft tissue that is missing in an area exceeding six square inches (39 square centimeters); and skin that is indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches (39 square centimeters).  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800, Note 1.

These characteristics of disfigurement "may be caused by one scar or by multiple scars; the characteristics required to assign a particular evaluation need not be caused by a single scar in order to assign that evaluation."  Id. at Note (5).

Under DC 7800, relating to "scar(s) of the head, face, or neck" due to burns or other causes, a 10 percent rating is warranted for scars that are located on the head, face, or neck when there is one characteristic of disfigurement.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7800.  A 30 percent evaluation is assigned when there is "visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips)"; or when there are two or three characteristics of disfigurement.  Id.  A 50 percent evaluation is assigned when there is "visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or assymetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips)", or with four or five characteristics of disfigurement.  Id.

VA regulations explicitly state that systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).

In a September 2022 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with pseudofolliculitis barbae.  The examiner stated that the veteran has typical expected appearance of PFB without evidence of infection or scarring.  Referencing medical literature, the examiner noted "Papules and pustules in sites of hair removal are the characteristic lesions of pseudofolliculitis barbae: Skin lesions - The 2 to 5 mm, firm papules may be skin colored, erythematous, or hyperpigmented (picture 1A-C). Loops of hair emerging from the follicular orifice and re-entering the skin may be visible on the skin surface (picture 2)."

The examiner noted the presence of hyperpigmented papules, which were worse on the Veteran's upper neck, with few scattered skin-colored papules on sides of the face and no apparent scarring.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's PFB covered less than five percent of his total body and less than five percent of the exposed area and, despite also noting his hyperpigmented papules, the examiner stated that there were no characteristic lesions visible at the time of the examination. 

During the September 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he started getting razor bumps during service and was issued a shaving profile and that he now experiences itchiness and irritation with shaving.  He further reported that he had not sought medical treatment for his condition. 

In the April 2023 VA examination, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran presented for the examination with a full beard and a few scattered bumps along his neck area.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's PFB covered less than five percent of his total body and less than five percent of the exposed area and that there were no characteristic lesions visible at the time of the examination.  The examiner noted that the Veteran has been treated with medication in the past twelve months, to include Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Propionate cream, 1%/0.05%, Mupirocin ointment, 2%, ketoconazole topical shampoo, 2%, and that treatment was prescribed for less than six weeks. 

As stated above, the Veteran reported seeking treatment through his primary care physician and that he has been advised not to shave due to the severe breakouts he experiences when he does. 

In May 2022 and March 2023 letters, the Veteran's primary care physician stated that the Veteran received treatment for PFB and has been advised not to shave due to severe scarring, bleeding, and breakouts due to PFB.  The physician noted that the Veteran's PFB has been an ongoing concern, and the Veteran has been advised not the shave to prevent infection.  The physician further reported that the Veteran has been prescribed Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Propionate cream; Mupirocin ointment, ketoconazole topical shampoo, and doxycycline capsule, hyclate 100 mg. 

After reviewing the record, the Board finds that an initial 10 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae.  The September 2022 and April 2023 VA examinations documented that the Veteran's PFB was manifested by hyperpigmented papules, which were worse on his upper neck, with few scattered skin-colored papules on sides of the face, and/or a few scattered bumps along his neck area.  As noted above, the September 2022 VA examiner reported that characteristic lesions of pseudofolliculitis barbae are manifested by 2 to 5 mm., firm papules.  As the surface contour of these lesions are elevated, the Board finds that an initial 10 percent rating is warranted under DC 7800, for one characteristic of disfigurement.  The issue of entitlement to a disability in excess of 10 percent for PFB is addressed in the remand below.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for pseudofolliculitis barbae is remanded.

Unless the issue or issues can be granted in full, the Board shall remand the appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A if the error occurred prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction decision on appeal.? 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).? The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.? Id.? The remand must specify the action to be taken by the AOJ.? Id. 

As noted above, the Veteran has submitted two statements from his private primary  care physician at Internal Medical Associates of Plano.  The physician reported that the Veteran was under care for his PFB and had been prescribed medication.  However, no development was completed to obtain these records.  Therefore, this must be accomplished on remand.

The matter is therefore REMANDED for the following action:  

Make arrangement to obtain the Veteran's complete medical treatment records from Internal Medical Associates of Plano.
