FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The December 2024 VA Form 10182 attempted to appeal an April 2024 rating decision issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) which implemented an April 2024 Board decision that granted an increased rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease, degenerative arthritis, and intervertebral disc syndrome from March 11, 2015; however, the Board does not have the authority to review the April 2024 rating decision as to this issue.  

2. The December 2024 VA Form 10182 attempted to appeal an April 2024 rating decision issued by the AOJ which implemented an April 2024 Board decision that granted an increased rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve from December 9, 2016; however, the Board does not have the authority to review the April 2024 rating decision as to this issue.  

3. Throughout the review period, the Veteran's depressive disorder with anxiety has resulted in total occupational and social impairment.  

4. Throughout the review period, the Veteran's headache symptoms have been manifested with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  

5. The Veteran's allergic rhinitis has not been manifested by greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides, complete obstruction on one side, or polyps.

6. The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea did not result in chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, nor did it require a tracheostomy at any time during the review period.

7. From May 29, 2012, the evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran's service-connected migraines and obstructive sleep apnea rendered him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.

8. The evidence shows that the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent schedular rating for service-connected depressive disorder with anxiety and the combined rating for the remaining service-connected disabilities totals at least 60 percent beginning August 1, 2014.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the Air Force from September 1969 to September 1989.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in November 2014 and April 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the December 30, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  The AMA Evidence Submission docket allows for the submission of additional evidence in support of an appeal either with the submission of the December 2020 VA Form 10182 or within 90 days of December 30, 2024.  The record was open to submit additional evidence from December 30, 2024, to March 30, 2025.

The Board has only considered the evidence of record at the time of the November 2024 and April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

A review of the claims file did reveal a possible duty to assist error related to the claim of an increased rating for depressive disorder with anxiety.  During the May 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he was recently hospitalized due to his mental health.  However, the record does not indicate that the AOJ attempted to obtain the private treatment records related to the recent hospitalization.  Given the favorable finding herein, the Board finds remand to obtain the records would offer no benefit the Veteran, and therefore the Board will proceed with adjudication on the merits.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (noting that "[a] veteran's interest may be better served by prompt resolution of his claims rather than by further remands to cure procedural errors that, at the end of the day, may be irrelevant to final resolution and may indeed merely delay resolution").

Dismissal

1. Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 20 percent for degenerative arthritis of lumbar spine, degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome, and lumbar intervertebral disc bulge from March 11, 2015

2. Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve from December 9, 2016

In an April 2024 decision, the Board granted entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 20 percent for degenerative arthritis of lumbar spine, degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome, and lumbar intervertebral disc bulge from March 11, 2015, and entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve from December 9, 2016.  The AOJ subsequently implemented the Board decision in an April 2024 rating decision, which the Veteran and his representative then attempted to appeal in a December 2024 VA Form 10182.  However, an AOJ decision implementing a Board grant is not a "decision" that the Board has the authority to review under 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  See Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

To the extent that the December 2024 VA Form 10182 may be construed as a motion for reconsideration of the April 2024 Board decision, such a matter is a separate consideration by the Chairman and not addressed herein.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

In rating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for the higher rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time, based on the facts found.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App.  505 (2007).  A claim for increased rating remains in controversy when less than the maximum available benefit is awarded AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993).  Reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  

3. Entitlement to an initial increased rating of 100 percent for depressive disorder with anxiety

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased rating for his service-connected depressive disorder with anxiety.

The Veteran's depressive disorder with anxiety is rated at 70 percent under Diagnostic Code 9434 for major depressive disorder, which follows the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  Pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and the inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  Id.  

A 100 percent rating is warranted if there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; gross inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.  Id.  

Symptoms listed in VA's General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating.  Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). 

The VA is required to perform a "holistic analysis" in which it "assesses the severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms of the Veteran's service-connected mental disorder; quantifies the level of occupational and social impairment caused by those signs and symptoms; and assigns an evaluation that most nearly approximates that level of occupational and social impairment."  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017).  

After careful consideration of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's depressive disorder with anxiety symptoms warrant an initial 100 percent rating throughout the review period, as the Veteran's symptoms result in total social and occupational impairment.    

Symptoms of the Veteran's depressive disorder with anxiety resulting in total occupational and social impairment include persistent delusions or hallucinations, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, suicidal ideation, near-continuous panic of depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately or effectively, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, and chronic sleep impairment.  These symptoms have affected the Veteran's ability to participate in social relationships and engage in employment-related tasks and independent living tasks.  

The Veteran's VA treatments include reports of daily depression and anxiety as well as daily delusions and hallucinations.  During a July 2017 Agent Orange Registry Examination, the Veteran reported feeling depressed and anxious almost every day.  A November 2020 Sleep Clinic Note indicates that the Veteran reported seeing "spirits" during the day after having difficulty sleep at night.  In a December 2022 Sleep Clinic Note, the Veteran reported experiencing "visions" upon awakening from sleep and seeing figures and people whenever he awakens at night.  During a December 2022 Functional Assessment, the Veteran expressed frustration with the hallucinations he had been experiencing.  He also reported decreased participation in leisure and recreational activities and limited relationships due to feeling tired.  The Veteran was assessed with moderately severe depression and moderate anxiety.  The Veteran continued to report awakening with hallucinations in January 2023.  An October 2024 Functional Assessment revealed moderately severe symptoms of depression and severe symptoms of anxiety as the Veteran reported having little interest in doing things and low motivation.  His VA treatment records revealed continued complaints of hallucinations in September 2024 and October 2024.

The Veteran provided statements from his family which revealed symptoms of chronic sleep impairment, isolation, and paranoia inhibiting the Veteran's ability to function independently or establish and maintain relationships.  In an October 2020 statement from the Veteran's former spouse, C.S., she stated that the Veteran does not sleep well resulting in him being tired and sluggish with an inability to concentrate or process thoughts.  The former spouse also reported that the Veteran often does not understand what she is saying, or it takes him a long time to process it.  She also stated that the Veteran rambles and talks in circles.  The former spouse stated that she has to remind the Veteran him to call their son.  Additionally, the Veteran does not interact with people, avoids crowds, and is isolated.  Due to his paranoia, the Veteran stays at home, and she goes grocery shopping for the Veteran because he does not want to leave the house as he thinks people are looking at him, spying on him, or talking about him.  C.S. stated that the Veteran's mental health issues have worsened over the years affecting his relationships and his ability to function independently.  

The Veteran's brother, F.S. and sister, W.B. also stated that the Veteran has a difficult time maintaining relationships as he does not trust people, angers easily, and lacks social skills.  See Buddy/Lay Statements, November 2020.  

In November 2020 correspondence from the Veteran, he reported that he is only able to sleep about an hour at night and wakes up seeing ghosts, spirits, or spiders on the ceiling.  His difficulty with sleep leaves him feeling fatigued and lacking motivation.  He also reported self-isolation due to his paranoia and that he moved onto a military base as it helps with his paranoia.     

In a February 2016 Disability and Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) completed by Dr. H.H.G., she opined that the Veteran's symptoms of unspecified depressive disorder result in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, which is indicative to a 70 percent rating under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  However, she also determined that the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder is manifested by symptoms more nearly approximate to a 100 percent disability rating to include peristent delusions or hallucinations and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living.  Other symptoms attributable to the Veteran's depressive disorder include depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; near-continuous panic or depression affecting ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss; flattened affect; impairment of short-term and long-term memory; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships; suicidal ideation; and, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene.

Dr. H.H.G. also opined that the Veteran is socially isolated and withdrawn, experiences overt hallucinations, and struggles to perform some of his daily living tasks.  For example, she noted that the Veteran shops at the grocery store at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. to avoid others.  She also noted that the Veteran reports auditory and visual hallucinations and delusions consisting of hearing voices and seeing shadow figures.  Additionally, he sometimes wakes up and feels like he is being attacked by the shadow figures. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in May 2024.  He was diagnosed with unspecified depressive disorder.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms result in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.  Symptoms attributable to the Veteran's condition include depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks that occur weekly or less often; chronic sleep impairment; flattened affect; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances; and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  The examiner also indicated that the Veteran experienced suicidal ideation, social isolation, loneliness, and paranoia.  The examiner stated that the Veteran was recently hospitalized for anxiety.  

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively favors fining that the Veteran's depressive disorder with anxiety has resulted in a total social and occupational impairment throughput the review period to warrant an initial 100 percent rating under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9434.  The Veteran's symptoms of chronic sleep impairment, near-continuous panic and depression, persistent delusions and hallucinations, isolation, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living have resulted in an in an inability to function socially or occupationally throughout the entirety of the review period.  The evidence indicates that throughout the review period, the Veteran has experienced hallucinations and paranoia, isolates at home, and is unable to perform tasks of daily living such as grocery shopping.  Due to the frequency, duration, and severity of the Veteran's depressive disorder with anxiety symptoms, the Board finds that his symptoms have resulted in total occupational and social impairment.  Accordingly, entitlement to an initial 100 percent rating for depressive disorder with anxiety is granted.

4. Entitlement to an initial increased rating of 50 percent for migraines

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a 50 percent rating for his service-connected headaches.  

The Veteran's migraine headaches are currently evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.214a, Diagnostic Code 8100.  Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months.  A maximum 50 percent rating is warranted for very frequent completely prostrating attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  

The rating criteria of Diagnostic Code 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?245, 252 (2018).  This renders 38?C.F.R. §§?4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under Diagnostic Code 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation.  Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

Additionally, prostrating means "causing extreme exhaustion, powerlessness, debilitation or incapacitation with substantial inability to engage in ordinary activities."  Completely prostrating means extreme exhaustion or powerlessness with essentially total inability to engage in ordinary activities.  See VA Adjudication Manual, M21-1MR, Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, Section N, Topic 7, Block b.  Although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, it is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 and conduct its own analysis before determining whether the M21-1 provisions may be relied upon to support its decision, thereby fulfilling part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases for its decision.  See Overton v. Willkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 263-64 (2018).

In Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) decided that "the phrase 'characteristic prostrating attacks' plainly describes migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality."  

The rating criteria for a 50 percent rating contain several undefined phrases.  The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253.  The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraines attack must render the veteran entirely powerless.  Id.  The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract."  Id. (internal citation omitted).  Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability."  Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in Diagnostic Code 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  Pierce v. Principi, 18?Vet. App.?440, 445-46 (2004).

In Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67 (2020), the Court held that Diagnostic Code 8100 contemplates all migraine symptoms.  Therefore, to evaluate migraines under Diagnostic Code 8100, VA must consider all symptoms experienced due to migraine attacks and then rate the symptoms based on the frequency, duration, and economic impact of those attacks.  The Court commented that this analysis is similar to that used to assign ratings for psychiatric disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

After careful consideration of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's migraine headaches have been manifested with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability from May 29, 2012, to warrant a 50 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.  

During a January 2013 VA examination, the Veteran reported getting six to seven headaches per month.  The examiner determined that the Veteran experiences headache pain described as pulsating or throbbing pain, pain localized to one side of the head, and pain on both sides of the head.  His non-headache symptoms include nausea, sensitivity to light, and changes in vision.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's headaches impact his ability to work as the headaches limit his focus and concentration and slow him down at work.

In a June 2016 DBQ completed by Dr. H.S., he determined that the Veteran had a diagnosis of migraine headaches with symptoms of pulsating or throbbing head pain, pain on both sides of the head, pain that worsens with physical activity, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and changes in vision.  Dr. H.S. further determined that the Veteran's headaches last less than one day and are characteristic prostrating attacks that occur more frequently than once per month.  Dr. H.S. also opined that the Veteran's headaches are characterized as very frequent prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine pain and the Veteran's headaches reduced his power of concentration resulting in the Veteran missing several days of work and requiring frequent unscheduled breaks throughout the day.  

The Veteran also completed a Residual Functional Capacity Evaluation for his headaches in June 2016 administered by Dr. H.S.  It was reported that the Veteran would miss three or more days of work per month due to headaches, leave early three or more days per month due to headaches, and for more than three days per month he would not stay focused for at least 7 hours of the 8-hour workday.  Dr. H.H.G. also opined that the Veteran would not be able to maintain substantially gainful employment due to his headaches.

In a June 2016 medical opinion completed by Dr. H.S. in conjunction with the June 2016 DBQ, he stated that the Veteran experiences debilitating migraines approximately eight to 10 times per month with prostrating episodes occurring on average of two or three times per month.  Dr. H.S. explained that the Veteran's prostrating attacks force the Veteran to lie down in a dark environment for several hours at a time.  Dr. H.S. concluded his report by opining that the Veteran's migraines are debilitating and prevent him from sustaining gainful work.  

In a more recent December 2024 medical opinion from Dr. B.T., he opined that the Veteran's migraines prevent him from meeting the demands of employment.  Dr. B.T. stated that the Veteran's migraines limit his focus and concentration and slow him down at work resulting in missed days of work and frequent breaks, citing to the January 2012 VA examination.  The Veteran also reported that he needs naps during the day to relieve his migraine which is consistent with a finding that the Veteran's migraines "caus[e] extreme exhaustion, powerlessness, debilitation or incapacitation with substantial inability to engage in ordinary activities" to warrant a 50 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8100.  See VA Adjudication Manual, M21-1MR, Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, Section N, Topic 7, Block b.

The Board finds that the only probative evidence of record, including the January 2013 VA examination, the June 2016 DBQ and medical opinion completed by Dr. H.S., and the December 2024 medical opinion completed by Dr. B.T., persuasively demonstrates that the Veteran's migraines have been manifested with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Both Dr. H.S. and Dr. B.T. opined that the Veteran's migraines are debilitating, limiting his ability to concentrate and focus, and render him incapacitated which produces severe economic inadaptability.  Additionally, the evidence supports finding that the Veteran's headaches are "very frequent" and "prolonged" to warrant a 50 percent rating as he experiences debilitating headaches at least eight to 10 times per month.  Accordingly, entitlement to an initial increased rating of 50 percent for migraines is granted.   

The Board notes that the Veteran is now in receipt of a 50 percent rating for his migraines, which is the highest schedular rating available under Diagnostic Code 8100.

5. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for rhinitis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to compensable rating for his service-connected rhinitis.  

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a noncompensable rating for allergic rhinitis pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.  Under Diagnostic Code 6522, a 10 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

Evidence relevant to the severity of the Veteran's service-connected allergic rhinitis includes VA examinations.  

The Veteran was initially afforded a VA examination in May 2013.  He was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and reported nasal obstruction greater in the left than the right.  The examiner determined that the Veteran did not have obstruction greater than 50 percent in the nasal passage of both sides due to rhinitis, obstruction on the left or right sides due to rhinitis, permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, nasal polyps, or any other granulomatous conditions. 

He was again afforded a VA examination in May 2018.  He was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis.  The examiner determined that the Veteran did not have obstruction greater than 50 percent in the nasal passage of both sides due to rhinitis, obstruction on the left or right sides due to rhinitis, permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, nasal polyps, or any other granulomatous conditions. 

During an October 2021 VA examination, the Veteran was again diagnosed with allergic rhinitis.  He reported symptoms of nasal congestion, runny nose, and nose bleeds.  However, the examiner determined that there was no evidence of obstruction greater than 50 percent in the nasal passage of both sides due to rhinitis, obstruction on the left or right sides due to rhinitis, permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, nasal polyps, or any other granulomatous conditions. 

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran is entitled to a compensable rating for his allergic rhinitis.  To receive a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis under Diagnostic Code 6522, the record must reflect that the Veteran has allergic rhinitis without polyps with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  Here, the competent medical evidence does not indicate obstruction of the nasal passages greater than 50 percent on both sides, complete obstruction on one side, permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, nasal polyps, or any granulomatous conditions.  Accordingly, a compensable rating is not warranted pursuant to Diagnostic Code 6522.

The Board has considered the Veteran's reports of nasal obstruction, congestion, runny nose, and nose bleeds; however, the Board notes that, while the Veteran is competent to report any nasal symptoms he has had, he is not competent to report the percentage of obstruction in his nasal passages, as that requires medical expertise to diagnose and measure.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The Board finds that the objective medical findings by skilled professionals, which incorporate any reported symptoms and treatment, provide the most persuasive evidence regarding the level of severity of the Veteran's allergic rhinitis, and outweigh the Veteran's assertion.  As such, the Board finds the severity of the Veteran's overall disability does not warrant a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 6522.

The Board has also considered whether other diagnostic codes are applicable to this issue.  However, the Veteran has been diagnosed with and is in receipt of service connection for, allergic rhinitis, a condition that is specifically listed in the Rating Schedule.  Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015) ("[W]hen a condition is specifically listed in the Schedule, it may not be rated by analogy.")  Moreover, the Veteran is also service connected for residuals of fractured nose under Diagnostic Codes 5299-6502.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis is appropriately rated under Diagnostic Code 6522.

In sum, the Board finds that a higher rating for allergic rhinitis is not warranted.  Accordingly, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply, and the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

6. Entitlement to an initial increased rating in excess of 50 percent for sleep apnea

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased rating for his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea.

His obstructive sleep apnea is rated 50 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6847.  Under Diagnostic Code 6847, a 100 percent rating for sleep apnea is warranted when there is chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, or when the condition requires a tracheostomy.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97. 

In a June 2016 DBQ completed by Dr. H.S., it was determined that the Veteran had a diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnea that requires the use of a breathing assistance device such as a CPAP.  Other associated symptoms include persistent daytime hypersomnolence and sleep paralysis.  However, there was no evidence that the Veteran experiences chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention, cor pulmonale, and has required a tracheotomy.  

The Board has reviewed the Veteran's private treatment records, including a December 2024 medical opinion from Dr. B.T., and VA treatment records during the review period.  While the evidence shows that the Veteran has a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea that causes daytime hypersomnolence and sleep paralysis, requiring the use of a CPAP machine at night, and necessitates naps throughout the day due to debilitating fatigue, there is no evidence that his obstructive sleep apnea is manifested by respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, or that the Veteran has received a tracheotomy to warrant a 100 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6847.  

Based on review of all the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that throughout the review period, the Veteran's sleep apnea does not warrant a higher 100 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6847.  In this regard, the medical evidence does not show, and the Veteran does not allege, that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea results in respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, or that he has undergone a tracheostomy.  Because the Veteran's sleep apnea requires, at most, the use of a CPAP machine, the Board finds that it is no more than 50 percent disabling.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6847.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay assertions regarding the severity of his condition but finds them to be of limited probative value in adjudicating the rating for his OSA, as the rating criteria are based on mechanical medical findings, as opposed to subjective symptoms.

Accordingly, the Board finds that entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for obstructive sleep apnea is not warranted at any time during the review period.  The evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea.  Therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

7. Entitlement to a TDIU from May 29, 2012

A claim for a TDIU is part of an increased rating claim when such a claim is raised by the record.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  Here, the Veteran explicitly contended that he is entitled to a TDIU beginning May 29, 2012, as his obstructive sleep apnea and migraines preclude the Veteran from sustaining substantially gainful employment.  See Third Party Correspondence, May 2012.  As the record now raises a question of whether the Veteran is unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities, a claim for a TDIU is properly before the Board.

A total disability rating may be assigned when the schedular rating is less than 100 percent where a Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, that disability is rated 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability rated 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  

In determining whether a Veteran is unemployable for VA purposes, consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to age or any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Hersey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 91 (1992); Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000).  A Veteran need not show 100 percent unemployability in order to be entitled to a TDIU.  Robertson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  

Additionally, in Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019) the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), offered guidance in defining "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation."  The Court found that 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) has two components: one economic and one noneconomic.  The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  The non-economic component includes consideration of the following: the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the Veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.

From May 29, 2012, the Veteran has established service connection for sleep apnea rated as 50 percent disabling; migraines rated as 50 percent disabling; conjunctivitis rated as 10 percent disabling; tinnitus rated as 10 percent disabling; and lumbar spine arthritis, residuals of fractured nose, bilateral defective hearing, rhinitis, pterygium, and right foot dermatitis each rated as noncompensable.  The Veteran's combined rating for compensation purposes was 80 percent effective May 29, 2012.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.25, 4.26.  Therefore, the Veteran met the schedular rating criteria for TDIU.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).  

The remaining inquiry is whether he was unable to secure or follow substantially gainful occupation due solely to service-connected disabilities.  

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran last worked in February 2010 as a utility system repair operator.  See VA Form 21-4192, July 2021. 

A June 2016 medical opinion from Dr. H.S. asserted that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea and migraines are debilitating preventing him from sustaining gainful work.  Dr. H.S. stated that the Veteran experiences severe obstructive sleep apnea symptoms including daytime sleepiness and fatigue that result in naps for one to two hours per day.  As for the Veteran's migraines, Dr. H.S. determined that the Veteran experiences debilitating migraines approximately eight to 10 times per month where he has to lie down in a dark room for several hours at a time.  Due to the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea and migraines, Dr. H.S. stated that the Veteran needs to nap two to three hours per day and he experiences decreased focus and concentration which inhibit him from seeking or maintaining gainful employment.  

The Veteran also provided a December 2024 medical opinion completed by Dr. B.T. as to whether the Veteran is unable to maintain employment due to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and migraines.  Dr. B.T. noted that the Veteran reported difficulty with fatigue while working and reportedly dozed off.  Dr. B.T. stated that the Veteran continues to struggle with constant fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and frequent migraines all of which impact his sleep, his focus, and his ability to complete tasks in a timely manner.  Dr. B.T. also noted that the Veteran needs naps during the day due to fatigue and to relieve his migraines.  Based on the Veteran's medical history included in the claims file, Dr. B.T. opined that due to the Veteran's limitations associated with his obstructive sleep apnea and migraine headaches, he has difficulty concentrating and staying focused.  Dr. B.T. further opined that these conditions would require the Veteran to miss work or leave early three or more days per month.  Additionally, the Veteran would need more than one additional break per day aside from normally scheduled morning, lunch, and afternoon breaks so he could lie down, recline, or stretch.  Also, for more than three days per month, the Veteran would not be able to stay focused for at least seven hours of an eight-hour day due to fatigue, frequent migraines, and extra unscheduled breaks.  All of these issues are inconsistent with an ability to sustain employment.  Therefore, the Veteran's service-connected conditions would prevent him from meeting any of the demands of employment.  At the conclusion of his report, Dr. B.T. stated that after considering the effects of the Veteran's service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and migraines alone, he has been unable to maintain substantially gainful employment as a result of the service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and migraines since at least May 29, 2012.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively favors finding that the Veteran's service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and migraines rendered him unemployable since at least May 29, 2012.  Both Dr. H.S. and Dr. B.T. offered adequate and highly probative opinions based on an accurate medical history and each provided explanations that contained clear conclusions with supporting data when opining that the Veteran was unemployable due to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and migraines.  See Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  The evidence supports finding that the Veteran was both mentally and physical unable to complete the necessary tasks of employment due to the debilitating symptoms of his obstructive sleep apnea and migraines.  These conditions resulted in decreased focus and concentration and extreme fatigue making it difficult, if not impossible, to complete any employment related tasks.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran has been unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and migraines since at least May 29, 2012.  Accordingly, entitlement to a TDIU from May 29, 2012, is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  

8. Entitlement to SMC on a statutory housebound basis from August 1, 2014

As the Veteran has been granted a 100 percent rating for a single service-connected disability, the VA must consider whether an award of SMC is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).  

SMC is payable at a specified rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) when a Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and: (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or, (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  

For the purpose of meeting the first criterion, a rating of 100 percent may be based on any of the following grants of total disability: on a schedular basis, on an extraschedular basis, or on the basis of a temporary total rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.28 (pre-stabilization rating), 4.29 (temporary total hospital rating) or, 4.30 (temporary total convalescence rating).  Additionally, a TDIU may meet the criterion, but only if assigned for a single disability.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008); Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2011).  While the separate disabilities rated as 60 percent disabling must involve separate and distinct anatomical segments or body systems, the fact that the total disability and the independent 60 percent disabilities result from a common etiological agent will not preclude entitlement.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  

With regard to the permanently housebound requirement, the requirements are where a Veteran is substantially confined as a direct result of a service-connected disability to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinic areas, and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resulting confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime.  Id.

Here, the Veteran is now in receipt of a 100 percent rating for his service-connected depressive disorder with anxiety effective August 1, 2014, which meets the requirement for a single service-connected disability rated as equivalent to 100 percent.  As for his other service-connected disabilities, from August 1, 2014, the Veteran established service connection for obstructive sleep apnea rated as 50 percent disabling, migraine headaches rated as 50 percent disabling, conjunctivitis rated as 10 percent disabling, tinnitus rated as 10 percent disabling, peripheral vestibular disorder rated as 10 percent disabling, and lumbar spine arthritis, pterygium, residuals fractured nose, bilateral defective hearing, rhinitis, right foot dermatitis, and hypertension each rated as non-disabling.  The combined evaluation for the Veteran's remaining disabilities is 80 percent.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.25, 4.26.  Consequently, the Board finds that the Veteran meets the requirements for SMC at the housebound rate from August 1, 2014.  Accordingly, entitlement to SMC on a statutory housebound basis from August 1, 2014, is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).
