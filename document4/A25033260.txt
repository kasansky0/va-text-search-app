ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right hip limitation of flexion is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right hip limitation of extension is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left hip limitation of extension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The weight of the most persuasive evidence is against finding that the Veteran's right hip flexion is more nearly manifested by flexion limited to 45 degrees or less.

2. The Veteran's right hip limitation of extension is not more nearly manifested by extension limited to 5 degrees or less.

3. The Veteran's left hip limitation of extension is not more nearly manifested by extension limited to 5 degrees or less.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable rating for right hip limitation of flexion have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252.

2. The criteria for a compensable rating for right hip limitation of extension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5251.

3. The criteria for a compensable rating for left hip limitation of extension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5251.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2018 to September 2022.

In a November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ, in relevant part, granted service connection for the following: service connection for right hip limitation of flexion and assigned a non-compensable rating, effective December 14, 2022; service connection for left hip limitation of extension and assigned a non-compensable rating, effective December 14, 2022; and service connection for right hip limitation of extension and assigned a non-compensable rating, effective December 14, 2022.  The Veteran subsequently appealed the ratings assigned.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that the Veteran is also service connected for right hip strain at 10 percent, effective December 14, 2022; and left hip strain at noncompensable, effective January 28, 2023.

1. Entitlement to a compensable rating for right hip limitation of flexion.

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for his right hip limitation of flexion.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The percentages are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of service-connected disability, and separate Diagnostic Codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In rating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, it is necessary to consider, along with the schedular criteria, functional loss due to flare-ups of pain, fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, and weakness.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  The functional loss may be due to absence of part, or all, of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated innervation, or other pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.40.  Pain on movement, swelling, deformity, or atrophy of disuse as well as instability of station, disturbance of locomotion, interference with sitting, standing, and weight bearing are relevant considerations for determination of joint disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45.  Painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, are entitled to at least the minimal compensable rating for the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59; Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 applies to disabilities other than arthritis).  However, painful motion alone is not a functional loss without some restriction of the normal working movements of the body. Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 43 (2011) some restriction of the normal working movements of the body.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 43 (2011).

The Veteran's right hip flexion is rated under Diagnostic Code 5252.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252, a 10 percent disability rating is assigned for flexion of the thigh limited to 45 degrees; a 20 percent rating is warranted when there is limitation of flexion to 30 degrees; a 30 percent rating is warranted for limitation of thigh flexion to 20 degrees, and a 40 percent rating is warranted for limitation of thigh flexion to 10 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252.

Normal range of motion for the hip is flexion from zero to 125 degrees, and abduction from zero to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

In January 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess his right hip flexion.  The Veteran denied flare-ups of his right hip.  The Veteran reported having functional loss or impairment described as "increased walking or standing for prolonged periods of time increases discomfort."

Initial range of motion testing revealed flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, external rotation to 20 degrees, internal rotation to 20 degrees; the examiner indicated that adduction was not preclusive of crossing the legs.  There was evidence of pain on weight-bearing, active motion, non-weight-bearing, passive motion that causes functional loss.  There was no objective evidence of crepitus or objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue.  The examiner noted the Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions.  The Veteran was not examined after repeated use over time.  The examiner procured evidence suggesting pain, weakness, and lack of endurance which significantly limits functional ability with repeated use over time.  The estimated range of motion in degrees for the right hip immediately after repeated use over time based on information procured from relevant sources including the lay statements of the Veteran was the following: flexion to 50 degrees, external rotation to 10 degrees, and internal rotation to 10 degrees.  There were no additional contributing factors to the Veteran's right hip.  There was no muscle atrophy in either hip.  The Veteran does not require the use of any assistive device as a normal mode of locomotion.

In July 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess his right hip flexion.  The Veteran denied flare-ups of his right hip or left hip or thigh.  

Initial range of motion testing revealed flexion to 120 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, external rotation to 60 degrees, and internal rotation to 40 degrees; the examiner indicated that adduction was not preclusive of crossing the legs.  Pain was noted on external and internal rotation.  The examiner noted evidence of active motion, passive motion, that does not result in/cause functional loss.  There is no objective evidence of crepitus, or objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue.  Repetitive-use testing was performed with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions.  There was no muscle atrophy in either hip.  The Veteran does not require the use of any assistive device as a normal mode of locomotion.

The Board thus finds that the measurements contained in the January 2023 and July 2023 VA examinations comply with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45.  The record does not indicate that the Veteran has any symptoms related to the right hip that is not contemplated by the Diagnostic Code discussed in this decision, including any functional impairment due to pain or other symptoms indicated by 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45.  The Board thus finds that the record does not support the assignment of a compensable rating for limitation of flexion of the right hip.  The Veteran's right hip did not approach the limitation of 45 degrees of flexion that is required for a compensable rating.  

Given the above, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for right hip limitation of flexion. A s the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to a compensable rating for right hip limitation of extension. 

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for right hip limitation of extension.  The Board's review of the record does not support such a contention.

The Veteran has been assigned a non-compensable rating for right hip extension under Diagnostic Code 5251.

Diagnostic Code 5251 contemplates limitation of extension of the thigh or hip.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for extension limited to 5 degrees.  This is the highest rating available under Diagnostic Code 5251.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code Diagnostic Code 5251.

On examination in January 2023, the Veteran demonstrated, at worst, right hip/thigh extension to 20 degrees.  The Veteran denied flare-ups in the right and left hip.  Pain was noted on weight-bearing, non-weight-bearing, passive motion, active motion, that causes functional loss described as increases discomfort precipitated by increased walking or standing for prolonged periods of time.  The examiner noted the Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions.  The Veteran was not examined after repeated use over time.  The examiner procured evidence suggesting pain, weakness, and lack of endurance which significantly limits functional ability with repeated use over time.  The estimated range of motion in degrees for the right hip immediately after repeated use over time based on information procured from relevant sources including the lay statements of the Veteran is extension to 10 degrees.  Clinical examination revealed no atrophy; ankylosis; malunion or nonunion of femur, flail hip joint or leg length; or scars.

On examination in July 2023, the Veteran demonstrated, at worst, right hip/thigh extension to 25 degrees.  The Veteran denied flare-ups in the right and left hip.  Pain was not noted on extension.  The Veteran demonstrated pain with active motion, and passive motion that did not result in /cause functional loss.  There was not objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue or crepitus.  Clinical examination revealed no atrophy; ankylosis; malunion or nonunion of femur, flail hip joint or leg length; or scars.

Where there is extension of the hip/thigh limited to 5 degrees, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5251.  As such, a 10 percent disability rating is not warranted for right hip limitation of extension.  Because the Veteran has range of extension of the beyond 5 degrees and pain on motion of the thighs is already contemplated in the ratings for bilateral thigh impairment (Diagnostic Code 5253), a maximum, 10 percent rating for bilateral thigh extension is not warranted.

On balance, the weight of the evidence is against the claim for increase.

Given the above, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for bilateral hip limitation of extension.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

3. Entitlement to a compensable rating for left hip limitation of extension.

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for left hip limitation of extension.  The Board's review of the record does not support such a contention.

The Veteran has been assigned a non-compensable rating for left hip extension under Diagnostic Code 5251.

Diagnostic Code 5251 contemplates limitation of extension of the thigh or hip.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for extension limited to 5 degrees.  This is the highest rating available under Diagnostic Code 5251.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code Diagnostic Code 5251.  

On examination in January 2023, the Veteran demonstrated, at worst, left hip/thigh extension to 20 degrees.  The Veteran denied flare-ups in the right and left hip.  Pain was noted on weight-bearing, non-weight-bearing, passive motion, active motion, that causes functional loss described as increases discomfort precipitated by increased walking or standing for prolonged periods of time.  The examiner noted the Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions.  The Veteran was not examined after repeated use over time.  The examiner procured evidence suggesting pain, weakness, and lack of endurance which significantly limits functional ability with repeated use over time.  The estimated range of motion in degrees for the left hip immediately after repeated use over time based on information procured from relevant sources including the lay statements of the Veteran is extension to 10 degrees.  Clinical examination revealed no atrophy; ankylosis; malunion or nonunion of femur, flail hip joint or leg length; or scars.

On examination in July 2023, the Veteran demonstration, at worst, right hip/thigh extension to 25 degrees.  The Veteran denied flare-ups in the right and left hip.  Pain was not noted on extension.  There was no pain noted on range of motion.  The examiner noted no pain on examination, with no pain upon weightbearing, non-weightbearing, active, or passive motion in the left hip.  There was no objective evidence of crepitus, or objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue in the left hip.  Repetitive-use testing was performed with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions.  The Veteran denied flare-ups of the left hip.  There was no muscle atrophy in either hip.  The Veteran does not require the use of any assistive device as a normal mode of locomotion.

Where there is extension of the hip/thigh limited to 5 degrees, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5251.  The Board observes that the Veteran was noted as having extension limited to a maximum of 10 degrees.  Such ROM measurement does not meet the criteria for a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5251.  Because the Veteran has range of extension of the beyond 5 degrees, a maximum, 10 percent rating for bilateral thigh extension is not warranted.

On balance, the weight of the evidence is against the claim for increase.

Given the above, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for left hip limitation of extension.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v.
