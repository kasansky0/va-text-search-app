ORDER

An effective date prior to December 27, 2012, for the grant of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. In an August 1995 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for anxiety and panic attacks; the Veteran timely appealed the denial to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board); but before the case was certified to the Board on appeal, the Veteran submitted a November 1996 written request to withdraw the Board appeal.

2. In a December 1998 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for anxiety with panic disorder and mental problems because his claim was not well-grounded; the RO subsequently notified the Veteran of the determination, his appeal rights, and how to substantiate a well-grounded claim, in December 1998; the Veteran did not timely appeal the December 1998 rating decision or submit new and material evidence necessary to establish a well-grounded claim within one year of the December 1998 notice letter.

3. The next communication in the claims file indicating an intent to a file a claim (formal or informal) of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is the Veteran's December 27, 2012, VA Form 21-526b (legacy supplemental claim) seeking service connection for depression secondary to his service-connected foot condition.  

4. In an October 2022 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for PTSD and assigned an effective date of December 27, 2012, the date of the supplemental claim to reopen.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The August 1995 and December 1998 legacy rating decisions are final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105a; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 20.1100.

2.  The criteria for an effective date, prior to December 27, 2012, for the grant of service connection for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1979 to April 1983.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  In that rating decision, the RO denied an effective date prior to December 27, 2012, for the grant of service connection for PTSD.

In February 2024, the Board received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (notice of disagreement or NOD).  The Veteran selected the Direct Review docket.  Under the Direct Review docket, the Board's decision is based on the evidence of record at the time of the January 10, 2024, rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claim on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider in this decision, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, in a January 2025 brief, the Veteran's attorney appears to suggest that the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the Veteran's total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities is part of the instant appeal stream.  It is not.  Rather, it is the subject of a different appeal stream also pending at the Board under a different docket number.  The TDIU appeal will be addressed under separate cover in docket order at a later date.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 27, 2012, for the grant of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an effective date of July 24, 1995, for the grant of service connection for PTSD.  In support of this assertion, the Veteran's attorney, Matthew Hill, obtained a private medical opinion in December 2022 provided by Erik Levy, a licensed psychologist.  According to Dr. Levy, the Veteran has suffered from PTSD since at least 1995.  Additionally, in a March 2022 Brief entitled Memorandum of Law, the Veteran's attorney argued that an earlier effective date back to 1995 is warranted for the grant of service connection for PTSD asserting that the August 1995 rating decision denying the claim never became final.  The attorney claimed that after the Veteran timely appealed the August 1995 rating decision to the Board in the legacy review system, the case was never certified to the Board, and as such, the appeal remained pending.  Notably, however, in a subsequent, January 2025 brief, the attorney acknowledged that the Veteran indeed withdrew his appeal in November 1996.  Nevertheless, neither the Veteran nor Mr. Hill has provided any additional argument in support of the appeal for an effective date prior to December 27, 2012, for the grant of service connection for PTSD. 

For the reasons explained below, entitlement to an effective date prior to December 27, 2012, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is not warranted.

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim or a claim reopened after final adjudication "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The implementing regulation clarifies this to mean that the effective date of service connection and compensation based on an original claim or a reopened claim will be the "[d]ate of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

If a claim for disability compensation is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of entitlement is the day following separation or the date entitlement arose.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

According to the law in effect prior to March 24, 2015 (the effective date of the current regulations), a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.151. A "claim" was defined broadly to include any formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p) (2014).  Any communication indicating intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). If received within 1 year from the date it was sent to the claimant, the formal claim will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a).  To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications that may be construed as an application or claim. Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).  

Beginning on March 24, 2015, all claims must be submitted on specific forms prescribed by the Secretary.  In the legacy review system, a rating decision becomes final after one year of notice of that determination unless the Veteran perfects an appeal pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §19.52; or files a notice of disagreement during the one-year appeal period that is subsequently perfected; or until any new and material evidence received during the one-year appeal period is addressed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.  If a claim is finally denied and later reopened and granted based on the submission of new and material evidence, the effective date of benefits will be the date the claimant filed the application to reopen or the date that entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2).

Turning to the facts, the RO denied the Veteran's initial claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder (claimed as anxiety and panic attacks) in an August 1995 rating decision.  The RO subsequently issued a September 1995 statement of the case (SOC), and the Veteran filed a VA Form 9 substantive appeal to the Board in December 1995.  Before the appeal was certified to the Board, the Veteran, in November 1996 correspondence, requested to withdraw the appeal of service connection anxiety and panic attacks.  The August 1995 rating decision became final at the time of the withdrawal of appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400; 19.55.

In August 1998, the Veteran submitted a new claim of service connection for anxiety and panic disorder.  In a December 1998 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for anxiety with panic disorder and mental problems because his claim was not well-grounded.  The RO subsequently notified the Veteran of the determination, his appeal rights, and how to substantiate a well-grounded claim, in December 1998; however, the Veteran did not timely appeal the December 1998 rating decision or submit new and material evidence necessary to establish a well-grounded claim within one year of the December 1998 notice letter.  Accordingly, the December 1998 rating decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400; 19.52.

The next communication indicating an intent to apply for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder was received on December 27, 2012, when VA received the Veteran's supplemental claim to reopen the previously denied claim of service connection for panic, anxiety; and also, the Veteran claimed service connection for PTSD, as well as a claim of service connection for depression, believed to be due to his service-connected foot disability.  The Veteran subsequently submitted a PTSD stressor statement, and reported that he receives mental health treatment from VA mental health clinic.

After development, the claim for service connection for PTSD was granted in an October 2022 rating decision.  That rating decision assigned an effective date on December 27, 2012, the date of receipt of the supplemental claim to reopen.

The Veteran filed a supplemental claim in January 2023, seeking an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD, back to July 1995.

In the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the RO denied an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD, because the date of the claim to reopen was December 27, 2012.

While the December 2022 private opinion asserts that the Veteran had a diagnosis or symptoms of PTSD back to 1995, that argument is not dispositive of the claim because the law is clear, that the effective date based on a claim to reopen a previously denied claim, in the legacy review system, is the later of the date of the claim to reopen, and the date entitlement arose.  

As noted above, the Veteran perfected an appeal to the Board following an August 1995 rating decision, but later withdrew that appeal before it was certified to the Board.  Likewise, the Veteran's August 1998 claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder was denied in an unappealed December 1998 rating decision.  For the reasons set forth above, the August 1995 and December 1998 rating decisions became final.  The Veteran's assertion that he had symptoms of an acquired psychiatric disorder in 1995 does not vitiate the finality of the August 1995 or the December 1998 rating decisions.  As there was no claim, formal or informal, filed between the December 1998 denial of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and the December 27, 2012 claim to reopen the finally denied claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date prior to December 27, 2012 for the grant of service connection for PTSD.  38 U.S.C. § 5101; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155 (2014).  Moreover, the Veteran's argument that his effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD should coincide with symptoms that were present in 1995, is essentially an assertion that entitlement to service connection for PTSD arose in 1995.  However, even assuming that entitlement arose in 1995, the claim to reopen is December 27, 2012 which is the later of the date entitlement arose and the date of the claim to reopen.  Accordingly, an effective date prior to December 27, 2012, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; 3.400(q)(2), (r).
