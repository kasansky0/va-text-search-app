ORDER

The overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation in the amount of $342.00 created by the retroactive termination of payment of additional compensation for M. effective June 1, 2023, is not valid; the appeal is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was awarded additional compensation benefits for his spouse, M., effective April 1, 2014.

2. On May 18, 2023, VA received a VA Form 21-686c, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, on which it was reported that the Veteran and M. had divorced on May 18, 2023; however, that form is not signed by the Veteran, and he later clarified that there was no final divorce judgment.

3.  In a July 2023 letter, VA advised the Veteran that M. payment of additional compensation for M. had been terminated effective June 1, 2023; this action resulted in an overpayment totaling $342.00. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The retroactive termination of payment of additional compensation for M. effective June 1, 2023, was not proper and the resulting debt in the amount of $342.00 is not valid.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 5111, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.205, 3.401, 3.501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from September 1997 to June 2000.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which determined that the retroactive termination of payment of additional compensation for the Veteran's spouse, M., effective June 1, 2023, the first day of the month following their (purported) divorce on May 18, 2023, was proper.  This retroactive termination resulted in an overpayment in the amount of $342.00.  

In October 2023, the Veteran, through his attorney, Robert V. Chisholm, submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), on which he identified the August 2023 HLR rating decision, the issue as "Validity of the debt from the removal of dependent spouse [M.] from the Veteran's award," and elected the Direct Review docket.  

By way of history, in a July 2023 decision, the RO terminated payment of additional compensation for the Veteran's spouse, M., effective June 1, 2023, the first day of the month following their purported divorce on May 18, 2023.  This action resulted in an overpayment in the amount of $342.00.  

In August 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request:  Higher Level Review, on which he identified the July 2023 decision and the issue as "removal of veterans spouse."  

In the August 2023 HLR rating decision, the RO determined that the retroactive termination of payment of additional compensation for M. effective June 1, 2023 was proper.  As set forth above, in October 2023, the Veteran appealed this decision via his submission of a VA Form 10182 on which he elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Whether the retroactive termination of payment of additional compensation for the Veteran's former spouse, M., effective June 1, 2023, and resulting overpayment in the amount of $342, was proper.

An overpayment is created when VA determines that a beneficiary or payee has received monetary benefits to which he or she is not entitled.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5302; 38 C.F.R. § 1.962.  An overpayment may arise from virtually any benefits program administered pursuant to VA law, including pension, compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, educational assistance benefits and subsistence allowance, insurance benefits, burial and plot allowances, clothing allowance, and automobile or other conveyance and adaptive equipment allowances.  See 38 C.F.R. § 1.956(a).

In order for the Board to determine whether the overpayment was created properly, it must be established that the Veteran was not entitled legally to the benefits in question, and if there was no legal entitlement, it must then be shown that VA was not solely responsible for the Veteran being paid benefits erroneously.  

An additional amount of compensation may be payable for a spouse where a veteran is entitled to compensation based on disability evaluated as 30 percent or more disabling. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4 (b)(2).  The record on appeal reflects that in a May 2004 rating decision, the RO assigned a disability rating at the 30 percent level, effective June 21, 2000.  The Veteran has been rated at least 30 percent since that time.  

In July 2016, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c, Declaration of Status of Dependents, on which he reported that he and M. had married in November 2011.  

In a July 2017 letter, the RO notified the Veteran that his monthly compensation included payment of an additional amount for his spouse, M., effective April 1, 2014.  The Veteran was provided with a VA Form 21-8764 which explained his obligation to notify the RO of any changes in his dependency status and the consequences of failing to do so.

The record contains a VA Form 21-686c, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, received on May 18, 2023, which indicates that the Veteran and M. divorced on May 18, 2023.  This form was not signed by the Veteran.  

In a July 2023 letter, the RO notified the Veteran that payment of additional compensation for M. had been terminated effective June 1, 2023, the first day of the month following their purported divorce.  In an August 2023, the Veteran was notified by VA's Debt Management Center (DMC) that he owed a debt of $342.00.  

As set forth above, in this appeal, the Veteran has challenged the validity of the $342 debt created from the retroactive termination of payment of additional compensation for M.  

In an August 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the Veteran contended that on May 18, 2023, he called VA and requested that his spouse be taken off of his compensation award since their divorce was pending and he did not want an overpayment to accrue.  He contends that he explained to the VA representative that he was not divorced yet; however, he did not want his spouse on his benefits any longer, and for whatever reason, the representative put the date of the call as the date of divorce.  He indicated that the State of Florida requires divorcing parties to attend mediation prior to divorce.  He said that he and his spouse attended mediation on July 31, 2023 and a judge was currently reviewing the matter, but no final judgement had, as of yet, been entered.

The August 2023 Higher Level Review decision determined that the retroactive removal of the Veteran's spouse M., from his VA compensation award which resulted in an overpayment in the amount of $342.00 was valid.  The Veteran's attorney has asserted that the Veteran notified VA in advance of his divorce, but has provided no other argument or contentions.

Proof of divorce is addressed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.206.  Under that provision, the validity of a divorce decree regular on its face, will be questioned by the Department of Veterans Affairs only when such validity is put in issue by a party thereto or a person whose interest in a claim for Department of Veterans Affairs benefits would be affected thereby.  In this case, there is no divorce decree.   

VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual M21-1 (M21-1), however, provides additional guidance.  Specifically, the M21-1 explains that "[d]ocumentary evidence of the termination of prior marriages is not routinely required."  M21-1, VII.i.2.A.4.b; see Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018) (while the Board is not bound by the M21-1, it is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases for its decisions).  Rather, the M21-1 provides that 

VA accepts the entries a claimant makes on a completed and signed VA Form 21-686c (or other prescribed form listed in the last row of the table in M21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 1.A.1.a) as proof of termination of a marriage in the absence of contradictory evidence of record (to include entries the claimant makes on the form) that cannot be resolved through reconciliation with other evidence of record, or telephone contact with the claimant.

Id.  

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5112(b)(2), the effective date of reduction or discontinuance of compensation by reason of divorce of a dependent of a payee shall be the last day of the month in which such divorce occurs.  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.501(d)(2).  

In this case, the Board finds that the May 2023 VA Form 686c was not adequate proof of termination of marriage, as it was not completed and signed by the Veteran.  Moreover, the Veteran's contentions make clear that his divorce from M. did not occur in May 2023.  Rather, he contends that May 18, 2023, was the date he telephoned VA.  He explained that, at that time, he and his spouse were not divorced.  

Therefore, June 1, 2023 is not the proper date for termination of payment of additional compensation for M. because there was no divorce.  Thus, the debt created from that removal was not proper and is not a valid debt.   The appeal is accordingly granted.
