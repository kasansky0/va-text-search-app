REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 2021 to August 2023.

This matter comes to the Board on appeal from rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) dated January 2024, April 2024, and May 2024. 

In the May 30, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

1. The appeal for an initial rating higher than 50 percent for PTSD is dismissed.

2. The appeal for an initial compensable rating for vitamin D deficiency is dismissed.

3. The appeal for an initial compensable rating for xerosis cutis is dismissed.

4. The appeal for an initial compensable rating for migraines is dismissed.

5. The appeal for service connection for a psychiatric disability other that PTSD is dismissed.

6. The appeal for service connection for bilateral tibia bone fractures is dismissed.

7. The appeal for service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome is dismissed.

8. The appeal for service connection for an eating disorder is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. A withdrawal must include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issues withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. §20.205(b)(1). 

In January 2025 correspondence, the Veteran wrote that she wished to withdraw all claims that were pending before the Board. That correspondence included her claims file number, her name, and was signed. The statement expressed a clear desire to withdraw the pending appeal in its entirety. Also, there are no other pending appeals to which the Veteran could have referred. Because the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal in its entirety, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
