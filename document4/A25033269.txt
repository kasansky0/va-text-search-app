ORDER

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1992 to January 2015.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 supplemental review decision that was issued following the Veteran's request for higher-level review of a March 2023 rating decision and the agency of original jurisdiction's (AOJ's) identification of a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2502.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 supplemental review decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the January 2024 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

1. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea 

The Veteran asserts that his sleep apnea is due to his service. Specifically, he stated that "the condition began in the military" and he would experience "nausea, headaches, snoring and stopped breathing during the night." See March 2023 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). Alternatively, the Veteran contends that his sleep apnea is secondary to his service-connected PTSD. See April 2023 Correspondence. Following review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence addressing whether the Veteran's current sleep apnea had its onset during service is at least in approximate balance, such that service connection may be granted.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is to be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the claim is to be denied. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran underwent a sleep study in April 2016 which indicated he had moderately severe obstructive sleep apnea. The study also documented that the Veteran's weight was 200 pounds and his BMI was 28.7. The clinician recommended "weight reduction should be aggressively pursued." See April 21, 2016 VA Treatment Record. The Board notes the Veteran's weight at military entrance was 130 pounds. See June 1992 Enlistment Medical Examination.

In a March 2023 VA examination, the examiner confirmed a diagnosis of sleep apnea but concluded the condition was less likely than not caused by the Veteran's in-service toxic exposure risk activities. The examiner did not address the likely onset of the Veteran's sleep apnea. 

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in August 2023. That examiner also issued a negative opinion but only addressed whether the Veteran's sleep apnea was secondary to his service-connected PTSD. 

The evidence also contains a sleep apnea disability benefits questionnaire submitted by the Veteran and completed by a VA physician who has treated the Veteran's sleep apnea. See April 24, 2023 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) - Veteran Provided. The physician noted that the Veteran reported experiencing sleep problems since 2006, complained prior to leaving service, and was told he should undergo a sleep study at a VA facility. The physician further noted that the Veteran described morning headaches while on active duty that were likely related.

The Board finds the Veteran's report of sleep symptoms that began in service credible, given the timing of his separation from service and his initial diagnosis of sleep apnea in 2016, following a sleep study. Notably, the Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for this condition in November 2015, less than a year after his discharge. 

Moreover, the Board finds that the Veteran's description of in-service symptoms, coupled with his VA physician's diagnosis of sleep apnea and related discussion of the symptoms the Veteran was experiencing in service brings the evidence addressing whether his sleep apnea was incurred in service into approximate balance. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (explaining that lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when it is describing symptoms at the time that support a later diagnosis by a medical professional).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary is required to give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107. As a result, service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is warranted based on in-service incurrence, and the claim is granted.
