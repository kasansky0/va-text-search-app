ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral pes planus pre-existed service and was not aggravated thereby.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an award of service connection for bilateral pes planus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.306.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1973 to May 1974.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Service Connection

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

Every veteran who served in the active military, naval, or air service after December 31, 1946, is taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1137.  Only those conditions recorded in examination reports can be considered as "noted," 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b), and a history of preservice existence of conditions recorded at the time of examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b)(1).

To rebut the presumption of sound condition for conditions not noted at entrance into service, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service.  VAOPGCPREC 3-03 (July 16, 2003), 70 Fed. Reg. 23027 (May 4, 2005).  Concerning clear and unmistakable evidence that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service, the second step necessary to rebut the presumption of soundness, a lack of aggravation may be shown by establishing that there was no increase in disability during service or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the preexisting condition.  Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 U.S.C. § 1153.

If a disorder noted at the time of a veteran's examination, acceptance, and enrollment into service undergoes a chronic or permanent increase in severity during service, it is presumed that the disability was aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a).  This presumption can be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrating that the increase was due to the natural progress of the condition.  38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b).

Temporary or intermittent flare-ups during service of a preexisting injury or disease are not sufficient to be considered "aggravation in service" unless the underlying condition, as contrasted to symptoms, is worsened.  Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238, 247-48 (1994); Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1991).  A pre-existing disease or injury will be found to have been aggravated by service only if the evidence shows that the underlying disability underwent an increase in severity; the occurrence of symptoms, in the absence of an increase in the underlying severity, does not constitute aggravation of the disability.  Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a).

Evidence of the veteran being asymptomatic on entry into service, with an exacerbation of symptoms during service, does not constitute evidence of aggravation.  Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 320, 323 (1991).  If the disorder becomes worse during service and then improves due to in-service treatment to the point that it was no more disabling than it was at entrance into service, the disorder has not been aggravated by service.  Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529 (1996).  Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during and subsequent to service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b).

A layperson is generally incapable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge.  However, lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when: (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (e.g., a broken leg, separated shoulder, pes planus (flat feet), varicose veins, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), etc.), (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In essence, lay testimony is competent when it pertains to the readily observable features or symptoms of injury or illness and "may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection."  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2).  A determination as to whether medical evidence is needed to demonstrate that a veteran presently has the same condition he or she had in service or during a presumptive period, or whether lay evidence will suffice, depends on the nature of the veteran's present condition (e.g., whether the veteran's condition is of a type that requires medical expertise to identify it as the same condition as that in service or during a presumption period, or whether it can be so identified by lay observation).  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 310 (2007).

Thus, medical evidence is not always or categorically required when the determinative issue involves either medical diagnosis or etiology, but rather such issue may, depending on the facts of the particular case, be established by competent and credible lay evidence under 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  An approximate balance of the evidence includes, but is not limited to, equipoise.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Evidence is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Id.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus.

Initially, the Board notes the AOJ, in the April 2024 rating decision, made the following favorable findings: 1) the Veteran has a diagnosis of bilateral pes planus, plantar fasciitis, and calcaneal spurring, 2) participation in a toxic exposure is conceded based on confirmed toxic exposure, and 3) bilateral pes planus existed prior to military service based on service treatment records (STRs) showing bilateral pes planus on entrance exam.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  See AMA, Pub. L. No. 115-55, § 5104A, 131 Stat. 1105, 1106-07.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral flatfoot (pes planus).  See March 2024 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  Specifically, the Veteran states that when he entered service in 1973, he was not told that he had flat feet until 1974.  He stated that he was not treated until almost 40 years later.   See October 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

As noted, the Veteran's entrance examination shows mild bilateral pes planus.  See January 1973 enlistment examination.  As pes planus was "noted" at service entry, the presumption of soundness at entry into service does not attach, and service connection for pes planus may be granted only if it is shown that condition underwent a chronic or permanent worsening beyond natural progression during service (i.e., was aggravated by service).  38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306.  That is to say, this is a claim for aggravation.

The Veteran's July 1973 STR notes pain in the right foot at arch for about 1 year, diagnosed as tendonitis.  The December 1973 STR notes left foot pain secondary to trauma.  The Veteran's x-ray was negative and there was no swelling.  The Veteran was diagnosed with a bruise.  At the May 1974 separation examination, the Veteran checked "no" to foot trouble on the questionnaire.  

The Board notes that the February 2012 and January 2013 VA examiners' negative opinions were conclusory, as they lacked any reasoning or supporting rationale and thus are insufficient for adjudication purposes.

In an October 2023 statement, the Veteran stated that when he entered service in 1973, he was not told that he had flat feet until 1974.  He stated that he was not treated properly until almost 40 years later.  He stated he had one treatment at an outside private company.  He reported he was given shoes that made driving challenging.  See October 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2024 to assess the nature and likely etiology of his foot conditions.  See March 2024 C&P examination.  The March 2024 VA examiner opined that it is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the Veteran's right foot pes planus (which clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service) was aggravated beyond its natural progression by service.  The examiner acknowledged the Veteran's mild pes planus noted on the January 1973 enlistment examination and the Veteran's STRs.  In providing the opinion, the March 2024 clinician noted the July 2012 podiatry examination noted post tibial tendon dysfunction (PTD) with attenuation of tendons and plantar ligaments obesity.  The clinician discussed the fact that there is an increase of foot problems with increased weight and obesity.  It was noted that the Veteran was informed that treating flatfeet required significant weight loss and the documented treatment failure at his weight.  The clinician noted he was trying to initiate the needed exercise treatment and weight loss required to successfully treat his flatfeet deformity.  The examiner cited the relevant medical literature that flatfeet is a common condition, also known as flatfoot, in which the arches on the inside of the feet flatten when pressure is put on them.  When people with flatfeet stand up, the feet point outward, and the entire soles of the feet fall and touch the floor.  See https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flatfeet/symptoms-causes/syc-20372604.

The examiner reasoned that based on 

a review of the medical information provided, including all previous medical opinions related to the veteran's foot conditions, and the medical literature it is my medical opinion that it is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the veteran's right foot pes planus (which clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service) was aggravated beyond its natural progression by service.  It is my medical opinion that a positive opinion for direct service connection was given in error.  The veteran's efile shows clear evidence of bilateral pes planus on the enlistment exam dated January 11, 1973.  A service treatment record dated July 17, 1973 notes the veteran had been having right foot pain consistent with plantar fasciitis for 1 year at that time, indicating the veteran's right foot pain began around 6 months prior to service.  The veteran was treated for right foot pain, and the veteran denied any foot trouble on the separation exam dated May 10, 1974.  A review of the medical literature shows that 90% of plantar fasciitis will resolve with conservative treatment (American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, 2022), and there is no objective evidence to support persistence of the veteran's right foot symptoms after conservative therapy during service.  There is also no evidence to support worsening of the veteran's pes planus or related symptoms during service beyond what was reported to be present prior to service.  (March 2024 VA medical opinion).

The March 2024 clinician reasoned that there is consistent documentation by various podiatrists in the Veteran's electronic file that the Veteran's post-service development of obesity is a significant factor for worsening of the Veteran's right foot conditions.  She reasoned that based on the evidence in the Veteran's electronic file and the medical literature, aggravation or progression of the veteran's right foot conditions due to service cannot be established.  

Additionally, the examiner reasoned that the evidence is clear that the Veteran had a diagnosis of obesity after service, which is a primary risk factor for development and worsening of pes planus and plantar fasciitis with secondary calcaneal spurs.  There is consistent documentation by various podiatrists in the Veteran's electronic file that the Veteran's post-service development of obesity is a significant factor for worsening of the Veteran's right foot conditions.  She concluded that based on the evidence in the Veteran's electronic file and the medical literature, aggravation or progression of the Veteran's right foot conditions due to service cannot be established, therefore supporting the less likely than not opinion.

Additionally, while the March 2024 examiner opined that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis is at least as likely as not the result of the Veteran's pes planus, the Board notes that the Veteran is not service connection for pes planus.   

The Board acknowledges that the January 2024 examiner opined that the right foot (diagnosed as pes planus, calcaneal spurring and plantar fasciitis) condition is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event or illness.  The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's wearing of boots in service ultimately resulted in pes planus.  However, the Board notes that the examiner's opinion is based on an inaccurate factual premise.  The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's separation examination noted mild pes planus, and that diagnosis/onset was 1974.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's entrance and STRs are silent for any complaints regarding his claimed condition.  The opinion is based on the inaccurate factual premise that the Veteran's pes planus was incurred in service and does not acknowledge that pes planus was noted on entry and therefore a pre-existing disability.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise is not probative); Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2012) (per curiam) (if an opinion "is based on an inaccurate factual premise, then it is correct to discount it entirely.").

Inasmuch as the March 2024 examiner's opinion was based on an accurate understanding of the facts and articulates reasons for the conclusion reached, the Board finds the opinion highly probative.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).  Additionally, the March 2024 VA examiner addressed the multiple opinions with conflicting evidence.

Therefore, given the reasons above, the Board finds that the most probative opinion of record is the March 2024 opinion, as it is clear that the examiner considered all of the pertinent evidence of record, to include the Veteran's statements and his relevant medical history, and provided a rationale, relying on and citing to the records reviewed.  Moreover, the examiner offered clear conclusions with supporting data as well as reasoned medical explanations connecting the two.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes to the probative value of a medical opinion); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A]medical opinion... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").  

The Board has considered the lay statements of record.  However, there is nothing in the record to establish that the Veteran has the specialized training or experience necessary to render a competent opinion with respect to medically complex matters relating to the etiology of a foot disorder as it relates to its normal course and progression.  As such, the opinions in that regard cannot be afforded any probative weight.  See, e.g., Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral pes planus, which pre-existed service, was not aggravated by service.  The appeal is denied.
