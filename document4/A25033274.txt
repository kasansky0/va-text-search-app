ORDER

The appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

On May 14, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service in the United States Army from June 2005 to February 2009. 

This matter is before the Board on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

Withdrawal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id. A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.205(b)(1).

In the present case, on May 14, 2024, VA received written notice from the Veteran that he wished to withdraw his appeal with docket number 240430-436455. The notice included the Veteran's full name, the applicable VA file number, and a clear statement that the Veteran no longer wanted to pursue the appeal. Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018). 

As such, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal in writing and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
