ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, for purposes of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC), is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran died in July 1992.

2. The Veteran's death certificate lists multiple trauma, open skull fracture, due to a motorcycle crash.

3. For VA purposes, the Veteran's actions at the time of the July 1992 motorcycle crash, specifically to include consuming alcohol in excess and driving, constitute willful misconduct.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1310, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.102, 3.301, 3.310, 3.312.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from December 1985 to July 1992.  For his service, he was awarded the Navy Sharpshooter Ribbon, Battle "E" Ribbon, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (Fourth Award), Letter of Commendation, Letter of Appreciation, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Navy Achievement Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Joint Meritorious Unit Award, National Defense Service Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon, and Navy Unit Commendation.  The Veteran's service ended with his death in July 1992.  In August 1992, the Commanding Officer of U.S. Naval Magazine, Subic Bay, stated that the Veteran "was one of the very finest sailors who served at the Naval Magazine.  His loss is tragic for this command and for the Navy."  The Board is grateful for the Veteran's service to our Nation.  The appellant has been established as the Veteran's surviving spouse.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an administrative decision issued in December 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  Although the appellant's contentions, which were submitted in conjunction with her September 2023 Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995), were previously addressed by the August 1996 Board decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) nonetheless proceeded to adjudicate the appellant's claim on the merits in its December 2023 administrative decision.  As such, the Board will not disturb the AOJ's implicit finding of new and relevant evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c) (under the AMA, the Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings).

In August 2024, the Veteran filed a timely Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and requested both the Direct Review docket and a Virtual Telehearing.  Following the Board's September 2024 Notice of Disagreement Clarification Letter, the appellant confirmed, in January 2025, her Direct Review docket selection.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 administrative decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the December 2023 administrative decision cannot be considered by the Board.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, for purposes of DIC.

The appellant contends that VA relied on witness reports of "smell of alcohol" but that no blood alcohol report was submitted or considered for the determination, by VA, that the Veteran's cause of death was due to his own willful misconduct.

A surviving spouse of a deceased veteran is entitled to receipt of DIC benefits upon the service-connected death of a veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 1310.

To establish service connection for the cause of death and thus entitlement to DIC benefits, the evidence must show that a service-connected disability was either the principal or contributory cause of death.  Id.; 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(a).

A service-connected disability will be considered the principal cause of death when the disability singly, or jointly with some other condition, was the immediate or underlying cause of death or was etiologically related to such cause.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(b).  A contributory cause of death is inherently one not related to the principal cause but which contributed substantially or materially to the cause of death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c)(1).

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Aggravation of a non-service-connected disease or injury by a service-connected disability may also be service-connected.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b).

No compensation may be paid if a disability is a result of a veteran's own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(b).

A veteran is entitled to a presumption that an injury incurred during active service was "incurred in the line of duty" and was not the result of his or her misconduct.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citing 38 U.S.C. § 105(a)).  This presumption may be rebutted if the government demonstrates that the in-service injury was caused by or resulted from willful misconduct or the abuse of alcohol or drugs.  Id.

"In the line of duty" means an injury or disease incurred or aggravated during a period of active military service unless such injury or disease was the result of a veteran's own willful misconduct.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(m).

"Willful misconduct" means an act involving conscious wrongdoing or known prohibited action.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n).  More specifically, willful misconduct involves deliberate or intentional wrongdoing with knowledge of, or wanton and reckless disregard of, its probable consequences; mere technical violations of police regulations or ordinances do not per se constitute willful misconduct; and willful misconduct is not determinative unless it is the proximate cause of injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n)(1), (2), (3).

The Board's determination that a disability is the result of willful misconduct is a finding of fact that must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  Thomas v. Nicholson, 423 F.3d 1279, 1284-85 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Daniels v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 348, 351 (1996).  Additionally, the element of knowledge of, or wanton or reckless disregard of, probable consequences must be specifically addressed.  Myore v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 498, 503-04 (1996).

For purposes of VA, if intoxication results proximately and immediately in disability or death, such disability or death is considered to be the result of the person's own willful misconduct.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(c)(2) ("If, in the drinking of a beverage to enjoy its intoxicating effects, intoxication results proximately and immediately in disability or death, the disability or death will be considered the result of the person's willful misconduct"); Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 41 (1994).

A review of the evidence shows that the Veteran's death resulted from multiple trauma, open skull fracture, sustained in a motorcycle accident that occurred at approximately 8:00 p.m. on the evening of July 4, 1992, which did not involve other motor vehicles.  The Veteran was the driver of the motorcycle involved when he lost control, slid into a concrete guard rail, and hit a metal post.

By way of background, the August 1992 Line of Duty Command Investigation found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Veteran was in the line of duty at the time of his motorcycle accident.  The appellant filed a claim for DIC benefits in August 1992.  In a January 1993 administrative decision, the AOJ found-based on witness testimony-that alcohol and speed were indicated as contributing to the Veteran's accident and death-and concluded that the Veteran's actions constituted willful misconduct.  The AOJ denied the appellant's DIC claim in February 1993.

The appellant filed a Notice of Disagreement in July 1993, and her appeal was certified to the Board in November 1993.  In October 1995, the Board remanded the appellant's claim, including for production of the Department of Defense Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) toxicology report, which had been noted in the preliminary statement prepared by the Department of the Navy in July 1992 (as part of the Line of Duty Command Investigation).

According to the August 1992 AFIP toxicology report, which was added to the Veteran's claims file in April 1996, specimens from the Veteran's bile, blood, stomach contents, kidney, liver, urine, lung, and vitreous fluid were collected, submitted to the AFIP, and received in good condition.  The Veteran's blood and vitreous fluid were examined for the presence of acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetone, 2-propanol, 1-propanol, t-butanol, 2-butanol, iso-butanol, and 1-butanol by headspace gas chromatography.  Trace acetaldehyde was found in the Veteran's blood, and none was found in his vitreous fluid.  The concentration of alcohol in his blood was found to be 160 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)-or, in other words, a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.16 percent; the concentration of ethanol in his vitreous fluid was found to be 200 mg/dL.

In April 1996, the AOJ issued a Supplemental Statement of the Case, wherein the AOJ determined that the August 1992 AFIP toxicology report showed a BAC of 0.16 percent at the time of the Veteran's death, which was considered above the level accepted as showing definite impairment of actions due to alcohol ingestion; as such, the Veteran's death continued to be ruled as the result of his own willful misconduct.

In an August 1996 Board decision-which included a description of the Line of Duty Command Investigation findings and a discussion of the Veteran's BAC based on the AFIP toxicology report-a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ), Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) found the Veteran's injuries were the result of his willful misconduct and did not occur in the line of duty.  As such, the Board denied the appellant's claim for DIC benefits.  (The Board herein incorporates, by reference, the description of the Line of Duty Command Investigation findings contained in the 1996 Board decision.)

Although the Board is sympathetic to the appellant's claim, it concludes that-with no evidence to suggest any defect in, or information that would challenge the authenticity of, the August 1992 AFIP toxicology report-for purposes of VA, the Veteran's act of driving while under the influence of alcohol constituted willful misconduct.  It must therefore deny the appellant's claim for DIC benefits.

As the AFIP toxicology report shows, the Veteran had alcohol in his system with a BAC of 0.16 percent at the time of his motorcycle accident.  Relevant to the Board's analysis, under Chapter 23 of the United States Code-which outlines the provisions for federal aid highway programs-a BAC of 0.08 percent is a per se violation of driving while intoxicated.  23 U.S.C. § 163(a).  At the time of the Veteran's motorcycle accident in July 1992, his BAC was twice that of the referenced, recognized legal limit; therefore, the Board finds that he was driving while intoxicated.  Further, the evidence (including the Line of Duty Command Investigation findings contained in the 1996 Board decision, which were incorporated by reference above) reflects that the Veteran willingly and knowingly consumed alcohol and chose to drive a motorcycle.  Additionally, the Board finds that the fact that the Veteran consumed alcohol in excess to such an extent that he attained a BAC of 0.16 percent and chose to operate a motor vehicle demonstrates a wanton disregard of the probability of its harmful consequences.  Considering these factors together, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's conduct constituted willful misconduct.

The Board further finds that such conduct was the proximate cause of the Veteran's death.  "Proximate cause" is defined as a "cause that directly produces an event and without which the event would not have occurred."  Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 173 (2010) (citing Black's Law Dictionary 213 (7th ed. 1999)).  The Veteran operated a motorcycle while under the influence of alcohol.  This action resulted in a natural and continuing sequence, unbroken by an intervening cause, which produced the accident.  Indeed, in the Line of Duty Command Investigation, it was found that the Veteran's accident was not contributed to by such factors as road surface, obstructions, mechanical condition of the motorcycle, or experience of the driver.  And, per the death certificate, no other motor vehicles were involved.  The Veteran's death certificate shows that he died from multiple traumatic injuries due to the accident.  The evidence thus demonstrates that the Veteran's willful misconduct was the proximate cause of his fatal injuries.

Therefore, the Board finds that, for VA purposes, the Veteran's death was the result of willful misconduct.  Consequently, although the Board is sympathetic to the appellant's claim, entitlement to DIC benefits is not warranted in this case.  Additionally, because the evidence of record persuasively weighs against her claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply, and her claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
