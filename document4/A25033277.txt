ORDER

 Entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

2. The Veteran's IBS is proximately due to and/or aggravated by his service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with generalized anxiety disorder.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1989 to February 1992.  

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2024 decision.  In May 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2024 decision.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  The AMA Direct Review does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  As this is a Direct Review appeal under the AMA, the record closed as of the January 2024 rating decision. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  In general, service connection requires competent and credible evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Additionally, service connection may be granted, on a secondary basis, for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of an established service-connected disorder.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  Similarly, any increase in severity of a non-service-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the non-service-connected disease, will be service-connected.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).  In the latter instance, the non-service-connected disease or injury is said to have been aggravated by the service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  In cases of aggravation of a veteran's non-service-connected disability by a service-connected disability, the veteran shall be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.322. 

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for IBS, which he contends was caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.  See VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (September 18, 2023). 

There is conflicting evidence as to whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of IBS.

The October 2023 VA examiner did not diagnose the Veteran with any gastrointestinal disability, concluding that review of the Veteran's records failed to confirm a clinical diagnosis of IBS or show objective evidence supporting chronicity of the condition.  She suggested that other acute etiology should be ruled out by performing extensive work ups including blood tests and imaging to help rule out other gastrointestinal problems.  See C&P Exam, October 2023.

However, in an August 2023 medical opinion, Dr. R.D. explained that the Veteran meets the clinical criteria to be diagnosed with IBS.  Dr. R.D. found, "[The Veteran's] service-connected PTSD also caused his to suffer from upper and lower GI pain and dysfunction."  As such, Dr. R.D. opined that that it is at least as likely as not (50% or greater probability) that the Veteran suffers from IBS that is proximately aggravated and exacerbated by his service-connected PTSD with generalized anxiety disorder.  In support of this conclusion, he discussed in some detail medical research supporting a relationship between PTSD and IBS.  See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility, September 2023.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of IBS that is proximately due to and/or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for IBS is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
