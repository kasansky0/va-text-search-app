ORDER

Entitlement to a 30 percent rating for left shoulder bicipital tendinitis with impingement syndrome and arthritis (left shoulder disability) is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for a left shoulder disability is remanded.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is right-hand dominant; therefore, his left shoulder is his minor extremity.

2. The Veteran's left shoulder disability more nearly approximates to the criteria of limitation of motion of flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from side throughout the appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a 30 percent rating for left shoulder bicipital tendinitis with impingement syndrome and arthritis (left shoulder disability) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1970 to September 1973 to include service in the Republic of Vietnam. 

In the March 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims as stated above, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Veteran presented sworn testimony at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in December 2024.

Where a claimant, or the record, raises the question of unemployability due to the disability for which an increased rating is sought, then part of the increased rating claim is an implied claim for TDIU.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009).  The Board takes jurisdiction of the issue of entitlement to a TDIU because it is part and parcel to the increased rating claim on appeal.  Rice, 22 Vet. App. 447.

1. Entitlement to a 30 percent rating for left shoulder disability.

The Veteran contends that his left shoulder disability is more disabling than contemplated.  The Veteran's left shoulder disability is rated at 20 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 5003-5201, effective November 19, 2012. 

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based, as far as can practically be determined, on the average impairment of earning capacity.38U.S.C. §1155 ;38C.F.R. §4.1. Each service-connected disability is rated on the basis of specific criteria identified by Diagnostic Codes.  38C.F.R. §4.27. When rating the Veteran's service-connected disability, the entire medical history must be borne in mind.  Schafrath v. Derwinski,1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Moreover, regulations require that where there is a question as to which of two evaluations is to be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

When rating musculoskeletal disabilities, VA may, in addition to applying schedular criteria, consider granting a higher rating based on functional loss due to limited or excess movement, pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination, to include during flare-ups and with repeated use, when those factors are not contemplated in the relevant rating criteria.  DeLuca v. Brown,8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59. Limitation-of-motion determinations are, if feasible, to be expressed in terms of the degree of additional range-of-motion loss due to any weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, flare-ups, or pain.  DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 207.

By itself, pain throughout a joint's range of motion does not constitute functional loss, but if there is additional pain, the examiner must address any additional loss of motion due to the DeLuca factors.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).

A VA examination of the joints must, wherever possible, include range of motion testing for pain on active motion, passive motion, weight-bearing, non-weight-bearing, and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint. Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158, 16970 (2016); 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that although a VA examination need not be conducted during a flare-up to be adequate for assessing the extent of additional functional loss during a flare-up, an examiner must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the Veteran and offer an opinion based on an estimate derived from information procured from relevant sources, including the lay statements of the Veteran.  Id. at 34-35.

Under the laws administered by VA, disabilities of the shoulder and arm are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5200 through 5203.  For rating purposes, a distinction is made between major (dominant) and minor musculoskeletal groups.  Handedness for the purpose of a dominant rating will be determined by the evidence of record, or by testing on VA examination.  Only one hand shall be considered dominant.  The injured hand, or the most severely injured hand, of an ambidextrous individual will be considered the dominant hand for rating purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 4.69.  Here, as the medical evidence shows that the Veteran is right-hand dominant, and his left shoulder is his minor shoulder for rating purposes.  See VA Examination, March 2020.

Under Diagnostic Code 5201, the major shoulder is rated as follows: limitation of motion to shoulder level (i.e., 90 degrees) warrants a 20 percent rating; motion limited midway between the side and shoulder level (i.e., less than 90 degrees but more than 25 degrees shoulder motion) warrants a 30 percent rating (20 percent for the minor shoulder); and motion limited to 25 degrees or less from the side is rated at 40 percent (30 percent for the minor shoulder). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA revised the criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disorders. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76464 (Nov. 30, 2020); Correction, 86 Fed. Reg. 8142, 8143 (Feb. 4, 2021) (changing new diagnostic code applicable to plantar fasciitis from 5285 to 5269).

VA's General Counsel has held that where a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a claim for a higher rating, the Board must first determine whether the revised version is more favorable to the veteran. In so doing, it may be necessary for the Board to apply both the old and new versions of the regulation. If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the retroactive reach of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. The Board must generally apply both the former and the revised versions of the regulation for the period prior and subsequent to the regulatory change, but an effective date based on the revised criteria may be no earlier than the date of the change.

VA thus must consider the claim for a higher rating pursuant to the former and revised regulations during the latter part of this appeal. See VAOPGCPREC 3 2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 33,422 (2000); DeSousa v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 461, 467 (1997). Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to February 7, 2021, and both the old and new rating criteria from February 7, 2021. The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied.

In this regard, the Board observes that former regulation 38 C.F.R. § 19.9(b)(2) (now renumbered as 38 C.F.R. § 20.904(d)(2)) provided that the Board has the authority to consider appeals in light of laws, including but not limited to statutes, regulations and court decisions that were not previously considered by the agency of original jurisdiction.  In Disabled American Veterans v. Sec of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) specifically upheld the validity of 38 C.F.R. § 19.9(b)(2) (now as noted renumbered as 38 C.F.R. § 20.904(d)(2)).  Id. at 1349.  As such, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.904(d)(2), the Board will proceed to adjudicate the Veteran's claim.

Effective February 7, 2021, the new regulation provided clarification for Diagnostic Codes 5201 and 5202, stating that limitation of motion of the arm includes either flexion or abduction, shoulder level is 90 degrees, and midway between the side and shoulder level is 45 degrees.

Normal forward flexion of the shoulder is 0 to 180 degrees; abduction is 0 to 180 degrees; and internal and external rotation are from 0 to 90 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate I. Forward flexion and abduction to 90 degrees amounts to shoulder level.

After reviewing the relevant medical and lay evidence and applying the above laws and regulations, the Board finds that the Veteran's left shoulder disability most closely approximates a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5201.

The Veteran has consistently reported pain and difficulty lifting his arm, with increased severity and limitation of motion upon repetitive motion.

During the December 2024 hearing, the Veteran testified that his left, non-dominant, arm is weak and has no strength.  He stated that he has impingement in his left shoulder and has had to stop working in part due to his left shoulder.  The Veteran testified that he tried rehab, but it made it worse, and he does not want to take medication like hydrocodone for pain.  He stated that he now has right shoulder problems due to his left shoulder disability.  The Veteran, through his representative, pointed to a medical note from July 2021 that stated that the MRI for the left shoulder is consistent with significant arthritis, wear and tear of rotator cuff with previous-procedure-related changes, joint arthritis, biceps tears and effusion or swelling of the shoulder joint.  

During the March 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he has constant diffuse pain in the left shoulder with limitation of range of motion and reported chronic pain and limitation of range of motion in the right shoulder.  The examiner noted that the Veteran is unable to perform push-ups, pull-ups, or to lift loads overhead, and he has difficulty with activities of daily living, such as dressing.

The examiner noted an initial range of motion of the left shoulder at 0 to 95 degrees for flexion and 0 to 60 degrees for abduction.  Pain was noted on examination, which causes functional loss.  The examiner noted pain with weight bearing and non-weight bearing and pain with passive range of motion.

Given the lay and medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's left shoulder (minor extremity) warrants a 30 percent rating, for the entire period on appeal.

In this regard, the Veteran reported during the March 2020 VA examination that he is in constant pain and cannot perform repetitive motion.  Although the examiner noted that the Veteran's flexion of the left shoulder is only limited to 95 degrees, the examination shows that the Veteran experienced pain in each tested aspect.  As the examiner found that the examination is medically consistent with the Veteran's statements describing functional loss with repetitive use over time, the Board finds that an approximate balance of the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's left and shoulder disability meets or more nearly approximates limitation to 25 degrees from his sides.  Consequently, the Board finds that the maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's left shoulder disability throughout the appeal.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for a left shoulder disability is remanded.

During the December 2024 hearing, the Veteran testified that he has a right shoulder disability due to his service-connected left shoulder disability.  He also testified that he experiences numbness and tingling down his arm.  He stated that he does not like to medication like hydrocodone for his shoulder pain.  Additionally, in the March 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported chronic pain and limitation of range of motion in the right shoulder

In Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162 (2019), the Court held, "VA has powerful, ready-made schedular rating tools with which it can better adjudicate claims that include symptoms and effects not contemplated by an applicable diagnostic code."  Morgan, 31 Vet. App. at 167.  Indeed, the Court stated doing so was necessary to ensure a veteran is appropriately compensated before resorting to § 3.321(b)'s extraschedular provisions.  In doing so, the Court held this included secondary service connection.  Id; see also Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021); Long v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 167, 174 (2020) (en banc), vacated on other grounds sub nom. Long v. McDonough, 38 F.4th 1063 (Fed. Cir. 2022).

However, the March 2020 examination did not address the Veteran's additional symptoms that he contends are related to his left shoulder disability.  As such, the Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error to the extent that the RO failed to discharge its duty to assist prior to the March 2020 rating decision by not affording the Veteran a VA examination to ascertain the full nature, extent, severity, and onset of the Veteran's left shoulder disability.  U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In light of the Veteran's contentions made prior to the rating decision on appeal, the Board finds that further information is necessary to properly rate, on a schedular basis, all of the manifestations of the Veteran's service-connected left shoulder disability, in this case, to include right shoulder disability, peripheral neuropathy, and/or manifestations of the Veteran's service-connected shoulder disability.  As such, on remand, a medical opinion should be obtained to determine any diagnoses the Veteran may have, to include a right shoulder disability and peripheral neuropathy, and whether they are proximately due to his service-connected left shoulder disability.  Morgan; Bailey; Long.

2. Entitlement to a TDIU.

The Veteran asserts that he is unable to obtain and sustain employment due to the aggregate effects of his service-connected disabilities.

On his December 2024 application for TDIU, the Veteran reported that he last worked full-time in March 2014 and reported his last employment was as a compounder.  He noted that he has a high school degree and one year of college education.

During the December 2024 hearing, the Veteran testified that he always worked in physical labor.  He stated that his left shoulder impacted his ability to perform his tasks on a regular basis at his job because he worked as a compounder, and he had to physically pick up and lift chemicals and pour them into the mixing vessels.  He stated that he would overcompensate for his left shoulder pain by using his right shoulder more.  He reported that he would take Tylenol but did not take heavy medications that could be considered unsafe when trying to work.  See VA Form 21-8940, December 2024.  

Given the grant above, the Veteran is assigned a combined 60 percent rating for his service-connected disabilities.  As such, he does not meet the schedular requirements for TDIU.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

Because the Veteran's TDIU claim is inextricably intertwined with the claims remaining on appeal, appellate consideration of entitlement to TDIU rating is deferred pending resolution of the remaining claims on appeal.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991); see also Tyrues v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 166, 177 (2009) (en banc) (explaining that claims are inextricably intertwined where the adjudication of one claim could have a significant impact on the adjudication of another claim).

As to any period wherein the Veteran does not meet the minimum schedular requirements for TDIU, 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) is for consideration.  However, the Board is prohibited from assigning TDIU on the basis of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) in the first instance without ensuring that the claim is referred to VA's Director, Compensation Service, for consideration of an extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  See Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1 (2001).  As to TDIU, the AOJ must consider action consistent with Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

Given the holding in Snider, and to ensure the Veteran has full consideration, the Board finds remand necessary to refer the claim to VA's Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Adjudicate whether service connection is warranted for neurologic impairment of the left upper extremity as well as well service connection is warranted for right shoulder disability is warranted.

2. Unless the schedular criteria for TDIU have been met, refer the Veteran's case to the Director, Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration of the Veteran's TDIU claim pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).
