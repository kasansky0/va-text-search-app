ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain is granted. 

Entitlement to service connection for right knee condition is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran has a current lumbosacral strain that was incurred in service. 

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran has a current right knee disability that was incurred in service. 

3. The persuasive weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's GERD is related to his service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a lumbosacral strain have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.309.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for GERD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Tennessee National Guard and was ordered into Federal service by the President of the United States to serve on active duty from October 2008 to May 2009 during his initial active duty for training and from December 2009 to July 2010 during his deployment to Iraq.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), also known as the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the claimant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the claimant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the claimant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claims of entitlement to service connection for back and right knee conditions, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300. 

However, the constructive possession doctrine allows for evidence that is within VA's control and that "could reasonably be expected to be a part of the record before the Board" to be considered as part of the record. Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611, 613 (1992).  

Qualifying Service

For VA claim purposes, a Veteran is a person who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service, and was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable. 38 U.S.C. § 101(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(d), 3.6. Active service includes serving on active duty, active duty for training (ACDUTRA), or inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA). 38 U.S.C. § 101(2). For VA purposes, "Veteran" status is obtained if a Veteran became disabled or died because of disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during ACDUTRA. 38 U.S.C. § 101(24)(B). Claims based on a period of INACDUTRA are entitled to compensation only for injuries but not diseases incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. 38 U.S.C. § 101(24) (C); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a) (d); Brooks v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 484 (1993). INACDUTRA includes drill weekends and other types of training performed periodically by Reserve and National Guard members.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a current disability related to active duty. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection generally requires competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service event; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and in-service event, the so-called nexus. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the injury or disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a layperson. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a). Competent lay evidence means any evidence not requiring the layperson to have specialized education, training, or experience. For testimony to be probative of any fact, the witness must be competent to testify as to the facts under consideration and must have personal knowledge in order to be considered competent to testify to a matter. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant; however, if the evidence of record is either persuasively for or persuasively against the claim, then the benefit-of-the-doubt rule no longer applies and the claim is instead adjudicated in accordance with the evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Additionally, the Veteran's service personnel records reflect that he is a Persian Gulf War Veteran, and Congress has created special rules with regard to such Veterans establishing entitlement to service connection. Service connection may be established for a chronic disability manifested by certain signs or symptoms which became manifest either during active service in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations during the Persian Gulf War or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 31, 2026, and which, by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis. 38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1).

A qualifying chronic disability means a chronic disability resulting from any of the following (or any combination of the following): an undiagnosed illness; the following medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illnesses that are defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms: (1) chronic fatigue syndrome; (2) Fibromyalgia; (3) Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID); or (4) Any other illness that the Secretary determines meets the criteria in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness; or any diagnosed illness that the Secretary determines in regulations prescribed under 38 U.S.C. § 1117(d) warrants a presumption of service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a).

38 U.S.C. § 1168(b) provides that a TERA examination and opinion is not required if the Secretary determines that there is no indication of an association between the disability claimed by the Veteran and the TERA for which he has submitted evidence. The Secretary has determined that there is no association between physical trauma and TERAs. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) defines "physical trauma" as "a serious injury to the body." Physical trauma also includes trauma due to repetitive use. Here, the Veteran's low back and right knee conditions constitute physical trauma. As the Veteran's conditions are based on physical trauma, a TERA examination and medical opinion are not needed with respect to these conditions. However, a TERA examination was required and conducted for the Veteran's GERD claim in accordance with the Secretary's guidance.

Service connection for lumbosacral strain is granted.

Service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome is granted.

The Veteran contends that his back and knee pain are due to having to wear body armor and walking miles with full gear and a ruck sack during his active-duty initial training and deployment to Iraq. See November 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).

As to the first element of service connection, a current diagnosis, the Board observes the March 2024 rating decision which notes favorable findings that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a lumbosacral strain and right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome. The Board is bound by these favorable findings absent clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Therefore, the first element has been satisfied.

As to the second element of service connection, in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, the Board observes the Veteran's contention that his back and right knee conditions were a result of ruck marching for miles in full military gear. Additionally, the Veteran noted back pain during his September 2017 Periodic Health Assessment and that he experienced recurring muscle, joint and/or low back pain that impacted his duty. The Veteran reported that he did not seek medical attention for his conditions but took over-the-counter medicine for joint pain. See November 2023 Service Treatment Records (STR). Therefore, the second element has been satisfied.

In respect to the third element, the nexus, the VA received medical opinions in April 2024 for the Veteran's back and right knee conditions. At that time, the examiner opined that it was less likely that not that the Veteran's current back and right knee conditions were incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner noted in the rationale that the Veteran's STRs were reviewed and were silent for chronic low back pain or right knee complaint or any injuries that would cause the Veteran's current lumbar strain or right knee condition. The examiner ultimately concluded that there was objective evidence to support a low back or right knee injury in service. See April 2024 CAPRI Records.

The Board find this opinion to be inadequate for VA adjudication purposes. In that regard, the absence of documented treatment in service or thereafter is not fatal to a service connection claim, and the absence of evidence in the service treatment records is an insufficient basis, by itself, for a negative opinion. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). Further, an absence of contemporaneous treatment records cannot be the sole basis for determining the Veteran did not experience the symptoms he reports. See Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Additionally, in the April 2024 VA examinations, the Veteran reported chronic low back pain and chronic medial right knee pain over the years. The Board finds the Veteran's statements to be competent and credible and assigns high probative value. See April 2024 CAPRI Records.

Similarly, during the VA exam for the Veteran's back condition, the examiner noted evidence of pain with right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right lateral rotation, left lateral rotation, active motion, and passive motion that suggest pain, fatigability, weakness, and a lack of endurance, or incoordination which significantly limited the Veteran's functional ability with repeated use over time. The Veteran also experienced localized tenderness, guarding or muscle spasm of the thoracolumbar spine. The examiner noted functional loss in that the Veteran's back condition impacted his ability to perform occupational tasks due to pain with movement of the lumbar spine. Id. 

During the VA exam for the Veteran's right knee condition, the examiner active and passive motion. The examiner further noted functional loss in that the Veteran experienced pain with bending, kneeling, and when lifting heavy objects which impacted his ability to perform occupational tasks. Id.  This evidence in addition to the Veteran's statement of continued pain since service shows that there is at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding whether the Veteran's current low back and right knee conditions were incurred in service; therefore, the benefit of the doubt must be given to the Veteran and service-connection for the Veteran's lumbosacral strain and right knee condition must be granted. 

Entitlement to service connection for GERD is denied.

The Veteran contends that although he is unsure what caused his GERD, he is certain that he acquired it during his time in the military and has suffered from it since then. See November 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation). As previously noted, the Veteran has qualifying service in the Persian Gulf and has been identified as a Persian Gulf Veteran. See January 2023 VA Memo.

In respect to the first element, the Veteran's Annual Periodic Health Assessment noted that the Veteran had been diagnosed and treated for GERD by a provider outside of the military health system prior to November 2019. See November 2023 STR. Therefore, the first element has been met.

As to the second element, the Board observes the March 2024 rating decision which notes a favorable finding that the Veteran is a Gulf War Veteran that had been exposed to particular matter and burn pits. The Board is bound by this favorable finding absent clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Therefore, the second element has been satisfied.

As to the third element, the Court has specifically held that GERD is not eligible for presumptive service connection as a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317; specifically, the Court held that GERD is not a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness for the purposes of subsection (a)(2)(i)(B), as it is a "structural" gastrointestinal disease. Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74, 82-84 (2018). As such, presumptive service connection for GERD due to Persian Gulf War service is not applicable.

Even if service connection is not available on a presumptive basis, service connection may still be available on a direct basis if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994); 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

In April 2024, the VA received a TERA opinion for the Veteran's GERD. At this time, the examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran. The examiner noted in the rationale that GERD is caused by frequent acid reflux - a backup of stomach acid or bile into the esophagus due to relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and is not related to TERA, nor is there a presumptive rationale that can be posited based on pathophysiologic considerations. There are no medical opinions of record to the contrary.

The Board finds the examiner's opinion to be adequate for VA adjudication purposes and persuasive evidence that weighs against the Veteran's claim. The opinion, which was based on the review of the Veteran's documented and asserted medical history and an in-person examinations, constitute probative evidence on the medical nexus question. See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444 (2000). The Board finds that the examiner fully considered the relevant medical evidence and the Veteran's contentions. The Board finds that the medical opinion is fully consistent with the evidence of record.

The Board finds that the evidence of record is persuasively against finding service connection for the Veteran's GERD. When the evidence persuasively favors against the claims of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). In this case, the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim. Therefore, service connection for GERD must be denied.
