ORDER

The appeal to revise a June 3, 2006, rating decision that denied service connection for alveolar bone resorption with upper and lower tooth loss ("dental condition") on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) is denied.

Service connection for a dental condition is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A June 2006 rating decision that denied service connection for a dental condition became final because the Veteran did not file a timely substantive appeal, and new, relevant service records were not received at any time thereafter.

2. The correct facts, as known at the time, were before the VA adjudicators in June 2006, the statutory and regulatory provisions extant at the time were correctly applied, and there was no undebatable error, the commission of which manifestly changed the outcome of the decision denying service connection for a dental condition.

3. Symptoms of a dental condition were not continuous or recurrent in service or since service separation; and there is no medical nexus between the claimed dental condition and active service, including as due to exposure to radiation.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to revision of a June 2006 rating decision that denied service connection for a dental condition on the basis of CUE pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 have not been satisfied.  38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

2. The criteria for service connection for a dental condition have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.311, 3.381, 17.161.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, had active service in the U.S. Army from January 1971 to July 1971.        

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from a February 2021 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO); the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the October 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

With regard to the CUE aspect of this claim, new evidence cannot be considered in deciding motions seeking revision or reversal of prior final decisions based on CUE, as such CUE motions must be based upon the facts and law that existed at the time of the prior decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(iii).

1. The appeal to revise a June 3, 2006, rating decision that denied service connection for alveolar bone resorption with upper and lower tooth loss ("dental condition") on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) is denied.

In January 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, seeking service connection for a dental condition and asserting CUE in a prior rating decision in denying service connection for a dental condition.  

In this regard, the Veteran listed a March 4, 2010, rating decision as the one he was challenging; however, that decision did not address a dental condition.  Review of the file reveals that the last, and only, final denial of a dental condition was made in a June 2006 rating decision; thus, the Board will assume that the June 2006 rating decision is the decision that the Veteran wishes to challenge on the basis of CUE.  

The Veteran seeks revision of a June 2006 rating decision that denied service connection for a dental condition on the basis that it contained CUE.  Specifically, he asserts that he filed an initial claim for a dental condition in 1971 that was granted, but that his original claims file was lost or misplaced, and the subsequently filed 2005 service connection claim was thus erroneously denied.  In addition, he asserts that some of his service treatment records showing in-service dental treatment were contained in the original claims file that was lost, and that VA has failed in its duty to assist him in retrieving the lost records.     

A previous RO determination that is final and binding will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE.  Where evidence establishes such error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  Here, the June 2006 rating decision denied service connection for a dental condition.  The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) challenging this determination, and the AOJ continued to deny the claim in a June 2008 statement of the case (SOC).  The Veteran did not file a timely substantive appeal.  Consequently, the June 2006 rating decision denying service connection for a dental condition became final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.    

Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.  CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error."  It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.  Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE.  Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error."  Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993).  In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different.  Id. at 44. 

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision.  Id. 

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered.  Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992). 

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision.  See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset.  King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014).  The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different.  Id. at 442. 

The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application in claims of CUE. Andrews v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 177, 186 (2004) (citing Russell, 3 Vet. App. at 313) (it is well established that the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine can never be applicable in assessing a CUE motion because the nature of such a motion is that it involves more than a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated). 

As a threshold matter, the Board finds that the arguments advanced by the Veteran allege CUE with the requisite specificity.  See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003).  The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of his claim. 

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that there was no CUE in the June 2006 rating decision and that, consequently, revision of that decision is not warranted.

VA regulations, at the time of the 2006 rating decision and currently, provide that dental disorders which may be compensable include irreplaceable missing teeth, and disease and damage to the jaw.  38 C.F.R. § 4.150, DCs 9900-9916.  Tooth loss is only compensable where it is due to loss of substance of the body of the maxilla or mandible without loss of continuity.  Id., DC 9913.

Treatable carious teeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar abscesses, and periodontal disease will be considered service-connected solely for the purpose of establishing eligibility for outpatient dental treatment.  In determining service connection, the condition of teeth and periodontal tissues at the time of entry into active duty will be considered.  Treatment during service, including filling or extraction of a tooth, or placement of a prosthesis, will not be considered evidence of aggravation of a condition that was noted at entry, unless additional pathology developed after 180 days or more of active service.  Teeth noted as normal at entry will be service-connected if they were filled or extracted after 180 days or more of active service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.381; see also 38 C.F.R. § 17.161.

The evidence of record at the time of the June 2006 rating decision included service treatment records which were silent for any report, findings, symptoms, treatment, or diagnosis of any dental conditions.  The January 1971 enlistment Report of Medical Examination did not indicate any missing or carious teeth.  An April 1971 Report of Medical Examination, less than 180 days after enlistment, indicated 4 missing teeth and assigned "Class II" for dental defects, indicating that the Veteran required non-urgent dental treatment or reevaluation for oral conditions which were unlikely to result in a dental emergency within one year.  An undated dental chart in the service treatment records reflects no dental treatment and no missing teeth. 

Following separation from active service, an August 2002 letter from Dr. Z., MD, indicates that the Veteran had been a patient since August 2000, that he was no longer able to chew solid foods, and that his dentist was unable to fit him with dentures due to his strong gag reflex.  The doctor recommended dental implants.

An August 2002 private treatment record of Dr. B., DDS, indicates that the Veteran had so much atrophy of the maxilla and mandible that he was unable to wear dentures.  He was on a diet of mashed potatoes, sloppy joes, cheese, etc.  This was a medically critical situation that could be remedied by the Veteran getting implants and maxillary and mandibular prostheses to chew with.  Prior to placement of the implants in the maxilla, he would require bilateral sinus lifts and sub-antral augmentation to create enough space for the placement of implants to the maxilla.

A July 2005 letter from Dr. B. indicated that the Veteran's alveolar bone resorption of both maxillary and mandibular arches had rendered him unable to wear dentures at all.  He required bilateral sinus lifts and substantial bone augmentations, then placement of eight root form implants followed by a cast custom bar connecting the implants and a palateless implant overdenture.  

In July 2005, the Veteran filed an initial claim of entitlement to service connection for his dental condition, claiming that after training with tactical nuclear weapons, he soon began developing dental problems.  Soon after his discharge, VA replaced numerous teeth due to the exposure.  The problem had continued to worsen and due to the subsequent loss of all of his teeth and severe bone loss, he was not even able to wear dentures. 

Based on this evidence, the June 2006 rating decision denied the claim of entitlement to service connection for a dental condition, finding that a review of service records failed to show exposure to ionizing radiation during service.  Further, service treatment records were negative for complaints of or treatment for the condition, and there were no post-service records showing continuous treatment since service.  Therefore, the AOJ concluded there was no medical nexus between the current dental condition and active service.  

The Veteran contends that the June 2006 rating decision contains CUE because he states that his original claims file was lost.  He has stated that he filed an initial claim of entitlement to service connection for a dental condition in 1971, right after service separation, that was granted, but that VA lost his claims file, which also included service treatment records showing treatment for his dental condition.  He asserts that VA failed in its duty to assist him in retrieving the lost records.  

The Board first observes that there is no indication in the record that the service treatment records are incomplete.  They include records dating from his January 1971 enlistment examination up through June 21, 1971, which is less than one month prior to his separation.  There is also no indication his claims file is incomplete; it includes records dating back to 1974.  Absent clear evidence to the contrary, there is a presumption that public officers have properly discharged their official duties, which includes keeping and managing records.  See Miley v. Principi, 366 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In any case, regarding the Veteran's assertion that VA committed CUE in failing to assist him in searching for the purported missing records, it is well established that allegations that VA failed in its duty to assist are, as a matter of law, insufficient to form a basis for a claim of CUE.  Cook v. Principi, 318 F.3d 1334, 1345-47 (Fed. Cir. 2002); see also Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377, 384 (1994).  As noted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in Cook, the requirements that a clear and unmistakable error be both outcome determinative and based on the record that existed at the time of the original decision make it impossible for a breach of the duty to assist to form the basis for a CUE claim.  Cook, 318 F.3d at 1346.  In other words, any breach by VA of its duty to assist, such as a failure to assist a veteran in obtaining records, cannot form a basis for a claim of CUE because such a breach creates only an incomplete record rather than an incorrect one.  See Tetro v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 100, 109 (2000); Crippen v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 412, 424 (1996). 

The Veteran has not made any other assertions of CUE in the June 2006 rating decision.  Consequently, the Board finds that the June 2006 rating decision was not clearly and unmistakably erroneous and no revision is warranted.  

2. Service connection for a dental condition is denied.

As noted above, the Veteran contends that his dental condition is related to radiation exposure from training with tactical nuclear weapons in service.   

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that "Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability.  In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim."  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); see also Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143-44 (1992).

At the outset, the Board observes that the AOJ, in the January 2021 rating decision on appeal, determined that new and relevant evidence had been received and adjudicated the claim on the merits.  The finding of new and relevant evidence to warrant readjudication is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to address the claim on its merits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

Service connection for a disorder which is claimed to be attributable to ionizing radiation exposure during service can be accomplished in three different ways.  See Ramey v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 40, 44 (1996), affirmed at 120 F.3d. 1239 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  First, there are certain types of cancer which will be presumptively service connected for radiation-exposed veterans.  The Veteran in this case has not been diagnosed with any of the diseases presumptively related to radiation exposure.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1112(c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(d). 

Second, 38 C.F.R. § 3.311(b) includes a list of "radiogenic diseases" which will be service connected provided that certain conditions specified in that regulation are met.  For purposes of this section the term "radiogenic disease" means a disease that may be induced by ionizing radiation and includes a number of cancers.  The regulation states that, if the veteran has one of the radiogenic diseases, a radiation dose assessment will be obtained, and the case will be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits for review as to whether sound scientific medical evidence supports the conclusion that it is at least as likely as not that the veteran's disease resulted from radiation exposure during service.  In this case, the Veteran has not been diagnosed with any of the radiogenic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.311(b).

Third, direct service connection can be established by "show[ing] that the disease or malady was incurred during or aggravated by service, a task which includes the difficult burden of tracing causation to a condition or event during service."  See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  

Here, the Veteran's Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) is listed as trainee on his DD Form 214.  He completed Basic Training and was assigned to B Battery, 4th Battalion, 39th Field Artillery, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where his principal duty was as a cannoneer.  There is no documentation in the personnel records of the Veteran having worked with tactical nuclear weapons or of having otherwise been exposed to ionizing radiation.  Thus, the Veteran's contentions that he worked with tactical nuclear weapons, which are accepted as accurate, do not place his claim under the scope of the cited provisions addressing diseases associated with ionizing radiation and radiogenic diseases, and development under these provisions is not necessary.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.311(b).  As above, the Board also notes that the claimed dental condition is not listed among the radiogenic diseases under 38 C.F.R. § 3.311(b).  Accordingly, as there is no evidence from official sources of actual exposure to ionizing radiation in this case, the Board finds that the provisions pertaining to claims based on radiation exposure are not for application in this case, and that further development pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.311 is not necessary in this case.  Moreover, for the reasons discussed below, the weight of the evidence is against a finding of a medical nexus between the claimed dental condition and exposure to non-ionizing radiation in active service.

The relevant VA regulations and evidence of record have been discussed above.  As discussed above, service treatment records are entirely negative for any signs, symptoms, reports, treatment, or diagnoses of a dental condition.  To the extent that the April 1971 Report of Medical Examination showing four missing teeth which were not noted at the January 1971 enlistment examination indicates that these teeth were extracted, such extraction took place less than 180 days after the Veteran entered active service.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.381, 17.161.  Thus, the evidence does not show a compensable dental condition in service and weighs against a finding of continuous symptoms of the claimed disability during active service.    

The Board next finds that the weight of the evidence demonstrates that symptoms of a dental condition were not continuous or recurrent since separation from active service in July 1971.    

The first post-service documentation of a dental condition was in 2000, when Dr. Z. indicated she began treating the Veteran, as outlined above.  The absence of post-service complaints, findings, diagnosis, or treatment for back problems for nearly 30 years after service separation is one factor that tends to weigh against a finding of continuous or recurrent symptoms of the claimed disability after service separation.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (the lack of contemporaneous medical records is one fact the Board can consider and weigh against the other evidence, although the lack of such medical records does not, in and of itself, render the lay evidence not credible).    

With regard to the Veteran's more recent assertions made in the context of the current disability claim of continuous or recurrent dental condition symptoms since service, the Board finds that, while the Veteran is competent to report the onset of symptoms of the claimed disability, these more recent assertions are outweighed by the other, more contemporaneous, lay and medical evidence of record, both in service and after service, and are not reliable.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  The Board finds that the Veteran's assertions of continuous or recurrent symptoms of the claimed disability after service are not accurate because they are outweighed by other evidence of record that includes the more contemporaneous service treatment records, which are entirely negative for any signs, symptoms, reports, findings, treatment, or diagnoses of a dental condition; and the lack of any medical documentation of reports or treatment for a dental condition until 2000, nearly 30 years after service separation.

As such, the Board does not find that the evidence sufficiently supports continuous or recurrent symptomatology of the claimed disability since service so as to warrant a grant of service connection. 

Finally, the Board finds that the weight of the competent medical evidence weighs against a finding of a medical nexus between the current dental condition and active service.  The Board notes that no competent medical opinions have been received relating the claimed dental condition to active service to include exposure to radiation, nor does the medical evidence of record otherwise suggest such an etiological relationship.     

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's belief that his dental condition is related to his active service.  However, his statements alone do not establish a medical nexus.  Indeed, while the Veteran is competent to provide evidence regarding matters that can be perceived by the senses, he is not shown to be competent to render medical opinions on questions of etiology.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology).  As such, as a layperson, he is without the appropriate medical training and expertise to offer an opinion on a medical matter, including the diagnosis, etiology, or causation of a specific disability.  The question of diagnosis and causation, in this case, involves complex medical issues that the Veteran is not competent to address.  Jandreau.

In sum, after a review of all the evidence of record, lay and medical, the Board finds that the weight of the most probative evidence demonstrates there is no relationship between the Veteran's current dental condition and his military service, including no credible evidence of continuous or recurrent symptoms of the claimed disability during active service, continuous or recurrent symptomatology of the claimed disability following service separation, or competent medical evidence establishing a link between the current disability and active service, including as due to radiation exposure.  Therefore, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence that is of record weighs against the claim for service connection for the dental condition and outweighs the Veteran's more recent contentions regarding in-service continuous or recurrent symptoms and continuous or recurrent post-service symptoms.

For these reasons, the claim for service connection must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).
