ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a cancerous head lesion is dismissed.

Entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for malignant neoplasm of the face/head (claimed a lump on his forehead), to include precancerous actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma, based on disfigurement of the face/head, is denied.

Entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for malignant neoplasm of the face/head, to include precancerous actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma lesions, based on painful scarring, is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the pendency of the appeal of a September 2023 rating decision that denied service connection for a cancer lump on the head, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), in December 2023, granted service connection for malignant neoplasm of the face/head (claimed as a cancer lump on the head).

2. The Veteran's face/head scars are at least one-quarter inch (0.6 cm.) wide at widest part. There are no other characteristics of disfigurement, no visible or palpable tissue loss, and no gross distortion or asymmetry of the facial features.

3. The Veteran has no more than two painful service-connected scars; the scars are not unstable, associated with underlying soft tissue damage, nor do they cover an area or areas of 929 square centimeters or greater.

4. Throughout the pendency of the appeal, the Veteran's hypertension required continuous use of medication for control but has not been manifested by diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more or a history thereof, or systolic blood pressure predominantly 160 or more.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. There remains no case or controversy as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for a claimed cancer lump on the head, as the benefit sought on appeal was granted. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

2. The criteria for an initial rating greater than 10 percent for a malignant neoplasm of the face/head, to include precancerous actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma lesions, based on disfigurement, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800.

3. The criteria for an initial rating greater than 10 percent for a malignant neoplasm of the face/head, to include precancerous actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma lesions, based on painful scarring, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.

4. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from February 2004 to November 2014 and in the United States Air Force from September 2010 to February 2011. His service included tours of duty in Kuwait and Afghanistan. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2022, September 2023 and December 2023 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). On the notice of disagreement (NOD) (VA Form 10182) received in December 2023, the Veteran elected the direct review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence that was of record at the time of the rating decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

I. Service Connection for a Cancerous Head Lesion

In the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied service connection for a cancer lump on the head. However, in the December 2023 rating decision also on appeal, the AOJ found clear and unmistakable error in that decision and granted service connection for malignant skin neoplasm of the face/head (claimed as a cancer lump on the head). Thus, the present appeal is moot as there remains no case or controversy for adjudication of the issue of entitlement to service connection for a cancer lump on the head. Therefore, the present appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

II. Increased Rating Claims

A.	Malignant Neoplasm of the Face/Head to Include Precancerous Actinic Keratosis and Basal Cell Carcinoma 

As noted above, the AOJ, in December 2023, found clear and unmistakable error in the September 2023 rating decision that denied service connection for a cancer lump on the head. Also in December 2023, the AOJ found clear and unmistakable error in an October 2023 decision that granted service connection for actinic keratosis assigning a 0 percent rating, and granted service connection for residual scars, right and left upper extremity, assigning 0 percent ratings for each upper extremity, effective August 8, 2023. In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for malignant neoplasm of the face/head (claimed as a lump on his forehead), to include precancerous actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma, based on disfigurement, and assigned a 10 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800. The AOJ also granted service connection for malignant neoplasm of the face/head, to include precancerous actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma, based on painful scars, and assigned a 10 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804. The effective date of these grants is August 10, 2022. See PACT Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168, § 403(d)(2) (2022). (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.).

Rating Criteria

Scars are rated under Diagnostic Codes 7800 through 7805 within 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Under Diagnostic Code 7800, for disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for scarring with one characteristic of disfigurement. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips); or two or three of the characteristics of disfigurement. A 50 percent disability rating is warranted with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips); or four or five characteristics of disfigurement. An 80 percent disability rating is warranted with visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips); or six or more characteristics of disfigurement.

The eight characteristics of disfigurement for the purposes of rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 are: scar of 5 in. or more (13 or more centimeters (cm.)) in length; scar at least 1/4 in. (0.6 cm.) wide at its widest part; surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation; scar adherent to underlying tissue; skin hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding 6 sq. in. (39 sq. cm.); skin texture abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding 6 sq. in. (39 sq. cm.); underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding 6 sq. in. (39 sq. cm. ); and skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding 6 sq. in. (39 sq. cm.). Id., Note (1).

Under Diagnostic Code 7801, scars not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage warrant a 10 percent rating when they cover an area or areas of at least 39 square centimeters but less than 77 square centimeters. Higher ratings are warranted when the scar covers a larger area or areas.

Under Diagnostic Code 7802, scars not of the face, head or neck that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage warrant a 10 percent rating for an area of 929 square centimeters or greater.

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, a 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful; a 20 percent rating is warranted for three or four scars that are unstable or painful; a 30 percent rating is warranted for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. 

Note (1) following Diagnostic Code 7804 provides that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.

Note (2) following Diagnostic Code 7804 provides that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, 10 percent is to be added to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.

Note (3) following Diagnostic Code 7804 provides that scars evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an additional rating under Diagnostic 7804 when applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.

Under Diagnostic Code 7805, any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 are to be evaluated under an appropriate Diagnostic Code.

Facts

VA outpatient records show that the Veteran presented to a medical facility in December 2022 with a new lesion on his face and was diagnosed as having basal cell carcinoma of the right temple. His medical history includes basal cell carcinoma of the right temple and left check in 2017, and of the right pinna in 2013. In February 2023, the Veteran underwent Mohs excision of the right temple nodular basal cell carcinoma followed by Mohs repair of the right temple. A February 2023 dermatology progress note shows that the Veteran had a well healed linear scar on the right temple. An April 2023 VA outpatient record shows that the Veteran underwent cryotherapy for 10 actinic keratosis lesions on his face. 

A VA contract skin examination report in September 2023 contains a diagnosis of status post excision (Moh's surgery) of basal cell carcinoma right temple with less than 5 percent of exposed area. The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have any residual conditions or complications due to the neoplasm or its treatment other than those already documented. With respect to scarring on the Veteran's upper extremities, the examiner stated that there was no diagnosis because there were no findings, signs and/or symptoms to support a diagnosis. The examiner added that the skin condition did not affect the Veteran's ability to work. 

A VA contract scar/disfigurement examination report in October 2023 reflects a diagnosis of residuals scars, right temple and left cheek, due to basal cell carcinoma, and residual scars left forearm (4) and right forearm (1), due to actinic keratosis. The right arm scar measured 1 cm x .2 cm and was stable and not painful and had no underlying tissue damage. The four left arm scars measured .1 cm x .2 cm, .3 cm x .5 cm, .5 cm x .5 cm., and .5 cm x .3 cm. These scars were also stable and not painful and had no underlying tissue damage. The total area of the right forearm scar was .2 square cm, and the total area of the left forearm scars was .57 square cm. 

Examination findings with respect to the right temple and left cheek scars in October 2023 show that the scars were not unstable but were painful and tender. The right temple scar measured 7 cm x .4 cm, and the left cheek scar measured .5 cm x .5 cm. The total area of the face/head scars was 2.82 square cms. The scars were not elevated or depressed, they did not adhere to underlying tissue, and there was no missing underlying soft tissue. Both scars had hypopigmentation. There was no gross distortion of facial features and tissue loss for the head, face and neck. Additionally, the examiner reported that there were no pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms associated with these scars, including limitation of function, and the scars did not affect the Veteran's ability to work.

Discussion

1. Disfigurement

The Veteran has been assigned a 10 percent rating for one characteristic of disfigurement of the scarring area combined (left cheek and right temple) being at least one-quarter inch (0.6 cm.) wide at the widest part. 38 C.F.R. §4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800. In this regard, the findings outlined above show that one face scar was located on the left cheek measuring .5 cm x .5 cm, and one head scar was located on the right temple measuring 7 cm x .4 cm, for a total area of 2.82 square cms.

A higher evaluation of 30 percent under Diagnostic Code 7804 is not warranted unless there is medical evidence of visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with two or three characteristics of disfigurement.

As noted, the October 2023 examination findings show the Veteran does not have visible or palpable tissue loss associated with his face and head scars. Rather, the scars were found to not be adherent to underlying tissue, nor was there missing underlying soft tissue. Additionally, there was no gross distortion of facial features and no tissue loss for the head, face and neck. 

The Veteran does not argue that the VA exam was inadequate or that the examiner's findings were inaccurate. He has not submitted or identified any other evidence in support of an increased scar rating for disfigurement or on any other basis and the Board finds no such evidence in the record.

The Board thus finds that the evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's left cheek scar and right forehead temple scar are manifested by visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of the facial features or with two or three characteristics of disfigurement. As the evidence is persuasively against this claim and is not in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and the claim for a greater than 10 percent rating for a malignant neoplasm of the face/head, to include precancerous actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma lesions, based on disfigurement, must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Painful Scars

The Veteran has been assigned a 10 percent rating for painful scars. 38 C.F.R. §4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804. This is based on VA contract scar/disfigurement examination findings in October 2023 that show that the Veteran's right temple and left cheek scars were painful and tender. As noted, a higher rating of 20 percent requires three or four scars that are unstable or painful, and a 30 percent rating requires five or more scar that are unstable or painful. Id. Regarding the Veteran's right and upper left arm scars, the September 2023 skin examiner reported there was no diagnosis because there were no findings, signs and/or symptoms to support a diagnosis. However, the October 2023 VA contract scar/disfigurement examiner noted upper forearm scars to include one right forearm scar and four left forearm scars. However, this examiner found that the scars were stable and were not painful. 

The Veteran does not argue that the VA examination was inadequate or that the examiner's findings were inaccurate, nor has he submitted or identified any other evidence in support of an increased scar rating for painful scars. 

Regarding a separate rating under Diagnostic Code 7802, as the total area of the scars do not exceed 144 square inches (929 sq. cm), a rating under this code is not warranted. 

Regarding a separate rating under Diagnostic Code 7805, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under DCs 7800-7804. In this regard, the October 2023 examiner found no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms associated with the scars, including limitation of function. Therefore, a rating under this code is not warranted.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a higher than 10 percent rating for painful scars and against separate compensable ratings under any other pertinent diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. §4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7802-7805. As the evidence is persuasively against the claim and is not in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

B. Hypertension

Throughout the pendency of the appeal, the Veteran's service-connected hypertension has been evaluated as noncompensably disabling under Diagnostic Code 7101 for hypertension vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension). 38 C.F.R. § 4.104. Under Diagnostic Code 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or where an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. A 40 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. Lastly, a 60 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. 

Notes to Diagnostic Code 7101 provide that hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days. For purposes of this section, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm. or greater with a diastolic pressure of less than 90mm. Additionally, hypertension due to aortic insufficiency or hyperthyroidism, which is usually the isolated systolic type, should be evaluated as part of the condition causing it rather than by separate evaluation. Finally, hypertension should be evaluated separately from hypertensive heart disease and other types of heart disease.

VA outpatient records show recorded blood pressure readings of 156/86 in March 2021, 131/78 in October 2021, 137/85 in February 2022, and 138/79 in April 2022. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA contract hypertension examination in September 2022. The examiner noted the diagnosis of hypertension, and that the Veteran was taking continuous medication, Lisinopril (20 mg), for his hypertension. His reported blood pressure readings during the examination were 150/95, 150/95, and 149/97. The examiner also noted that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more. In addition, the examiner reported that there were no other pertinent findings, complications, conditions, signs or symptoms related to the Veteran's hypertension. Regarding the effect of the condition on the Veteran's ability to work, the examiner reported that the Veteran lost 0 to 1 week of work time in the past 12 months. The examiner went on to report that limitations included worsening recurrent elevated blood pressure readings, lightheadedness, fatigue, and an inability to tolerate strenuous activities. 

A VA outpatient record in December 2022 contains a blood pressure reading of 130/83.

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for a compensable rating for hypertension at any time during the pendency of the appeal. Although the Veteran has been taking blood pressure medication to control his hypertension, he has not at any time during the pendency of the appeal been shown to have a diastolic pressure predominately above 100 or a systolic pressure predominately 160 or above. Pertinent treatment records do not show such readings, and the September 2022 examiner specifically noted that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more.

Furthermore, while the Veteran has been prescribed medicine to treat his hypertension, the Board notes that the rating criteria for such disability specifically contemplate the use of medication to ameliorate symptoms, and a compensable rating may not be assigned based solely on the fact that the Veteran uses medication to treat his symptoms. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 272-73 (2016) (the Board did not err in failing to discount the ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication as the plain language of Diagnostic Code 7101 contemplates the effects of medications). Under Diagnostic Code 7101, hypertension is rated based on actual blood pressure readings. The Diagnostic Code does not include any criteria, mechanism, or method for rating hypertension based on blood pressure readings that would be expected if the Veteran were to stop taking medications. Accordingly, the Board has based its decision on the blood pressure readings of record. As noted, the record does not show that the Veteran has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more that, in combination with his required continuous use of medication for control, would warrant a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7101.

In making its determination in this case, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's belief that his hypertension symptoms are more severe than as reflected by the currently assigned rating. While the Board recognizes that the Veteran is competent to provide statements regarding his observable symptomatology, he is not competent to provide an opinion regarding the severity of his symptomatology in accordance with the rating criteria which is a more complex question. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Rather, the Board finds the medical evidence in which a professional with medical expertise examined the Veteran, acknowledged his reported symptoms, and described the manifestations of such disability to be more persuasive than his reports regarding the severity of such disability.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that an increased rating for the Veteran's hypertension is not warranted. In reaching this determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the probative evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable, and the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F. 4th at 776.
