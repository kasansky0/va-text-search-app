ORDER

The request for waiver of the overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits in the amount of $2,746.67 was not timely filed; the appeal is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a March 2014 letter, the Veteran was notified that he owed a debt of $2,746.67; this letter provided details related to his right to request a waiver.

2. More than nine years later, in September 2023, the Veteran requested a waiver of the recovery of the debt.  

3. The record does not include evidence of and the Veteran does not contend there was a delay in the Veteran's receipt of the notification of indebtedness as a result of VA or postal authority error, or due to other circumstances beyond his control. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran did not apply for a waiver of recovery of overpayment of VA benefits in the amount of $2,746/67 in a timely manner. 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. § 1.963(b)(2).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force from January 1977 to July 1977.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2023 Decision on Waiver of Indebtedness by the VA Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in November 2023. The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 COWC decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

A request for waiver of an indebtedness shall only be considered if made within 180 days following the date of a notice of indebtedness to the debtor. The 180-day period may be extended if the individual requesting waiver demonstrates, as a result of error by either VA or the postal authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, there was a delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing. If the debtor does substantiate there was such a delay in the receipt of the notice of indebtedness, the 180-day period shall be computed from the date of the debtor's actual receipt of the notice of indebtedness. 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. § 1.963(b)(2). 

In March 2014, the VA Debt Management Center (DMC) notified the Veteran of an overpayment in the amount of $2,746.67. This letter informed the Veteran that this debt related to a change in his entitlement to VA education benefits resulting from termination or changes in his training. The letter also informed the Veteran of his right to request a waiver and provided him with the information as to his rights and obligations in this regard. 

The Veteran requested a waiver of the recovery of the debt more than nine years later in September 2023.  The Veteran's request was denied as it was not received with 180 days of the notification letter.  In conjunction with his appeal, the Veteran has not made any arguments to suggest any reason for the delay, to include no suggestion that there was a delay in receipt of the December 2014 DMC letter as a result of error by either VA or the postal authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control.

Based upon the foregoing, the Board concludes that the Veteran did not timely request a waiver of recovery of an overpayment of VA benefits. The appeal is denied.
