ORDER

The reduction in the Veteran's rating for residuals of traumatic brain injury (TBI), from 70 percent to 10 percent, effective May 1, 2021, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran to withdraw his pending appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant or his authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

In the present case, in March 2025, the Veteran's representative submitted a correspondence that requested to withdraw the Veteran's appeal as to the issue of residuals of TBI.  Therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
