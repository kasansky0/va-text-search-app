REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1999 to November 2003, from January 2006 to August 2006, from July 2010 to March 2011, from October 2011 to April 2012, from June 2015 to March 2016, from August 2016 to November 2016, and from July 2019 to February 2020. The Veteran also had service in the National Guard with active duty for training from December 2007 to January 2008 and from July 18, 2010 to July 24, 2010.

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017.  115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

The Veteran's appeal stems from a September 2022 rating decision.  In October 2022, the Veteran sought a higher-level review of the September 2022 rating decision.  In December 2022, the VA Regional Office (RO) issued a higher-level rating decision which readjudicated most issues therein, but determined that a duty to assist error had been made with regard to claims for entitlement to service connection for GERD and IBS, entitlement to service connection for hypertension, entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder, entitlement to service connection for skin cancer, entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, and entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  Additional development was then conducted with regard to those claims, and in June 2023 and July 2023, the RO issued additional rating decisions readjudicating those claims with consideration of the additional evidence obtained.

In August 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) with addendum, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 rating decision on appeal as well as the June 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions which corrected duty to assist errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence added to the claims file after these rating decisions may not be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601(f), 20.301.

Parenthetically, the Board observes that the Veteran's claims for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, entitlement to service connection for skin cancer, entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction, entitlement to service connection for a hernia, entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disorder, entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disorder, entitlement to service connection for a right knee disorder, entitlement to service connection for a left knee disorder, and entitlement to service connection for a neck disorder were initially denied by the VA Regional Office (RO) in a September 2021 rating decision.  The current appeal stems from a supplemental claim received in April 2022.  In a July 2023 higher level review rating decision, the AOJ explicitly found that new and relevant evidence had been submitted with regard to the claim for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.  Although the September 2022 rating decision and December 2022 higher level review rating decision did not explicitly find that new and relevant evidence was submitted with regard to the remaining claims for service connection, the December 2022 higher level review rating decision adjudicated the claims on the merits; therefore, it is implied that new and relevant evidence was submitted, which is a favorable finding.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Therefore, the Board will adjudicate these claims on the merits.

SERVICE CONNECTION

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from diseases or injuries which are present in service or for a disease diagnosed after separation from service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Service connection may be awarded on a presumptive basis to a Persian Gulf veteran who (1) exhibits objective indications; (2) of a chronic disability such as those listed in paragraph (b) of 38 C.F.R. § 3.317; (3) which became manifest either during active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, or to a degree of 10% or more not later than December 31, 2021; and (4) such symptomatology by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis.  Gutierrez v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2004); 38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317; 76 Fed. Reg. 81834 -81836 (Dec. 29, 2011).

Objective indications of a chronic disability include both 'signs,' in the medical sense of objective evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical indicators that are capable of independent verification.  Disabilities that have existed for six months or more and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of improvement and worsening over a six-month period will be considered chronic.  The six-month period of chronicity will be measured from the earliest date on which the pertinent evidence establishes that the signs or symptoms of the disability first became manifest.  A chronic disability resulting from an undiagnosed illness referred to in this section shall be rated using evaluation criteria from the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities for a disease or injury in which the functions affected, anatomical localization, or symptomatology are similar.  A disability referred to in this section shall be considered service-connected for the purposes of all laws in the United States.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(3-5).

Signs or symptoms which may be manifestations of an undiagnosed illness include, but are not limited to, fatigue, signs or symptoms involving the skin, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, neurologic signs or symptoms, neuropsychological signs or symptoms, signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower), sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal signs or symptoms, cardiovascular signs or symptoms, abnormal weight loss, or menstrual disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b).

In addition to certain chronic disabilities from undiagnosed illness, service connection may also be given for medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome) that is defined by a cluster of signs and symptoms, as well as for any diagnosed illness that the VA Secretary determines by regulation warrants a presumption of service connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i)(B).  

The term "Persian Gulf Veteran" means a Veteran who served on active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia Theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.  The Southwest Asia Theater of operations includes Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and the airspace above these locations.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e).  The record confirms that the Veteran had active duty service in Kuwait from August 2010 to February 2011 and in Qatar from July 2019 to January 2020.  Accordingly, he is a Persian Gulf Veteran.

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, was enacted on August 10, 2022.  Section 405 of the PACT Act reduces the threshold for establishing eligibility when considering presumptive service connection for Persian Gulf War veterans.  Presumptive conditions under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a) and (b) may now manifest to any degree at any time.  There is no longer a requirement for a chronic disability to manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more prior to December 31, 2026.  The end date is no longer applicable and will be removed in a forthcoming regulation.

Additionally, the PACT Act expanded the definition of a Persian Gulf veteran to include those who served in the countries of Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, and Jordan, along with those who served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e).

Pursuant to the PACT Act, exposure to burn pits and other toxins (BPOT) is presumed for "covered veterans," i.e., those who served in specific locations on or after specific dates. 38 U.S.C. § 1119.  Any veteran who, on or after August 2, 1990, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in and/or airspace above Bahrain; Iraq; Kuwait; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Somalia; the United Arab Emirates; the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia; the Gulf of Aden; the Gulf of Oman; the Persian Gulf; the Arabian Sea; or the Red Sea will be presumed BPOT exposed, as will any veteran who, on or after September 11, 2001, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in and/or airspace above Afghanistan; Djibouti; Egypt; Jordan; Lebanon; Syria; Yemen; or Uzbekistan.  38 U.S.C. § 1119; VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 7, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).  Certain diseases will be presumed related to service for veterans with in-service toxic exposure, including BPOT exposure. 38 U.S.C. § 1120.

1. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea

Under the AMA, the Board must accept any favorable findings made by the AOJ in its adjudication of the claims.  The July 2023 higher level review rating decision contains favorable findings with regard to the existence of a current diagnosis of sleep apnea and the Veteran's participation in toxic exposure risk activity during service in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War.  Thus, the AOJ's favorable findings demonstrate the first and second elements of service connection: a current disability and an in-service injury or event.

After thorough consideration of the record, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence of record supports a grant of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, as the weight of the persuasive evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current obstructive sleep apnea is related to his active duty service.  In a June 2023 VA opinion, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's current sleep apnea was caused by or incurred as a result of in-service exposure to particulate matter during service in Southwest Asia.  The examiner cited a medical study which showed a "clear relationship" between apnea-hypopnea index and particulate matter exposure, and that particulate matter exposure substantially increased the relative risk for obstructive sleep apnea.  The Board finds the June 2023 VA opinion to be probative in this case, as it is based upon a review of the pertinent evidence of record and provides supporting explanation and rationale for its conclusion with proper citation to medical treatise information relied upon in the opinion.  The Board finds this medical opinion to persuasively support a nexus between the Veteran's current sleep apnea and his active duty service.

Although a July 2023 VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was not caused by or incurred as a result of his toxic exposure incurred during service, the Board does not find this opinion to be probative because it failed to address the credible medical treatise evidence cited by the June 2023 VA examiner.

In sum, the evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is related to his active duty service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction

The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for erectile dysfunction.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of section 1110 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

After thorough review of the pertinent evidence of record, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d).

The Veteran has not identified any medical treatment records pertaining to erectile dysfunction.  Further, the Veteran's VA treatment records associated with the claims file are silent for any complaints of or treatment for erectile dysfunction, and do not show a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.  In fact, the only reference to erectile dysfunction noted in the VA treatment records are instances in which the Veteran denied experiencing symptoms of erectile dysfunction.  

Furthermore, the Veteran has not provided any lay statements describing symptoms of erectile dysfunction; nor has he otherwise identified evidence supporting a finding that he currently has erectile dysfunction.

Moreover, service connection for erectile dysfunction as a qualifying chronic disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted.  As noted, the Veteran had documented service in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations during the Persian Gulf War.  However, the evidence does not establish the presence of a qualifying chronic disability.  In that regard, he has not identified any signs or symptoms of erectile dysfunction which could be signs or symptoms identified by the pertinent regulations as manifestations of an undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b).

As noted above, in the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim for entitlement to service connection.  Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.  In light of the evidence showing that the Veteran does not have diagnosed erectile dysfunction or a qualifying chronic disability, the Board concludes that the persuasive evidence of record is against the claim for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction.  Because the persuasive evidence of record is against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application.  See Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.  Service connection for erectile dysfunction is denied.

INCREASED RATINGS

Disability ratings are determined by the application of the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21; see also Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).  Where the Rating Schedule does not provide for a noncompensable evaluation for a diagnostic code, a noncompensable evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

The primary concern in a claim for an increased evaluation for service-connected disability is the present level of disability.  Although the overall history of the disability is to be considered, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, when an appeal is based on the assignment of an initial rating for a disability, following an initial award of service connection for this disability, the rule articulated in Francisco does not apply.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  Instead, the evaluation must be based on the overall recorded history of a disability, giving equal weight to past and present medical reports.  Id.  VA has a duty to consider the possibility of assigning staged ratings in all claims for increase.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

3. Entitlement to a compensable initial disability rating for hypertension

Service connection for hypertension was granted in a June 2023 rating decision, and a noncompensable disability rating was assigned, effective July 24, 2020, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.  The Veteran contends that a compensable initial disability rating is warranted.

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, hypertension is rated as 10 percent disabling when there is diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

The medical evidence of record includes numerous blood pressure readings relevant to this issue.  For the purpose of reporting these blood pressure readings, the systolic blood pressure reading will be listed first, followed by a slash, and the diastolic blood pressure reading will be listed last.

A June 2023 VA examination reflects blood pressure readings of 130/76, 124/76, and 120/74.  The Veteran did not report taking any medication to treat his blood pressure, but noted that he watched his diet and took fish oil.  The examiner clarified that the Veteran's treatment plan did not include taking continuous medication for hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension.  The examiner diagnosed hypertension, and concluded that the Veteran's hypertension did not impact his ability to work.

An April 2023 VA day two blood pressure check reflects blood pressure readings of 126/80, 124/82, and 118/84.  A day three blood pressure check shows blood pressure readings of 122/82, 124/80, and 126/86.

VA treatment records from 2021 through 2023 document blood pressure readings of 118/74, 118/76, 120/80, 122/80, 125/82, 135/88, 138/79, 142/87, and 145/90.  VA treatment records also reflect that the Veteran was prescribed amlodipine besylate for blood pressure or heart during the pertinent time period on appeal.

After thorough review of the pertinent evidence of record, the Board concludes that a compensable initial disability rating is not warranted for the Veteran's service-connected hypertension.  Although the evidence shows that the Veteran was prescribed continuous medication to treat his hypertension, the Veteran's blood pressure readings do not reflect diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.  Review of the evidence of record during the time period pertinent to the appeal reflects no blood pressure readings demonstrating diastolic pressure of 100 or more or systolic pressure of 160 or more.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has been prescribed medication to treat his hypertension during the appeal period.  However, because Diagnostic Code 7101 contemplates the ameliorative effect of medication, the Board need not consider the severity of the Veteran's blood pressure when not taking his prescribed continuous medication.  See McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271-73 (2016) (holding that Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012), does not apply to Diagnostic Code 7101).

As the Veteran's blood pressure readings do not approximate the criteria associated with a compensable rating, entitlement to a compensable initial disability rating for hypertension is not warranted.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application, and the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

4. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for a right hand scar and entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 10 percent for a painful right hand scar

Service connection for a right hand scar was granted in a September 2021 rating decision, and a noncompensable disability rating was assigned, effective July 24, 2020, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.  In April 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for right hand scars.  In a September 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied a compensable disability rating for a right hand scar but granted service connection for a painful right hand scar assigning a 10 percent disability rating, effective May 13, 2022, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.  The Veteran contends that a compensable disability rating is warranted for a right hand scar and an initial disability rating greater than 10 percent is warranted for a painful right hand scar.

Effective August 13, 2018, the rating criteria for skin disabilities were revised.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 32, 592 (July 13, 2018).  As this appeal was initiated after August 13, 2018, the revised rating criteria are applicable.

Under Diagnostic Code 7801 for burn scars or scars due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage, a 10 percent rating is warranted for such scars with an area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm.), but less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.); a 20 percent rating is warranted for scars with an area or areas of at least 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.) but less than 72 square inches (465 sq. cm.); a 30 percent rating is warranted for scars with an area or areas of at least 72 square inches (465 sq. cm.) but less than 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.); and a maximum 40 percent rating for scars with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7801.

Under Diagnostic Code 7802 for burn scars or scars due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, a maximum 10 percent disability rating is warranted for such scars with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, one or two scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 10 percent disability rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.  A 20 percent disability rating is applicable when there are three or four scars that are unstable or painful.  Id.  A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted when there are five or more scars that are unstable or painful.  Id.

After thorough review of the evidence of record, the Board concludes that a compensable disability rating is not warranted for a right hand scar, and an initial disability rating greater than 10 percent is not warranted for a painful right hand scar.

An August 2021 VA examination noted one scar located on the right hand along the thenar muscles.  The examiner reported that the scar was not painful and was not unstable with frequent loss of covering of the skin over the scar.  Additionally, the scar was not due to a burn.  The scar measured 4 centimeters (cm.) by .25 cm. and was not reported to be tender to palpation or unstable, and did not have underlying soft tissue damage.  The approximate total area of the scar was noted to be 1 square centimeter.  The examiner also noted that the scar did not result in limitation of function and that there were no other pertinent physical findings.  The examiner concluded that the scar did not impact the Veteran's ability to work.

The Veteran underwent another VA scars examination in May 2022.  The examiner observed that the Veteran had one scar located on the right hand which was painful but was not unstable with frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  The scar was not due to a burn.  The examiner reported that the scar measured 1.8 cm. by 0.1 cm., with an approximate total area of 0.18 square centimeters.  The examiner noted that the right hand scar resulted in limitation of function of the right hand, as it caused weakness in the right hand due to the painful scar.

The Veteran also underwent a VA hand and fingers examination in May 2022.  The examiner noted that the Veteran was right hand dominant.  The Veteran reported right hand symptoms resulting in functional loss, including decreased strength and sharp pain with hand use as well as throbbing after use of the hand.  He denied any treatment for his symptoms.  He also denied flare-ups of symptoms.  On physical examination right hand range of motion was decreased, which impaired the use of the hand.  There was normal active range of motion of the right index finger, right long finger, right ring finger, and right little finger; however, there was reduced thumb flexion of the MCP to 85 degrees while flexion of the IP was normal to 90 degrees.  There was pain with right thumb range of motion, but passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion.  There was no gap between the pad of the thumb and fingers, but there was tenderness to palpation of the thumb base.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing of the right hand digits with no additional loss of range of motion.  The examiner noted that the Veteran was examined immediately after repeated use over time, but reported no additional loss of range of motion due to pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination with repeated use over time.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran was not examined during a flare-up, but that the evidence did not suggest additionally impaired functional ability with flare-ups.  Muscle strength testing revealed reduced right hand grip strength of 2/5 without muscle atrophy.  There was no ankylosis of the right index finger, long finger, ring finger, little finger, or thumb.  The diagnosis was painful scar of the right hand.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's right hand scar impacted his ability to work, as decreased right hand strength affected his activities of daily living.

After thorough review of the evidence of record, the Board concludes that a compensable disability rating is not warranted for the Veteran's right hand scar described in the August 2021 VA examination, and an initial disability rating greater than 10 percent is not warranted for the painful right hand scar documented in the May 2022 VA examination.  The August 2021 VA examination reported one right hand scar which measured 4 cm. by 0.25 cm. which was stable and not painful.  The scar was not due to a burn and did not have a total area equal to or greater than 39 sq. cm.  The May 2022 VA examination noted one right hand scar which measured 1.8 cm. by 0.1 cm. which was not unstable with frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar, but which was painful.  The scar was not due to a burn and did not have a total area equal to or greater than 39 sq. cm.  

As the Veteran's right hand scar described in the August 2021 VA examination did not have an area of 39 sq. cm. or greater and was not painful or unstable, a compensable disability rating for the right hand scar is not warranted.  As the right hand scar reported during the May 2022 VA examination was painful but not unstable and did not have an area of 39 sq. cm. or greater, an initial disability rating greater than 10 percent is not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, 7804.

The Board has also considered whether a separate disability rating is warranted under Diagnostic Code 5228 for the Veteran's right thumb limitation of motion with reduced grip strength, documented in the May 2022 VA examination.  Diagnostic Code 5228 provides a 10 percent rating where there is a gap of one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.  However, the May 2022 VA examination reported that there was no gap between the pad of the thumb and the fingers.  Accordingly, a separate rating for such findings is not warranted, as the medical evidence does not establish ankylosis of any right hand digit or a gap of less than one inch between the thumb and fingers.

The Board has considered whether there is any other schedular basis for granting a compensable rating for a right hand scar or an initial rating greater than 10 percent for a painful right hand scar, but has found none.  The service-connected scars are not due to a burn, are not located on the head, face, or neck, do not have an area of 39 sq. cm. or more, and have not resulted in any disabling effects not considered by Diagnostic Codes 5228, 7801, 7802 or 7804.  

The doctrine of reasonable doubt does not apply as the evidence persuasively weighs against the claims for increased ratings.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Lynch, 21 F.4d 776.

EFFECTIVE DATES

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, is the date of receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The effective date of compensation will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application unless the application is received within one year of discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

To preserve an effective date, an intent to file a claim may be submitted to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought within one-year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

The effective date for an award of increased compensation will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  Specific to claims for increased disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred, if a claim is received by VA within one year after that date.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155.  The amended regulations apply to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Under the AMA, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or issue by filing a supplemental claim following notice of a decision by the AOJ or the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  For effective dates, when a supplemental claim is received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ or Board issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(h)(2).

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Entitlement to service connection for IBS with GERD was granted in a June 2023 rating decision, effective August 10, 2022.  

Entitlement to service connection for GERD was first denied in a January 2019 rating decision.  Notice of that rating decision was provided to the Veteran on February 4, 2019.

The current appeal stems from a July 24, 2020 Intent to File, which was followed within one year by a June 11, 2021 supplemental claim seeking service connection for GERD.  A July 2021 rating decision denied service connection for IBS and GERD, and the Veteran filed a supplemental claim seeking service connection for IBS and GERD in April 2022, within one year of the July 2021 rating decision.  Thereafter, a September 2022 rating decision determined that no new and relevant evidence had been received with regard to the claim.  In October 2022, the Veteran filed a Higher Level Review Request and in a December 2022 Higher Level Review rating decision, the RO returned the claim for additional development, finding that a duty to assist error had occurred.  Thereafter, in June 2023, the RO issued another rating decision which granted service connection for IBS with GERD, effective August 10, 2022.

The June 2023 rating decision states that service connection for IBS with GERD was warranted, effective August 10, 2022, under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act).  However, the opinion also reports that service connection for IBS with GERD was warranted "as directly related to military service" based upon an April 2023 VA opinion which linked the IBS with GERD to in-service toxic exposure activities.

Initially, the Board observes that GERD and IBS are not presumptive conditions for Persian Gulf War veterans under the PACT Act.  Nevertheless, the PACT Act identified additional toxic exposures for Persian Gulf War veterans based upon exposures to burn pits and other toxins.

The RO's June 2023 rating decision granted service connection for IBS with GERD based on a positive April 2023 VA opinion, and assigned an effective date of August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the PACT Act.  However, in this case, while a TERA opinion was obtained pursuant to the PACT Act, the positive opinion and the grant of service connection were based on the fact that the Veteran's IBS with GERD were manifestations of a functional gastrointestinal disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  Thus, as the April 2023 VA opinion concludes that the Veteran's IBS with GERD constituted a functional gastrointestinal disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, the grant would have been allowable by law prior to the enactment of the PACT Act.

As the grant of service connection for IBS with GERD was not based on a change in the law, but rather on a finding that the Veteran's IBS with GERD constituted a functional gastrointestinal disorder directly related to service in Southwest Asia, the correct effective date is the date of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114(a); 3.400.  

Here, the Veteran continuously pursued his claim for service connection for IBS with GERD since the July 24, 2020 Intent to File.  As noted above, the Veteran filed a June 2021 supplemental claim within one year of the July 24, 2020 Intent to File.  A rating decision was issued in July 2021, and the Veteran filed another supplemental claim in April 2022, within one year of receipt of the July 2021 rating decision.  Thereafter, a September 2022 rating decision was issued, followed by an October 2022 Higher Level Review request.  A December 2022 Higher Level Review rating decision found a duty to assist error, and a June 2023 rating decision granted service connection.  The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182 in August 2023.  As the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim since July 24, 2020, this is the proper date of claim.

Additionally, the record reflects that the Veteran was diagnosed with GERD prior to the date of claim.  See November 2018 VA examination report.  Thus, the date entitlement arose was prior to the date of receipt of claim.

Finally, because the Veteran's July 24, 2020 Intent to File was received within one year of his discharge from service on February 21, 2020, the proper effective date for the grant of service connection for GERD with IBS is February 22, 2020, the date following the Veteran's discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Accordingly, an effective date of February 22, 2020, but no earlier, is warranted for the grant of service connection for IBS with GERD.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 24, 2020 for the grant of service connection for hypertension

The Veteran requests an effective date prior to July 24, 2020 for the grant of service connection for hypertension.

On July 24, 2020, the Veteran filed an Intent to File.  On June 11, 2021, he submitted a formal claim seeking service connection for hypertension.  A September 2021 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for hypertension.  In April 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for hypertension.  A September 2022 rating decision concluded that new and relevant evidence was not received to readjudicate the claim.  In October 2022, the Veteran filed a Higher Level Review request, and in a December 2022 Higher Level Review rating decision, the RO determined that a duty to assist error had occurred and requested additional development.  In June 2023, the RO issued a rating decision which granted service connection for hypertension, effective July 24, 2020.

The current appeal originates from a supplemental claim application received on April 13, 2022.  In a June 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for hypertension, effective July 24, 2020 based upon the date of receipt of a July 24, 2020 Intent to File followed by a June 11, 2020 formal claim, as the Veteran continuously pursued his claim for service connection for hypertension since that time.

Review of the record reflects that the Veteran filed an initial claim seeking service connection for hypertension in June 2020, following a July 24, 2020 Intent to File.  The effective date for an award of service connection cannot be earlier than the date of receipt of claim unless the application is received within one year of discharge from service.  Because the Veteran's July 24, 2020 Intent to File was received within one year of his discharge from service on February 21, 2020, the proper effective date for the grant of service connection for hypertension is February 22, 2020, the date following the Veteran's discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Accordingly, an effective date of February 22, 2020, but no earlier, is warranted for the grant of service connection for hypertension.

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to July 24, 2020 for the grant of service connection for a right hand scar and entitlement to an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 for the grant of service connection for a painful right hand scar

The Veteran contends that an effective date prior to July 24, 2020 is warranted for the grant of service connection for a right hand scar and that an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 is warranted for the grant of service connection for a painful right hand scar.  

Service connection for a right hand scar was granted in a September 2021 rating decision, and a noncompensable disability rating was assigned, effective July 24, 2020.  Service connection for a painful right hand scar was granted in a September 2022 rating decision, and a 10 percent disability rating was assigned, effective April 13, 2022.  

The Veteran filed an Intent to File on July 24, 2020, followed by a June 11, 2021 claim for entitlement to service connection for a right hand scar.  A September 2021 rating decision granted service connection for a right hand scar and assigned a noncompensable disability rating, effective July 24, 2020.  In April 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim application for a right hand scar.  A September 2022 rating decision denied a compensable disability rating for right hand scar and granted service connection for a painful right hand scar, effective April 13, 2022.  In October 2022, the Veteran filed a Higher Level Review request, and a December 2022 Higher Level Review rating decision denied a compensable rating for a right hand scar and denied an initial rating greater than 10 percent for a painful right hand scar.  The December 2022 rating decision also denied an effective date prior to July 24, 2020 for the grant of service connection for a right hand scar and denied an effective date prior to May 13, 2022 for the grant of service connection for a painful right hand scar.

Because the Veteran filed a supplemental claim in April 2022, he has continuously pursued his claims for entitlement to increased ratings and earlier effective dates for right hand scars since his July 24, 2020 Intent to File.  Accordingly, the date of claim in this case is July 24, 2020, the date of receipt of an Intent to File followed within one year by receipt of a July 2021 original claim seeking service connection for right hand scars.

With regard to the claim for entitlement to an effective date prior to July 24, 2020 for the grant of service connection for a right hand scar, the Board observes that the effective date for an award of service connection cannot be earlier than the date of receipt of claim unless the claim was filed within one year of discharge from service.  Because the Veteran's July 24, 2020 Intent to File was received within one year of his discharge from service on February 21, 2020, the proper effective date for the grant of service connection for a right hand scar is February 22, 2020, the date following the Veteran's discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Accordingly, an effective date of February 22, 2020, but no earlier, is warranted for the grant of service connection for a right hand scar.

However, entitlement to an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 for the grant of service connection for a painful right hand scar is not warranted.  Review of the record reveals that the first evidence indicating a painful right hand scar was noted in the Veteran's April 13, 2022 TDIU claim form when he reported that his right hand scar contributed to an inability to secure or follow substantially gainful employment.  This was corroborated by a May 2022 VA examination report which documented findings of a painful right hand scar with resulting limitation of motion of the right hand thumb.  As April 13, 2022 is date of the earliest evidence suggesting that the Veteran experienced a painful right hand scar, April 13, 2022 is the date that entitlement arose.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1), the effective date for continuously pursued claims "will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later...."  As discussed above, the date of claim in this case is July 24, 2020, and the date entitlement arose is April 13, 2022.  Because April 13, 2022 is the later of the date of claim and the date entitlement arose, an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 is not warranted for the grant of service connection for a painful right hand scar.

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 for the grant of a 100 percent disability rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to include traumatic brain injury (TBI) 

The Veteran contends that an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 is warranted for his 100 percent disability rating for PTSD with TBI.  

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  An exception regarding increased rating claims is that the date shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if a claim is received within one year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  If the increase became ascertainable more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim, then the proper effective date would be the date of claim.  Finally, if the increase occurs after the claim is filed, the effective date shall be the date the increase occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126-27 (1997).

Under the AMA, a timely filed supplemental claim or higher-level review request establishes continuous pursuit. 38 C.F.R. §3.2500 (h).

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder was granted in a January 2019 rating decision, and a 50 percent disability rating was assigned, effective July 12, 2018.  The January 2019 rating decision also granted service connection for TBI and assigned a noncompensable disability rating, effective July 12, 2018.  On July 24, 2020, the Veteran filed an Intent to File, followed by a June 11, 2021 claim seeking an increased rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  In a September 2021 rating decision, the RO recharacterized the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder as PTSD with TBI and decreased the 50 percent disability rating to 30 percent, effective August 20, 2021.  On April 13, 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim seeking an increased rating and earlier effective date for PTSD.  In a September 2022 rating decision, the RO granted an increased rating of 100 percent for PTSD with TBI, effective April 13, 2022.  The Veteran filed a Higher Level Review request in October 2022.  In a December 2022 Higher Level Review rating decision, the RO denied an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 for the grant of a 100 percent rating for PTSD with TBI.  

Review of the September 2022 rating decision which awarded a 100 percent disability rating for PTSD with TBI shows that the effective date of April 13, 2022 was awarded based upon the date of receipt of the April 13, 2022 supplemental claim seeking an increased rating.

Initially, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim seeking an increased rating for PTSD with TBI has been continuously pursued since July 24, 2020; thus, that is the date of claim.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's July 24, 2020 Intent to File was submitted within one year of receipt of the January 2019 rating decision which granted service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and assigned a 50 percent disability rating; however, the Veteran filed a June 2021 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) thereafter, rather than one of the available administrative review options provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  Because the Veteran filed a new claim rather than a supplemental claim or request for higher-level review in June 2021, the Veteran's claim has not been continuously pursued since his initial July 2018 claim.  Nevertheless, the Veteran's claim has been continuously pursued since the July 24, 2020 Intent to File; thus, July 24, 2020 is the date of claim.

The Veteran's PTSD with TBI is rated under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.124a, 4.130, Diagnostic Codes 8045-9411.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen.  The hyphenated codes for the Veteran's PTSD with TBI residuals reflect that residuals of TBI is the service-connected disability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045 and PTSD due to TBI is the basis of the rating assigned under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

Generally, TBI is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045, Residuals of TBI.  Note (1) provides that "There may be an overlap of manifestations of conditions evaluated under the table titled 'Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment and Other Residuals Of TBI Not Otherwise Classified' with manifestations of a comorbid mental or neurologic or other physical disorder that can be separately evaluated under another diagnostic code.  In such cases, do not assign more than one evaluation based on the same manifestations.  If the manifestations of two or more conditions cannot be clearly separated, assign a single evaluation under whichever set of diagnostic criteria allows the better assessment of overall impaired functioning due to both conditions.  However, if the manifestations are clearly separable, assign a separate evaluation for each condition."

The evidence shows that the Veteran suffers from manifestations that cannot be clearly separated.  See August 2021 VA examination, which indicates that there is overlap of symptoms between the Veteran's PTSD and TBI and it is not possible to differentiate which symptoms are attributable to TBI and which are attributable to PTSD.

Because the manifestations of the Veteran's PTSD and TBI are not clearly separable, the Board must "assign a single evaluation under whichever set of diagnostic criteria allows the better assessment of overall impaired functioning due to both conditions."  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045, Residuals of TBI Note (1).  For the reasons that follow, the Board finds a rating under the diagnostic criteria for PTSD is most appropriate.

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Rating Formula), ratings are assigned according to the level of occupational and social impairment caused by the disability.  The use of the term "such as" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating.  Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).  Accordingly, the evidence considered in determining the level of impairment under § 4.130 is not restricted to the symptoms provided in the Diagnostic Code.  VA must consider all symptoms of a claimant's condition that affect the level of occupational and social impairment. When determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign for psychiatric disabilities, the Board's "primary consideration" is the Veteran's symptoms.  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Under the General Rating Formula, a 30 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events).  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, General Rating Formula.

A 50 percent rating is for application when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  Id.

A 70 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals that interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  Id.

A maximum 100 percent rating is warranted for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Id.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is for application as this appeal was initiated after August 4, 2014.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.125, 4.130; 79 Fed. Reg. 45093, 45099 (effective date provisions); 80 Fed. Reg. 53, 14308 (March 19, 2015) (adopting the final rule recognizing that the DSM-IV was rendered obsolete by the publication of the DSM-5 in May 2013).  The DSM-5 eliminated Global Assessment of Function scores for several reasons, including conceptual lack of clarity and questionable psychometrics in routine practice.

Diagnostic Code 8045 states that there are three main areas of dysfunction that may result from traumatic brain injuries and have profound effects on functioning: cognitive (which is common in varying degrees after a traumatic brain injury), emotional/behavioral, and physical. Each of these areas of dysfunction may require evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045.

Cognitive impairment is defined as decreased memory, concentration, attention, and executive functions of the brain.  Executive functions are goal setting, speed of information processing, planning, organizing, prioritizing, self-monitoring, problem solving, judgment, decision making, spontaneity, and flexibility in changing actions when they are not productive.  Not all of these brain functions may be affected in a given individual with cognitive impairment, and some functions may be affected more severely than others.  In a given individual, symptoms may fluctuate in severity from day to day.  Adjudicators are to evaluate cognitive impairment under the table titled "Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment and Other Residuals of TBI Not Otherwise Classified."  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045.

Subjective symptoms may be the only residual of TBI or may be associated with cognitive impairment or other areas of dysfunction.  Adjudicators are to evaluate subjective symptoms that are residuals of TBI, whether or not they are part of cognitive impairment, under the subjective symptoms facet in the table titled "Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment and Other Residuals of TBI Not Otherwise Classified."  However, they are to separately evaluate any residual with a distinct diagnosis that may be evaluated under another Diagnostic Code, such as migraine headache or Meniere's disease, even if that diagnosis is based on subjective symptoms, rather than under the "Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment and Other Residuals of TBI Not Otherwise Classified" table.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045.

Adjudicators are to evaluate emotional/behavioral dysfunction under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 (Schedule of ratings--mental disorders) when there is a diagnosis of a mental disorder.  When there is no diagnosis of a mental disorder, they are to evaluate emotional/behavioral symptoms under the criteria in the table titled "Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment and Other Residuals of TBI Not Otherwise Classified."  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045.

Adjudicators are to evaluate physical (including neurological) dysfunction based on the following list, under an appropriate Diagnostic Code: motor and sensory dysfunction, including pain, of the extremities and face; visual impairment; hearing loss and tinnitus; loss of sense of smell and taste; seizures; gait, coordination, and balance problems; speech and other communication difficulties, including aphasia and related disorders, and dysarthria; neurogenic bladder; neurogenic bowel; cranial nerve dysfunctions; autonomic nerve dysfunctions; and endocrine dysfunctions.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045.

The preceding list of types of physical dysfunction does not encompass all possible residuals of TBI.  For residuals not listed here that are reported on an examination, adjudicators are to evaluate under the most appropriate Diagnostic Code.  Adjudicators are to evaluate each condition separately, as long as the same signs and symptoms are not used to support more than one evaluation and combine under § 4.25 the evaluations for each separately rated condition.  The evaluation assigned based on the "Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment and Other Residuals of TBI Not Otherwise Classified" table will be considered the evaluation for a single condition for purposes of combining with other disability evaluations.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045.

The table titled "Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment and Other Residuals of TBI Not Otherwise Classified" contains 10 important facets of TBI related to cognitive impairment and subjective symptoms.  It provides criteria for levels of impairment for each facet, as appropriate, ranging from zero to three, and a fifth level, the highest level of impairment, labeled "total".  However, not every facet has every level of severity.  The Consciousness facet, for example, does not provide for an impairment level other than total," since any level of impaired consciousness would be totally disabling.  Adjudicators are to assign a 100 percent evaluation if "total" is the level of evaluation for one or more facets.  If no facet is evaluated as "total," adjudicators are to assign the overall percentage evaluation based on the level of the highest facet as follows: zero = zero percent; one = 10 percent; two = 40 percent; and three = 70 percent.  For example, assign a 70 percent evaluation if three is the highest level of evaluation for any facet.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045.

The evaluation assigned is based upon the highest level of severity for any facet of cognitive impairment and other residuals of traumatic brain injury (TBI) not otherwise classified as determined on examination.  Only one evaluation is assigned for all the applicable facets.  A higher evaluation is not warranted unless a higher level of severity for a facet is established on examination.  Physical and/or emotional/behavioral disabilities found on examination that are determined to be residuals of traumatic brain injury are evaluated separately.

After thorough review of the pertinent evidence of record, the Board concludes that an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 is not warranted for the Veteran's 100 percent disability rating for PTSD with TBI because entitlement to a 100 percent disability rating for PTSD with TBI did not arise prior to April 13, 2022.

VA treatment records from 2019 through 2022 reflect diagnoses of and treatment for PTSD and TBI.  The records show that the Veteran endorsed symptoms including anxiety, panic attacks, sleep disturbance, nightmares or flashbacks, hypervigilance, and social isolation.  Mental status examinations showed good insight and anxious mood, good or fair judgment, normal speech, normal thought content and thought processes, no evidence of forgetfulness, and full orientation.  Grooming and hygiene were good and there was no psychomotor agitation or retardation.  The Veteran denied anxiety, depression, and suicidal and homicidal ideation.  The Veteran reported TBI symptoms including headache and changes in mood with easy agitation and difficulty focusing.  The Veteran also reported that he had a few friends, but not many.  He noted good relationships with his family, including his parents, sisters, and dog.

In August 2021, the Veteran underwent a VA PTSD examination.  The Veteran reported that he lived with his dog and that he had support from his parents.  He indicated that he had a few friends but generally avoided being with others.  He explained that socializing could be difficult for him.  He also reported that he had not been employed since his discharge from military service, but was considering options for education and employment.  The examiner reported that the Veteran exhibited symptoms including depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events; and disturbances of motivation and mood.  On mental status examination, the Veteran was relatively well-groomed, alert, and fully oriented.  Eye contact was appropriate and speech was normal.  Mood was dysphoric and affect was appropriate.  The Veteran was tearful but maintained composure.  Thought processes were logical, coherent, and goal-directed and thought content was normal.  There was no evidence of hallucinations and the Veteran denied suicidal and homicidal ideation.  Insight and judgment appeared intact.  The diagnoses were PTSD and TBI.  The examiner noted that it was not possible to differentiate which symptoms were attributable to TBI and which symptoms were attributable to PTSD.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's PTSD with TBI resulted in occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by medication.

The Veteran also underwent a VA TBI examination in August 2021.  The Veteran reported TBI symptoms including frequent headaches which interfere with employment.  Judgment was normal, social interaction was routinely appropriate, orientation was normal, motor activity was normal, visual spatial orientation was normal, communication was normal, consciousness was normal, and there were no neurobehavioral effects.  The examiner found that there was a complaint of mild memory loss (such as having difficulty following a conversation, recalling recent conversations, remembering names of new acquaintances, or finding words, or often misplacing items), attention, concentration, or executive functions, but without objective evidence on testing.  The examiner explained that the Veteran occasionally had trouble getting places and recalling events.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran experienced subjective symptoms which do not interfere with work, activities of daily living, or close relationships, noting that the Veteran's headaches affected his ability to work.  The diagnosis was TBI, and the examiner concluded that the Veteran's TBI did not impact his ability to work.

Initially, the Board concludes that the pertinent evidence of record does not support a finding that the criteria for a 100 percent disability rating prior to April 13, 2022 were met under Diagnostic Code 8045.  In that regard, an August 2021 VA TBI examination reflects that the highest level of impairment for any facet shown was one, as there was mildly impaired memory loss and subjective symptoms which do not interfere with work, activities of daily living, or close relationships.  As the highest level of impairment for any facet associated with TBI was one which equates to a 10 percent disability rating, such findings do not support the assignment of a 100 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 8045.

Additionally, the pertinent evidence of record prior to April 13, 2022 do not support the assignment of a 100 percent disability rating for PTSD with TBI under Diagnostic Code 9411.  

In that regard, the evidence does not more nearly approximate the criteria for a disability rating of 100 percent, as the evidence does not show functional impairment comparable to total occupational and social impairment.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411; Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  "[A] veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration."  Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 116-17.  

The persuasive evidence of record documents symptoms including anxiety, panic attacks, sleep disturbance, nightmares, flashbacks, hypervigilance, social isolation, depressed mood, suspiciousness, mild memory loss, and disturbances of motivation and mood.  Mental status examinations showed the Veteran to have dysphoric or anxious mood with appropriate affect.  He was well-groomed, alert, and fully oriented.  Eye contact and speech were normal.  Thought processes and thought content were normal.  Insight and judgment were fair or good, but intact.  There is no evidence suggesting that the Veteran experienced gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting himself or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living; disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

Additionally, the evidence does not show that the Veteran experienced other symptoms of a similar severity, frequency, or duration sufficient to meet the criteria for a 100 percent disability rating prior to April 13, 2022.  In that regard, the persuasive evidence of record does not show total occupational and social impairment prior to April 13, 2022.  Although the Veteran reported that he had not worked since service discharge, he stated that he was considering options for education and employment.  Additionally, the Veteran regularly reported good relationships with his parents and sisters and noted that he had a few friends; thus, the evidence does not show total social impairment prior to April 13, 2022.

Ultimately, the Board concludes that the pertinent evidence of record weighs against finding that the Veteran met the criteria for a 100 percent disability rating for PTSD with TBI prior to April 13, 2022.  

The first medical evidence of record which indicates that the Veteran's PTSD with TBI met the criteria for a 100 percent disability rating is a September 1, 2022 VA examination which opined that the Veteran's PTSD with TBI resulted in total occupational and social impairment.  As the September 1, 2022 VA examination is the first evidence that the Veteran's PTSD with TBI results in total occupational and social impairment, the date entitlement to a 100 percent disability rating arose is September 1, 2022.

In conclusion, although the date of claim for the Veteran's PTSD with TBI claim is July 24, 2020, an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 is not warranted for the 100 percent disability rating for PTSD with TBI, as the pertinent evidence of record does not show that entitlement to an increased rating of 100 percent arose prior to April 13, 2022.  As noted above, the appropriate effective date for an increased disability rating is either the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  In this case, the date of claim is July 24, 2020, and the date entitlement arose is September 1, 2022.  Because the later of those dates is September 1, 2022, entitlement to an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 for the grant of a 100 percent disability rating for PTSD with TBI is not warranted.  Thus, the claim is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for skin cancer; entitlement to service connection for a hernia; entitlement to service connection for a right knee disorder; entitlement to service connection for a left knee disorder; entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disorder; entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disorder; and entitlement to service connection for a neck disorder 

As noted above, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, VA will pay compensation to a Persian Gulf veteran for disability due to an undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness, provided that certain requirements are met.  A medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness is defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms, and includes chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and functional gastrointestinal disorders.  Signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed illness and medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness include: fatigue; signs or symptoms involving the skin; headache; muscle pain; joint pain; neurological signs or symptoms; neuropsychological signs or symptoms; signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system; sleep disturbances; gastrointestinal signs or symptoms; cardiovascular signs or symptoms; abnormal weight loss; and menstrual disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  The Veteran is a Persian Gulf War veteran.

The Veteran's claims file is silent for diagnoses of hernia, a right knee disorder, right and left shoulder disorders, and a neck disorder.  It notes a history of skin cancer. While a November 2018 VA examination report notes a diagnosis of left knee strain and patellofemoral pain syndrome, such diagnoses are symptom-based diagnoses.  

Because the Veteran's claimed disabilities may constitute undiagnosed illnesses or a medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness, the AOJ's failure to obtain VA examinations to determine whether these claimed disorders constitute undiagnosed illnesses or chronic multisymptom illnesses constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  Thus, remand for such development is warranted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 13, 2022 for the award of special monthly compensation at the housebound rate and entitlement to an effective date prior to April 13, 2021 for the grant of a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) 

The Board finds that these claims are inextricably intertwined with the disabilities remaining on appeal.  Therefore, a final decision on the issue of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the award of TDIU and special monthly compensation benefits cannot be rendered at this time.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991) (two issues are "inextricably intertwined" when they are so closely tied together that a final decision on one issue cannot be rendered until a decision on the other issue has been rendered).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Provide the Veteran with VA examinations by appropriate physicians to determine the existence and etiology of his skin disorder, hernia, right knee disorder, left knee disorder, right and left shoulder disorders, and neck disorder.  The Veteran's claims file, all electronic records, and a copy of this remand must be reviewed by the examiner, and the examiner must state that this evidence was reviewed in the examination report.  All pertinent symptomatology and findings must be reported in detail.  All indicated tests and studies must be accomplished.  After a thorough review of all evidence in the claims file, to include the Veteran's service treatment records, the post-service treatment records, and the Veteran's lay statements, the examiner should address the following:

(a.) Can the Veteran's skin symptoms, hernia symptoms, right knee symptoms, left knee symptoms, right and left shoulder symptoms, and neck symptoms be attributed to a known clinical diagnosis (other than a symptom-based diagnosis)?

(b.) If a diagnosis cannot be rendered, are the Veteran's symptoms a manifestation of: (i) an undiagnosed illness; (ii) a diagnosable but medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness of unknown etiology; (iii) a diagnosable chronic multisymptom illness with a partially explained etiology; or (iv) a disease with a clear and specific etiology?

(c.) For any diagnosed disability, the examiner is asked to opine whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's disability was caused by or incurred during service, to include whether it first manifested during service, and whether it is directly related to any environmental exposure in Southwest Asia.

A complete rationale for all opinions must be provided.  The examiner is asked to review the Veteran's lay statements of record with regard to the onset and continuity of his symptoms, and is advised that the Veteran is competent to report observable symptomatology.
