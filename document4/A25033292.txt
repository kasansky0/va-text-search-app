ORDER

Entitlement to benefits under the Home Improvement and Structural Alterations (HISA) program for improving the entrance to the Veteran's home, to include railings, is granted, subject to laws and regulations regarding payment.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is service connected for coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at 100 percent disabling, depressive disorder associated with hypothyroidism at 50 percent disabling, mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy of both eyes associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) at 40 percent disabling, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PN) of the right and left upper extremity radial nerve at 30 and 20 percent disabling respectively, diabetic PN of the left and right sciatic nerve at 20 percent disabling each, DM at 20 percent disabling, diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve of the right and left lower extremity each at 20 percent disabling, tinnitus at 10 percent disabling, as well as bilateral hearing loss, scars, hypertension and erectile dysfunction at 0 percent disabling, for a combined rating of 100 percent.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt for the Veteran, the remodel of the stair entrance was necessary to provide access to his home due to service-connected disabilities, to include CAD, mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy of both eyes, upper and lower extremity PN, weakness, moderate incomplete paralysis, and reduced vision; his claim would be approved by the committee.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for benefits under the HISA program for improvements to the entrance of the home have been met, subject to laws and regulations regarding payment.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107 (b), 1710(a), 1717; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 17.3100-3130.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from January 1966 to January 1970.  See DD 214.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals from a December 2024 decision of the Veterans Health Administration HISA program. 

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

The Veteran was notified that he has 60 days from the date the Board received his VA Form 10182, or one year from the date of the decision on appeal in which to switch dockets.   See March 2025 BVA Docketing Letter.  The Board notes that the Veteran waived his time to select a different Board review option.  See February 2025 Correspondence (containing hand-signed, and dated, form indicating Waiver of Time to Select a Different Board Review Option).  Therefore, the Board proceeds to the merits of the appeal.

1. HISA to remodel entrance to the home. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a HISA grant to remodel the entrance to his home from the garage.  See December 2024 VA Form 10182.  More specifically, he wishes to install handrails on either side of the stairs and replace the astroturf carpet covering the stairs.  See id; see also HISA Application. 

One of the reasons the claim was denied, was because the consultant indicated that these improvements are not to address service-connected disabilities.  See HISA File, received March 2025, pg. 2.  The Board finds that this finding is based on an inaccurate factual premise, as the Veteran has service-connected PN in all four extremities, with weakness, decreased vision, and decreased sensation.  The Board considered remanding the claim for a new consult which considers these service- connected disorders.  However, the Board finds that for there is adequate evidence of record with which to decide the claim, as discussed below. 

HISA

VA may furnish medical services which VA determines to be needed to any veteran for a service-connected disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1710(a).  Needed medical services include home health services, found to be necessary or appropriate for the effective and economical treatment of the veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 1717 (a)(1).

As part of home health services, HISA benefits may be furnished to a beneficiary for home improvements and structural alterations up to certain listed amounts, in this case up to $6,800. 38 U.S.C. § 1717(a)(2)(ii).  The purpose of the HISA benefits program is to provide eligible beneficiaries monetary benefits for home improvements and structural alterations when such improvements and structural alterations: (1) are necessary for the continuation of the provision of home health treatment of the beneficiary's disability; or (2) provide the beneficiary with access to the home or with access to essential lavatory and sanitary facilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1717 (a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 17.3100(a).  Improvements and structure alterations simply for personal comfort or that make living outside a hospital more acceptable may not be furnished.  VAOPGCPREC 32-91 (Mar. 11, 1991).

For the purposes of the HISA benefits program (§§17.3100 through 17.3130), access to essential lavatory and sanitary facilities means having "normal use" of the standard structural components of those facilities.  38 C.F.R. § 17.3101. Essential lavatory and sanitary facilities mean one bathroom equipped with a toilet and a shower or bath, one kitchen, and one laundry facility.  Id.  Improvement or structural alteration means a modification to a home or to an existing feature or fixture of a home, including repairs to or replacement of previously improved or altered features or fixtures.  Id. 

The determination of what is necessary and what is not necessary to assure the continuation of treatment is a question of medical fact.  VAOPGCPREC 32-91 (March 11, 1991).  Such a decision, "at least in part, requires the exercise of medical judgment, e.g., whether the services are needed to assure continuation of effective and economical treatment for the veteran's disability."  VAOPGCPREC 6-2001 at paragraph 16 (Feb. 8, 2001).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 17.3120, to apply for HISA benefits, the beneficiary must submit to VA a complete HISA benefits application package.  A complete HISA benefits application package includes all of the following:

(1) A prescription, which VA may obtain on the beneficiary's behalf, written or approved by a VA physician that includes all of the following: (i) the beneficiary's name, address, and telephone number; (ii) identification of the prescribed improvement or structural alteration; and (iii) the diagnosis and medical justification for the prescribed improvement or structural alteration.

(2) A completed and signed VA Form 10-0103, Veterans Application for Assistance in Acquiring Home Improvement and Structural Alterations, including, if desired, a request for advance payment of HISA benefits.

(3) A signed statement from the owner of the property authorizing the improvement or structural alteration to the property. The statement must be notarized if the beneficiary submitting the HISA benefits application is not the owner of the property.

(4) A written itemized estimate of costs for labor, materials, permits, and inspections for the home improvement or structural alteration.

(5) A color photograph of the unimproved area.

VA will approve the HISA benefits application if: (1) the application is consistent with §§17.3100 through 17.3130, and (2) VA determines that the proposed improvement or structural alteration is reasonably designed to address the needs of the beneficiary and appropriate for a beneficiary's home, based on documentation provided and/or through a pre-award inspection of the home.  38 C.F.R. § 17.3125.

Application

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran meets the basic eligibility criteria for HISA benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1717(a), in that he has a service-connected disability rated at 50 percent or more under 38 U.S.C. § 1710(a) (setting out nine possible bases for eligibility for VA care).  The Veteran is service connected for CAD status post CABG at 100 percent disabling, depressive disorder associated with hypothyroidism at 50 percent disabling, mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy of both eyes associated with DM at 40 percent disabling, diabetic PN of the right and left upper extremity radial nerve at 30 and 20 percent disabling respectively, diabetic PN of the left and right sciatic nerve at 20 percent disabling each, DM at 20 percent disabling, diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve of the right and left lower extremity each at 20 percent disabling, tinnitus at 10 percent disabling, as well as bilateral hearing loss, scars, hypertension and erectile dysfunction each at 0 percent disabling, for a combined rating of 100 percent.  See September 2024 Rating Decision Code Sheet, pgs. 1-4.

A Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) January 2020 examination indicates that the Veteran's lower extremity PN decreased tendon reflexes and sensation of the bilateral sciatic and femoral nerve, moderate incomplete paralysis, intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias, and numbness.  See January 2020 VA Examination, pgs. 2-3.  A May 2024 VA Treatment Record (CAPRI) indicates that the Veteran underwent a radiofrequency ablation with fluoroscopy to treat pain related to his peripheral nerves.  See CAPRI, received June 7, 2024, pgs. 1-2.  The Veteran was noted to have loss of sensation in both feet in August 2023.  See CAPRI, pg. 12. The Veteran is also service connected for upper extremity radiculopathy of the radial nerves of both upper extremities at 30 percent disabling due to moderate incomplete paralysis.  See July 2023 VA Examinations.  A September 2021 physical medicine rehabilitation note indicates that the Veteran was ambulating with the assistance of a walker, has weak extremities, and is at a high risk for falls.  See CAPRI, received on April 3, 2025, pg. 1247.  In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a HISA application which indicates that he wants to improve the steps by putting up handrails to assist him from getting from the garage into his home.  See HISA Application dated August 2, 2024.  

The Veteran's request was initially denied because the reviewer determined that steps are not eligible for modification.  See HISA File, received March 5, 2025, pg. 4 (containing December 2024 Decision).  A July 2024 HISA consultation sheet also indicates that his request was not related to any service-connected disabilities.  See id. at pg. 2.  The department requested photos and an estimate in August 2024.  The Veteran provided the requested information in November 2024, and did not hear back from VHA.  In December 2024, he followed up on the status of his application noting this would assist him to enter his home.  See id. at pg. 7.   The Veteran also indicated that he felt the estimate of around $5,500.00 was too much money and enlisted someone else for $987.00.  See id.  

In an undated correspondence, the HISA department responded that the Veteran should not have completed the repairs before an approval was issued, and the individual would present his claim to the HISA team and would "reach out via phone tomorrow with a final decision."  Id. at pg. 15. The claim was denied.

Here, the Board finds the HISA consultation was based on an inaccurate premise.  The VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities result in weakness, decreased sensation, numbness, and decreased strength in his lower extremities, as well as upper extremities.  His request to put railings on each side of the stairs addresses these issues.  Additionally, it appears from the photos that he replaced the astroturf-style carpet, which appears to be plastic, with a low pile carpet, presumably to reduce his risk of slip and falls and risk of injury.  

Thus, his request is related to service-connected disorders.  As the HISA Consult is based on an inaccurate factual premise, it is entitled to little or no probative weight.  See c.f., Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (finding a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).  The records indicate he has difficulty with stairs, uses a walker, has peripheral neuropathy in all four extremities, and low vision.  The Veteran indicated he needed rails installed, and the steps upgraded.  The Veteran is competent to report that he had difficulty with stairs, and the Board finds him to be competent.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  He has credibly and consistently reported his need for these improvements; the Board finds no reason to question his credibility.

Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to his need for these upgrades to the entrance to his home. If the positive and negative evidence is evenly or approximately balanced, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine not for application).  Therefore, the HISA benefit to cover the expense of improvements to the entrance to his home, to include railings on both sides, and replacement of the carpet, is granted, subject to the lifetime limit under 38 U.S.C. § 1717, and laws and regulations regarding payment.
