ORDER

Entitlement to an allowance for an automobile or other conveyance and adaptive equipment, or adaptive equipment only, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

At the close of the evidentiary window, the Veteran did not have any service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing eligibility for financial assistance in the purchase of an automobile or other conveyance or automobile adaptive equipment are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3901, 3902, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.350, 3.808.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1976 to February 1977.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an allowance for an automobile or other conveyance and adaptive equipment, or adaptive equipment only

Financial assistance may be provided to an eligible person in acquiring an automobile or other conveyance and adaptive equipment, or automobile adaptive equipment only.  38 U.S.C. § 3902 (a)-(b).  Eligibility for financial assistance in the purchase of a vehicle or other conveyance and adaptive equipment is warranted where one of the following exists as the result of injury or disease incurred or aggravated during active service: (1) loss or permanent loss of use of one or both feet; (2) loss or permanent loss of use of one or both hands; (3) permanent impairment of vision of both eyes, meaning central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye, with corrective glasses, or central visual acuity of more than 20/200 if there is a field defect in which the peripheral field has contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of visual field subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees in the better eye; (4) severe burn injury precluding effective operation of an automobile; (5) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; or, (6) for adaptive equipment only, ankylosis of one or both knees or one or both hips.  38 C.F.R. § 3.808.

Congress established the program authorizing funding for automobiles and adaptive equipment for veterans with certain service-connected disabilities.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3901-3904.  Pursuant to the authority established in 38 U.S.C. § 3902, VA promulgated 38 C.F.R. § 3.808, which reiterates the 38 U.S.C. § 3901(a) requirement that entitlement to automobile and adaptive equipment is warranted for the loss or permanent loss of use of one or both feet or one or both hands.  38 C.F.R. § 3.808 (b)(i)-(ii).  The regulation does not further define the phrase loss or permanent loss of use.  Under the applicable eligibility criteria for financial assistance in the purchase of an automobile or other conveyance and adaptive equipment, found 38 U.S.C. § 3901 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.808, the appellant must show that they lost a foot or hand or permanently lost the use of a foot or hand as a result of service-connected disability.

Loss of use is used in several places in the Rating Schedule.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  In the context of special monthly compensation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a)(2)(i), loss of use of a hand or a foot will be held to exist when no effective function remains other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation stump at the site of election below elbow or knee with use of a suitable prosthetic appliance.

A less restrictive definition is written into 38 U.S.C. § 2101 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.809 regarding specially adapted housing.  That regulation specifies that loss of use was defined by the adjacent modifier, such as to preclude locomotion without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair. Jensen v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 66 (2017).

However, that modifier is absent from 38 U.S.C. § 3901 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.808, and had Congress or the Secretary of VA wanted that definition to apply to these sections, it presumably would have been included.  Therefore, loss of use under 38 C.F.R. § 3.808 will be taken to mean actual loss of functional use of the body part, with any need of assistive devices being relevant to, but not dispositive of the question of whether the Veteran has permanent loss of use.

Analysis

As of December 28, 2023, the date the evidentiary window closed on the Veteran's appeal, the Veteran did not have any service-connected disabilities.

Eligibility for the benefit sought in this case requires the Veteran to meet at least one of the six criteria enumerated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.808.  Because the Veteran does not have a service-connected disability resulting in the loss or permanent loss of use of one or both hands or feet, does not have ankylosis of the knees or hips, and does not have any of the other physical disabilities listed among the relevant criteria, he does not qualify for eligibility for financial assistance in the purchase of an automobile or other conveyance or adaptive equipment under 38 C.F.R. § 3.808. Therefore, the claim must be denied.  The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran.  Therefore, the appeal must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
