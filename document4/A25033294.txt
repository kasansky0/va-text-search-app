ORDER

The deferred decision as to entitlement to compensation for throat and respiratory issues is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for Gulf War Syndrome is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The March 2023 deferral as to compensation for throat and respiratory issues is not an adjudicative action. 

2. The Veteran did not timely appeal the April 2013 rating decision which denied service connection for Gulf War Syndrome. 

3. Good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a notice of disagreement for the claim as to entitlement to service connection for Gulf War Syndrome.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The Board lacks jurisdiction to review the appeal of the deferred issue of compensation for throat and respiratory issues.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104(a), 20.105, 20.201.

2. The criteria for an extension for the filing of a VA Form 10182 for the Gulf War Syndrome claim are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 19.25, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1977 to July 1981; and December 1990 to June 1991. 

In the May 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

The deferred decision as to entitlement to compensation for throat and respiratory issues is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome is dismissed.

The Veteran filed a May 2023 10182 NOD to a March 2023, rating decision.  He indicated that he was appealing a denial of benefits due to Gulf War Syndrome, joint, muscle pain, and fatigue; and "sinus polyps, throat, and respiratory chronic issues."  A review of the March 2023 decision indicates the Veteran's claim for sinus cavity polyps was granted in the decision, and compensation for throat and respiratory issues was deferred.  

The March 2023 deferred rating decision as to entitlement to compensation for throat and respiratory issues does not constitute an adjudicative determination from which a NOD may be filed; thus, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the deferral, and it must be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104(a), 20.105, 20.201; Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011) (concluding that a deferred rating decision does not constitute an appealable adjudicative action). 

Also, the Veteran was granted service connection for sinus cavity polyps and allergic rhinitis in the March 2023 decision, so the Board does not interpret the May 2023 NOD to be an appeal of this grant.  Notably, he indicated on his NOD 10182 that he was appealing the denials. 

Further, there was no claim for service connection for Gulf War Syndrome, including joint and muscle pain, insomnia, and fatigue, that was adjudicated in the March 2023 rating decision.  The most recent decision that adjudicated a claim for this was in April 2013.  The notification letter in April 2013 that was sent along with the April 2013 rating decision notified the Veteran that he had one year from the date of the letter to appeal the decision.  However, he did not appeal the decision.  Therefore, the May 2023 appeal is untimely to the April 2013 decision. 

The Veteran was sent a January 2025 letter from the Board indicating that while his claim was docketed at the Board, his appeal request did not meet the necessary procedural requirements.  It was specifically indicated that the May 2023 VA Form 10182 was not received within the time allowed by law to the April 2013 rating decision.  To this date, the Board has not received any response to this untimely appeal letter.

Accordingly, this appeal must also be dismissed because neither the Veteran nor his representative have provided good cause for an extension of time to accept the Veteran's May 2023 VA Form 10182.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.  Whether good cause for an extension has been established is a determination made by the Board based on an explanation provided by the Veteran as to why the NOD could not be filed in a timely manner.  Id.  In this case, no such explanation has been provided for the Board to consider.  Accordingly, the attempted appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for Gulf War Syndrome is also dismissed.
