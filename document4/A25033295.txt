DOCKET NO. 210903-182211
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent disability rating, but no higher, for hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

From the date of his claim for service connection-January 7, 2020-the Veteran's hypertension resulted in continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 10 percent disability rating, but no higher, for hypertension have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to July 1971 and from April 1978 to May 1986.

This case is being reviewed according to the appellate process set forth under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA). This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with a VA decision on their claim to seek review.  This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an August 2021 rating decision of VA.  In his September 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket, pursuant to AMA.

The Veteran appeared at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in January 2025.  A transcript of the hearing is in the Veteran's file.  The Board notes that it may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the January 2025 hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). 

Increased Rating Claim

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

If the criteria and the facts are such that two different ratings are potentially applicable to the disability in question, the lower of those ratings must be assigned unless the veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating.?38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

However, in keeping with the VA's overarching pro-veteran approach to claim adjudication, if there is any reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability, that doubt will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

If the severity of a disability fluctuates over time, the VA may assign multiple ratings to cover different periods. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Breland v. McDonough, 22 F.4th 1347, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2022). See also, O'Connell v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 89, 93 (2007) (assigning multiple ratings is a "sensible mechanism" for ensuring precision while simultaneously accounting for the "dynamic nature" of a disability). This process is commonly referred to as "staging" the ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

When staging ratings, the VA considers the evidence pertaining to the entire period on appeal, assigns a rating to reflect the level of disability for each distinct period, and then assigns the effective dates for each rating. Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 127; Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509. The effective date of a staged rating generally corresponds to the date that level of disability initially became evident. Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).

The rating process begins when the VA grants service connection, and then assigns an initial disability rating. Once the initial rating is assigned, a veteran may pursue a higher rating by two different methods: (1) filing a timely appeal of the initial rating assigned to the disability based on a contention the AOJ erred in their evaluation of the veteran's disability, or (2) filing a new claim for an increased rating based on a contention the severity of their disability has increased since the initial rating. 

Here, the Board is presented with a hybrid of these two methods because the Veteran was granted service connection for hypertension in July 2020, and filed a new claim for a higher rating in April 2021, but because that claim for an increase was received within the one-year window after the decision assigning the initial rating, rather than using the date of the new claim to start the clock for the period on appeal, the Board extends the period on appeal back to the date of the original claim for service connection, January 7, 2020.

Hypertension is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.  By the criteria in that Diagnostic Code, a 10 percent evaluation is assigned when the evidence shows diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominately 160 or more, or as the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure of 100 or more which is controlled by continuous medication; a 20 percent evaluation is assigned where systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more, or diastolic pressure is predominately 110 or more; a 40 percent evaluation is assigned where diastolic pressure is predominately of 120 or more; and, a 60 percent rating is assigned when the evidence shows diastolic pressure predominately 130 or more.  The 60 percent rating is the highest available under the Diagnostic Code.  

The Board notes that the plain language of Diagnostic Code 7101 is atypical in that it expressly contemplates the effects of medication.  McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 273 (2016).

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

VA treatment records show blood pressure readings measured as 141/96 in March 2020 and as 161/106 in September 2020.  In February 2021, it was noted that the Veteran reported that his blood pressure readings taken at home averaged 120-130/80-90.

A May 2021 VA hypertension examination report shows that the Veteran took continuous medication, Losartan, for his hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension.  

The VA examiner noted that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more.  Upon examination, the blood pressure readings were measured as 140/80, 138/82 and 140/84.  A July 2021 VA hypertension examination report shows that the Veteran was taking medication for his condition and his blood pressure readings were measured as 150/95, 147/90 and 140/92.  

At his January 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran noted that he took medication for his condition.  Currently, he is taking a pill twice a day.  The Veteran reported several blood pressure readings, to include a February 2019 reading of 148/100, an April 2019 reading of 190/100, and October 2019 readings of 178/113 and 192/99.

In this case, when affording him the benefit of the doubt, the Board concludes that a 10 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's hypertension disability.  During the appeal period, his hypertension has required continuous medication for control indicative of a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7101.  Further, some of the blood pressure readings have shown to have a diastolic pressure of over 100.  

The medical evidence does not show that the Veteran's hypertension has manifested in diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more corresponding to the criteria for a 20 percent or higher disability rating under Diagnostic Code 7101.  

Accordingly, a 10 percent disability rating, but no higher, for the period on appeal is warranted.

Other Considerations

The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

Specifically, in Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), it was held that a claim for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is part and parcel of an increased rating claim when such is raised by the record.  

While the record reflects that the May 2021 VA hypertension examiner noted that the Veteran's condition impacted his ability to work because he could get easily fatigued, have headaches and experience dizziness and the July 2021 VA examiner noted that the Veteran could develop headaches, fatigue, or lightheadedness, there no evidence, medical or lay, showing that that the service-connected disability renders the Veteran unemployable.  Accordingly, a TDIU claim has not been raised, and no action pursuant to Rice is necessary.
