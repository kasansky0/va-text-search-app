REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the U.S. Marine Corps from October 1993 to September 1998.

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2021 decision.  In March 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2021 decision.

In the March 2022 rating decision, the RO granted a 70 percent rating effective August 10, 2018 and a maximum 100 percent rating from June 25, 2021 for his adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, panic disorder, and TBI. As this does grant does not constitute a full grant of benefits sought, the appeal remains before the Board.

In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. The December 19, 2024 Board decision, as it pertains to the grant of an initial 100 percent rating for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, panic disorder, and TBI, is vacated.

2. The December 19, 2024 Board decision, as it pertains to the grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) from August 10, 2018, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is vacated.

Motion to Vacate

The Board may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the appellant or his or her representative, or on the Boards own motion, when an appellant has been denied due process of law or when benefits were allowed based on false or fraudulent evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000 (a).

In this case, the December 2024 Board decision granted a 100 percent rating for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, panic disorder, and TBI.

As the December 2024 Board decision addressed evidence erroneously included in the Veteran's e-file, the Board vacates its December 2024 decision and will readjudicate the increased rating claim for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, panic disorder, and TBI and grant of SMC to afford the Veteran full consideration of the appeal before it. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000. 

The issues will be readjudicated below. 

3. From August 10, 2018 to June 25, 2021, a 100 percent rating for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, panic disorder, and TBI, is granted.

4. From August 10, 2018, special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted.

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a 70 percent rating from August 10, 2018 to June 25, 2021 for his adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, panic disorder, and TBI under DCs 8045-9440, governed by the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 70 percent evaluation is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

The maximum schedular rating of 100 percent is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

In addition, when evaluating a mental disorder, the rating agency shall consider the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the lengths of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission. 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a). The rating agency shall assign an evaluation based on all evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination. Id. However, when evaluating the level of disability from a mental disorder, the rating agency will consider the extent of social impairment but shall not assign an evaluation on the basis of social impairment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(b).

Symptoms listed in the General Rating Formula are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, which would justify a particular rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). Accordingly, the evidence considered in determining the level of impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is not restricted to the symptoms provided in the diagnostic code. Id. Instead, VA must consider all symptoms of a claimant's condition that affect the level of occupational and social impairment. Id.

Evidence

Turning to the relevant medical evidence, the Veteran has received ongoing treatment for his mental health disability with the VA. He was prescribed medication for his depression. Generally, he reported anxiety and panic attacks. See, e.g., July 2020 VA visit. However, he denied mania/hypomania, suicidal/homicidal ideations, plans or intent. Id. He denied auditory and visual hallucinations. Id.

In the May 2020 mental disorder VA examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression, chronic. The examiner concluded that he experienced occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or; symptoms controlled by medication. He experienced symptoms of depressed mood and anxiety. On observation, the Veteran was alert and oriented in all spheres. He was well groomed, pleasant, and cooperative. His mood was euthymic, and affect was mood congruent. A mild stutter in speech was observed. There was no disturbance in memory or thought process. Insight and judgement were fair. The Veteran denied suicidal or homicidal ideation at the time of interview. However, the examiner noted he had a history of suicidal ideation in February 2020. No hallucination or delusion was reported. The Veteran reported his TBI caused post-traumatic migraines. The migraines caused Veteran to miss work, causing fear of losing his job. He reported having marital problems due to his missing work. The examiner noted that the Veteran's fear of losing his job and marital problems were the stressors causing his adjustment disorder symptoms.

As to social history, the Veteran lived with his wife of 16 years. He reported marital difficulties due to his missing work frequently. The Veteran denied any difficulties with his step-children. He had regular contact with his mother but no contact with his brother in 5 years. He reported having good friends who are supportive.

As to work history, Veteran reported working for the Department of Human Services as an Information Technology technician since March 2017. The Veteran reported liking his job but fear that he has been calling out too many days and will run out of paid sick time. However, the Veteran reported that his supervisor is understanding. The Veteran that he will complete his 2nd master's degree in June for Information Management. The Veteran reported he was attending college part-time due to working a full time job.

In the August 2020 mental disorder VA examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression, chronic and panic disorder in addition to his TBI. The examiner concluded that he experienced occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. He experienced the following symptoms due to his mental disorder: depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks more than once a week, chronic sleep impairment, impairment of short and long term memory, flattened affect, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting), and suicidal ideation. The examiner noted that the Veteran was at an increased risk for suicide. On observation, the Veteran made good eye contact. His mood was depressed, and affect was flat. His short and long term memory were impaired. He had difficulty coming up with names, times, and dates. His speech was clear and pressured. His thought content was logical, and no psychotic thought was observed. The veteran reported suicidal ideations with no intent but was considered to be an increased risk of harm to himself.

The Veteran reported his TBI caused post-traumatic migraines. The migraines caused Veteran to miss work, causing fear of losing his job. He reported having marital problems due to his missing work. The examiner noted that the Veteran's fear of losing his job and marital problems were the stressors causing his adjustment disorder symptoms.

In the August 2020 TBI VA examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of TBI. The Veteran had a complaint of mild memory loss (such as having difficulty following a conversation, recalling recent conversations, remembering names of new acquaintances, or finding words, or often misplacing items), attention, concentration, or executive functions, but without objective evidence on testing. His judgment was normal. His social interaction was occasionally inappropriate. He was always oriented to person, time, place, and situation. His motor activity, visual spatial orientation, and consciousness were normal. He had no neurobehavioral effects. He was not able to communicate by spoken and written language (expressive communication) and to comprehend spoken and written language. He suffered from headaches but no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms. His subjective symptoms did not interfere with work; instrumental activities of daily living; or work, family or other close relationships, to include mild or occasional headaches, and mild anxiety.

As to social history, the Veteran reported that he lost multiple jobs, and his wife is very stressed due to financial stressors and has threatened divorce.

As to work history, he reported that he has worked in Information Technology and insurance and sales. The examiner noted that his anxiety and specific panic attacks which occur weekly were due to his headaches, job stress over possible poor job performance, and financial pressures and marital stress due to financial pressure.

Analysis

Based on the above, the Board finds that the Veteran's adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, panic disorder, and TBI symptoms more closely approximated total occupational and social impairment. 

While observations in his medical treatment records indicate that her symptoms are indicative of a 70 percent rating, the Board emphasizes that he experienced suicidal ideation. Moreover, he has experienced marital problems due to him missing work due to his TBI. See August 2020 VA examination. While he reported that his boss is understanding, missing work frequently caused marital stress. Thus, based on review of the Veteran's overall symptomatology, the Board finds that his adjustment disorder symptoms equate in severity, frequency and duration with total social and occupational impairment for the entirety of the appeal period. Therefore, the Board finds that a 100 percent disability rating for adjustment disorder is warranted for the entire appeal period.

Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)

The Court has held that VA has a "well-established" duty to maximize a claimant's benefits. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008). This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a claimant's disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008) (finding that SMC "benefits are to be accorded when a Veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim").

Special monthly compensation (SMC) is payable where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). Subsection 1114(s) requires that a disabled Veteran whose disability level is determined by the ratings schedule must have at least one disability that is rated at 100 percent in order to qualify for the special monthly compensation provided by that statute. Under the law, subsection 1114(s) benefits are not available to a Veteran whose 100 percent disability rating is based on multiple disabilities, none of which is rated at 100 percent disabling.

As a result of this decision, the Veteran's adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, panic disorder, and TBI is rated as 100 percent disabling for the entire period on appeal. For SMC purposes, this disability satisfied the requirement of a "service-connected disability rated as total." See Buie, supra; see also Bradley, supra. Because the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as total (i.e., adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, panic disorder, and TBI), and has additional service-connected disabilities that are independently rated as at least 60 percent disabling throughout the rating period on appeal, the criteria for SMC at the housebound rate have been met from August 10, 2018.
