ORDER

The November 18, 2024, request for an extension of time to file an appeal from a rating decision issued on February 15, 2019, that denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus is denied, and the attempted appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not timely file a Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) with respect to the rating decision issued on February 15, 2019, that denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The November 18, 2024 Board Appeal request is not timely with respect to the rating decision issued on February 15, 2019 that denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, and the criteria for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500(b), 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from Navy March 1970 to December 1973. He filed a November 18, 2024 Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on February 15, 2019 and selecting the Direct Review docket. 

Timeliness of an Appeal

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed NOD on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of an NOD shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C). 

An extension of the period for filing an NOD may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). 

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019). 

Timeliness of the November 18, 2024, with respect to the rating decision issued on February 15, 2019.

On November 18, 2024, the Veteran filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on February 15, 2019 that denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. The Veteran asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal. 

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the rating decision issued on February 15, 2019. 

The rating decision issued on February 15, 2019 denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. The Veteran was notified of the decision in a February 15, 2019, letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Veteran's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable.

The Veteran's November 18, 2024 Board Appeal request was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the rating decision issued on February 15, 2019. 

Although the Veteran has generally asserted that good cause exists for an extension to file an appeal, neither the Veteran nor his representative has provided an explanation for the delay in filing an appeal. The Veteran provided a statement attached to the November 18, 2024, Board Appeal request, but the assertions do not provide an explanation for why the Board Appeal request was not timely submitted or submitted earlier than it was. Instead, the Veteran's statement appears to provide assertions and contentions that relate to the underlying merits of the claims for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.

Accordingly, the November 18, 2024 Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the rating decision issued on February 15, 2019 that denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension request is denied, and the attempted appeal is dismissed.
