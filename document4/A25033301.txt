ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted from December 9, 2016, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for a TDIU, as she has been unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment due to her service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active-duty service in the United States Navy from September 1993 to April 1996.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2024 decision.  In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2024 decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted from December 9, 2016

The Veteran contends that she has been unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment since 2015 due to her service-connected disabilities.

VA will grant TDIU when the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of service-connected disabilities, from obtaining and maintaining any form of gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. TDIU is granted only when it is established that the service-connected disabilities are so severe, standing alone, as to prevent the retaining of gainful employment. If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at least 60 percent disabling to qualify for benefits based on individual unemployability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). If there are two or more such disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

Entitlement to a total rating must be based solely on the impact of service-connected disabilities on the ability to keep and maintain substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. The central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).

Where these percentage requirements are not met, entitlement to benefits on an extraschedular basis may be considered when a veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities, and consideration is given to the veteran's background including his employment and educational history. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (b), 4.16(b). The Board does not have the authority to assign an extraschedular TDIU rating in the first instance. Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1 (2001). Rather, the issue must be referred to the Director of Compensation Service for such assessment in the first instance. Kuppamala v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 447, 457 (2015). Thereafter, the Board has jurisdiction to review the entirety of the Director's decision denying or granting an extraschedular rating and is authorized to assign an extraschedular rating when appropriate. Kuppamala, 27 Vet. App. at 457.

For VA purposes, the term unemployability is synonymous with inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. VAOPGPREC 75-91, 57 Fed. Reg. 2,317 (Jan. 21, 1992). Consideration may be given to the veteran's education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his or her age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993). A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment, but the ultimate question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363.

The ability to work sporadically or obtain marginal employment is not substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991). Marginal employment, i.e., earned annual income that does not exceed the poverty threshold for one person, is not considered substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

Whether a veteran is unemployable requires the Board to "consider both that person's abilities and his employment history."  Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 354 (2000). But see Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 367 (2007) (holding that employer restrictions on driving due to insulin dependency does not constitute a regulation of activities).

Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  

The test of individual unemployability is whether the Veteran, as a result of her service-connected disability alone, is unable to secure or follow any form of substantially gainful occupation that is consistent with her education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. 

The Veteran is currently service-connected for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress rated as 30 percent disabling from August 6, 2014, 50 percent disabling from October 7, 2015, and 70 percent disabling from December 9, 2016; obstructive sleep apnea associated with unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress rated as 50 percent disabling from March 8, 2022; and lumbosacral strain with degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) (claimed as back condition) rated as 20 percent disabling from March 18, 2024. See April 2024 Codesheet. The Veteran's combined evaluation for compensation purposes is 30 percent from August 6, 2014, 50 percent from October 7, 2015, 70 percent from December 9, 2016, and 90 percent from March 8, 2022. As such, she has met the threshold criteria for a TDIU since December 9, 2016. The remaining inquiry is whether she is unable to secure or follow substantially gainful occupation due solely to her service-connected disabilities as early as December 9, 2016.

The Board first addresses the Veteran's employment after December 9, 2016. The Veteran reported that she last worked full time in May 2020. See August 2022 VA Form 21-8940. She reported that she was a full time case manager in 2013 at Family Endeavors, where her highest gross earnings per month were $2,240; a full time social worker at Parklands in 2013, where her highest gross earnings per month were $1,920; a case manager at Florida Baptist Children in 2016 for 27 hours per week in 2016, where her highest gross earnings per month were $1,408; a full time agent at Sitel in 2019, where her highest gross earnings per month were $1,200 and time lost from illness was 45 percent; and a full time social worker at Meridian Health in 2020, where her highest gross earnings per month were $2,000 and time lost from illness was 60 percent. Thus, as is relevant here, the Board must decide whether the Veteran's employment after December 9, 2016, fell below the national poverty line such that it did not constitute substantial gainful employment. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019).

The Veteran's work at Sitel in 2019 and Meridian Health in 2020 are assessed. In 2019, the poverty threshold for one person under 65 years was $13,300. See United States Census Bureau Website. In 2020, the threshold was $13,465. Id.

Although the Veteran did not provide specific dates of employment, the Board finds that, even assuming she consistently earned $1,200 per month for the entire year in 2019, the Veteran's earning fell below the poverty threshold due to time lost from illness. If the Veteran earned $1,200 per month for 12 months in 2019, she would have earned $14,400. However, because she lost 45 percent of that time due to illness, her earnings would come out to be $7,920 for the year of 2019, which is below the poverty threshold of $13,300. In 2020, she reported earning $2,000 per month, which would constitute $24,000 for the year. However, if the Veteran lost 60 percent of that time due to illness, she would have earned $9,600 in 2020, which is below the poverty threshold of $13,465. As such, the Board finds that the Veteran has not engaged in substantial gainful employment since December 9, 2016.

In her July 2022 statement, the Veteran expressed an ability to secure but not keep employment due to her medical symptoms and appointments. See July 2022 VA Form 21-8940. She reported that she is unable to maintain a job due to her triggers.

In a March 2019 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that her psychological disability makes it really hard to concentrate and perform at work. See March 2019 Hearing Transcript. 

In a July 2022 VA examination for mental disorders, the Veteran reported that she found it difficult to work and to go to school over the past few years. See July 2022 VA Examination. She stated that when she was in school for her Bachelors degree, she experienced a lot of depression. She stated that her depressive symptoms made it difficult to focus and maintain attention and concentration. The Veteran reported that she has worked sporadically over the past seven years as a Substance Abuse/Mental Health Counselor but stated that her own emotional and mental health issues would get triggered with dealing with the problems of others. She reported persistent depressive and anxiety symptoms, which have contributed to significant sleep problems and discomfort with leaving the house. She stated that she has a great deal of difficulty functioning normally when her emotional distress is high, and when she feels depressed and anxious. On examination, the Veteran's symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, near continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or work like setting, and inability to establish to maintain effective relationships.

The Veteran underwent a private psychological evaluation in September 2022. See September 2022 Private Medical Opinion. This examiner reviewed the Veteran's claims file and included references to pertinent treatment records. Specifically, she identified treatment records from June 2017 regarding the Veteran's alcohol consumption to calm her down and numb the feeling, as well as experiencing fear, lack of control, and frustration as triggering emotions she tends to want to escape or avoid. A July 2018 note indicated the Veteran's significant history of physical, mental, emotional, and sexual abuse both as a child and in the military. This clinician noted that the Veteran has intermittent depressive symptoms which can be contributed to the recent loss of her job. In June 2019, a mental health note documents reports of depression, guilt about not being able to maintain employment, chronic pain, irritability, feeling extreme fatigue, isolation, rumination about the past, rapid weight gain, and difficulty maintaining a self-care routine. The Veteran presented as tired and irritable. In the September 2022 interview, the Veteran presented with constricted affect and agitated, impatient mood. She spoke cautiously yet remained responsive to questions. Her level of distress was reported as severe since at least 2014. The Veteran described in detail her negative emotions and how they impact her ability to work. She indicated that she can work a job between six and eight months before she has to leave due to stress and an inability to function. She reported trouble with relationships, and lack of trust. She isolates but for two or three family members. The Veteran described instances when she became triggered at work, and how her anxiety and depression led to her termination. The examiner identified the Veteran's limitations such as issues sustaining concentration, difficulty managing anxiety symptoms, negative affect, low motivation, social isolation and difficulty tolerating interaction with others, low frustration tolerance and irritability, suicidal ideation, near continuous depression affecting her ability to function effectively, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances including work or work like setting, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, and intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living. These symptoms have resulted in limitations that have made it difficult for her to interact with others at work, stay on task, and be reliable and effective in a competitive work environment. The Veteran has significant difficulty with focus, concentration, and affect. Thus, given the severity and persistence of her symptoms as well as her inconsistent and sporadic work history, this examiner believes that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms alone have rendered her fully unable to sustain gainful employment since at least May 2021.

In July 2023, the Veteran was evaluated by a vocational expert. See July 2023 Private Opinion. In the interview, the Veteran enumerated her psychiatric symptoms, to include hypervigilance with suspiciousness toward others, a tendency to isolate and avoid the general public, anxiety with subsequent attacks, feelings of depression and hopelessness, and episodes of anger and irritability. She discussed her need to isolate as a coping mechanism on a daily basis. She reported feeling uncomfortable in public. Her hypervigilance, lack of motivation, depressed mood, and increased irritability and anxiety contribute to the Veteran's tendency to isolate. The Veteran's feelings of hypervigilance and suspiciousness of others rendered her distracted and unable to concentrate. The Veteran reported that she secures her home and has buzzer alarms on all her windows and doors. The Veteran described panic attacks whenever she leaves her house because she cannot control the situations outside her home. Her panic attacks render her unable to concentrate and leave her fatigued, lasting for about 15 minutes. The Veteran also endorsed unprovoked irritability and anger. She reported that she feels depressed at least three out of the 12 months per year, due to her thoughts and feelings. She reported difficulty sleeping due to anxiety and nightmares, which leads to fatigue during the day. The Veteran reported napping daily for 45 minutes but remaining tired. The Veteran reported difficulty concentrating on tasks and remembering new information. The vocational expert noted that during the interview, the Veteran frequently veered off topic when providing responses to questions, requiring redirection and repetition of questions. The Veteran reported that she has all her groceries delivered to avoid going out shopping. She indicated that things have gotten worse, and she has difficulty leaving her house.

The Veteran enumerated the jobs she held intermittently. The vocational expert opined that these jobs should be considered unmaintained, failed work attempts, and inconsistent with substantially gainful employment. The vocational expert further opined that the Veteran was limited to working in only these aforementioned unmaintained capacities due to the limitations from her psychiatric condition. The vocational expert concluded that, due to her service-connected unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress, the Veteran has been unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment, regardless of skill or exertional level, since at least December 2016 forward. The vocational expert explained that all employers in the competitive labor market require basic expectations to be met by their workers, regardless of the skill or exertional level of the position. Employees are only allowed to be off task 10 percent of the day or less. The vocational expert opined that the Veteran has been unable to satisfy the above standards of adequate pace, productivity, reliability, and interpersonal workplace communication due to symptoms associated with her unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. The vocational expert supported this opinion with excerpts from the Veteran's treatment records.

Regarding the Veteran's other service-connected disabilities, an August 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea does not impact her ability to work. See August 2023 VA Examination.

Service-connected lumbosacral strain with degenerative disc disease other than IVDS is not considered, as the condition became service-connected effective March 18, 2024, which is after the appellate period ends. See April 2024 Codesheet.

Evaluating the totality of the evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress renders her unable to secure or maintain substantially gainful employment. The combination of her symptoms of depression, anxiety, irritability, paranoia, compulsive behaviors, and fatigue from lack of quality sleep would impact her reliability and productivity and result in diminished work performance and absences that would not be tolerated by an employer. The Board affords great probative weight to the July 2023 vocational expert opinion. This expert, more so than a medical professional, has the qualifications and experience to assess the Veteran's employability considering her service-connected disabilities.

As such, when weighing the evidence in favor of and against the Veteran's claim, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted effective December 9, 2016, as this is the earliest date on which the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran met the requirements of 4.16(a) and was unable to secure or maintain substantially gainful employment. In short, the Board has resolved reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that a TDIU is warranted from December 9, 2016.
