ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating for degenerative arthritis with spinal stenosis and lumbar disc displacement in excess of 10 percent is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating for hypertension in excess of 10 percent is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's degenerative arthritis with spinal stenosis and lumbar disc displacement is manifest by forward flexion of 70 degrees and combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine of 170 degrees.

2. During the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating for degenerative arthritis with spinal stenosis and lumbar disc displacement in excess of 10 percent have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating for hypertension in excess of 10 percent have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.104, DC 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1955 to June 1957 and August 1981 to August 1989.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the modernized review system, or Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2024 decision. In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2024 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 decision.

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to a disability rating for degenerative arthritis with spinal stenosis and lumbar disc displacement in excess of 10 percent is denied.

The rating decision on appeal granted an earlier effective date of March 26, 1999 for the service-connected degenerative arthritis with spinal stenosis and lumbar disc displacement at 10 percent disabling. The Veteran indicated he was seeking an increased rating in his Board notice of disagreement. See March 2025 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement.

In general, disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disabilities adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set for the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589(1991).

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss every piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or on his behalf. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claims and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claims. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).

In increased rating claims, where a claimant seeks a higher rating for a previously service-connected disability, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58(1994).

The Veteran seeks a disability rating higher than 10 percent for his service-connected degenerative arthritis with spinal stenosis and lumbar disc displacement. The service-connected condition is rated under Diagnostic Code 5242. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA's Schedule, 38 C.F.R. Part 4, was amended with regard to rating musculoskeletal disorders. Fed. Reg. 76453 (November 30, 2020) (codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a).

When a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or appeal, the version more favorable to the veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. VAOPGCREC 3-2000; Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The revised musculoskeletal regulations do not provide for retroactive application; thus, the amendments may be applied as of, but not prior to, February 7, 2021. Hence, VA has made clear that its intent is that the claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied. For applications filed on or after the effective date, only the new criteria will be applied. Here, as the Veteran's claim was pending prior to February 7, 2021, the Board will consider entitlement under the prior regulations as well as the updated regulations from February 7, 2021, forward, applying the most favorable criteria for the Veteran.

The changes effective February 7, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5242 and 5243 were not to the rating schedule itself but added instruction to classify disabilities associated with IVDS under DC 5243 and all other intervertebral disc disabilities under 5242. As such, DC 5242 now reflects "Degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (also, see either DC 5003 or 5010)"; DC 5243 now reflects "Intervertebral disc syndrome: Assigned this diagnostic code only when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve route; assign diagnostic code 5242 for all other disc diagnoses." As such, the changes do not impact the general rating formula and evaluation of the disability under the pre- and post- February 7, 2021, regulations are not required.

In considering the Veteran's claim, to obtain the next higher disability rating 20 percent, the evidence of record must indicate forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees, or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees, or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5242.

The Veteran was first afforded a VA examination in July 1999. The examiner noted the Veteran's forward flexion was 90 degrees with pain beginning at 70 degrees. The combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine was 210 degrees. See July 1999 Compensation and Pension Exam Report.

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in January 2024. The Veteran's forward flexion was 70 degrees. The combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine was 170 degrees. It was noted the Veteran had localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour. See January 2024 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

Therefore, the evidence of record shows the Veteran's forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine was not less than 60 degrees nor did he have a combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine less than 120 degrees. Additionally, he did not have muscle spasms or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait. Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran is not entitled to an increased rating of greater than 10 percent for his degenerative arthritis with spinal stenosis and lumbar disc displacement, and this appeal must be denied.

2. Entitlement to a disability rating for hypertension in excess of 10 percent is denied.

The rating decision on appeal granted an earlier effective date of March 26, 1999 for the service-connected hypertension at 10 percent disabling. The Veteran indicated he was seeking an increased rating in his Board notice of disagreement.

In increased rating claims, where a claimant seeks a higher rating for a previously service-connected disability, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58(1994).

The Veteran seeks a disability rating higher than 10 percent for his service-connected hypertension. The service-connected condition is rated under Diagnostic Code 7101. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

Under the rating criteria, hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension) warrants a 60 percent rating when diastolic pressure is predominantly 130 or more. A 40 percent rating is warranted when diastolic pressure is predominantly 120 or more. A 20 percent rating is warranted when diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more. A 10 percent rating is warranted when diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or as a minimum rating for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.

In considering the Veteran's claim, to obtain the next higher disability rating of 20 percent for hypertension, the evidence of record must indicate diastolic pressure readings predominately 110 or more or systolic pressure reading predominantly 200 or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.

The Veteran was first afforded a VA examination in July 1999. At the exam, the Veteran had diastolic pressure readings of 100 and 96. His systolic pressure readings were 150 and 150. See July 1999 Compensation and Pension Exam Report.

The Veteran was afforded a second VA examination in January 2024. At the exam, the Veteran had diastolic pressure readings of 80, 86, and 88. His systolic pressure readings were 140, 152, and 142. See January 2024 Hypertension Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

There are numerous blood pressure readings in the Veteran's records. They all had a diastolic pressure between 68 and 102. They all had a systolic pressure between 103 and 188. See VA Medical Center Records Volume 1, 2, and 3.

Therefore, the evidence of record shows the Veteran's diastolic pressure was not predominately 110 or more nor was his systolic pressure reading predominantly 200 or more. Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran is not entitled to an increased rating of greater than 10 percent for his hypertension, and this appeal must be denied.
