ORDER

Entitlement to special monthly compensation for loss of use of a creative organ is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The September 2024 rating decision represents a full grant of the benefits sought with respect to the claim for special monthly compensation for loss of use of a creative organ. 

2. The evidence weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran's hypertension is related to his service, to include her toxic exposure risk activities.

3. The evidence weighs persuasively against finding a current diagnosis of sinusitis.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to special monthly compensation for loss of use of a creative organ have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sinusitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1990 to February 1993.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in September 2023 and December 2023 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 and December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of right knee arthritis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to special monthly compensation for loss of use of a creative organ is dismissed. 

Pursuant to applicable law and regulation, the Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. 

As the September 2024 rating decision represents a full grant of the benefits sought with respect to the claim for special monthly compensation (SMC) for loss of use of a creative organ, there remains no case or controversy before the Board as to that issue. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  

Moreover, the January 2024 rating decision denying partial hysterectomy, loss of use of creative organ, was adjudicated as a service connection claim.  Thus, an issue of effective date for SMC becomes a downstream issue from the adjudication of the increased rating claim for endometriosis in the September 2024 rating decision.  If the Veteran wishes to challenge the effective date, she must continuously pursue that issue or appeal within one year of the September 2024 rating decision.  

Consequently, the Board has no jurisdiction to review the issue, and the appeal for special monthly compensation for loss of use of a creative organ must be dismissed.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.  Entitlement to service connection requires evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The VA administers the law under a broad interpretation resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

The Veteran contends that her hypertension is a presumptive condition due to her exposure while serving in Saudi Arabia and Colorado. See May 2023 VA Claim.

Service treatment records are silent for high blood pressure readings, complaints of hypertension, or a diagnosis.

The Veteran is currently diagnosed with hypertension and has been since 2017.  See July 2023 VA Examination Report.

Service records show that the Veteran served in Kuwait from June 1, 1991, to June 30, 1991.  As such, the Veteran is covered under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.317 and 3.319 to meet element two, an "in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury." See Shedden, supra.

The remaining inquiry is whether the Veteran's hypertension is related to her service.

The Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran's hypertension is related to her service, to include her toxic exposure risk activities.

To that end, in a September 2023 VA examination, the examiner rendered a negative opinion, reasoning that according to medical literature, hypertension "is most likely the result of numerous genetic and environmental factors." In this case, "the Veteran has positive risk factors of hx of alcohol use, obesity, and smoking. These risk factors outweigh TERA exposures."  The Board assigns great probative weight to this opinion as the examiner considered the evidence of record and supported the conclusion with a thorough and well-reasoned explanation.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).

There is no positive medical opinion evidence of record.

The Board has considered whether the Veteran warrants service connection under a direct basis, however, there are no in-service complaints or diagnoses by which to link the disease to.

The Board has considered whether the Veteran warrants service connection under a presumptive basis.  However, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest within one year of separation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) for chronic disease presumption. Rather, her diagnosis of hypertension first occurred in 2017.  See September 2023 VA Examination Report. 

Additionally, the Veteran's diagnosis of hypertension is not contemplated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 as a disability due to undiagnosed illness and medically unexplained chronic multi symptom illnesses since there is a diagnosis with a clear etiology. See id.

Finally, the Veteran's diagnosis of hypertension is also not contemplated 38 C.F.R. § 3.320, to be eligible for presumption based on exposure to fine particulate matter.

Concerning the Veteran's statements that she has hypertension due to toxic exposure, the Veteran has not shown that she has the specialized education, training, or experience to diagnose the claimed disability. While lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, the diagnoses and etiologies of hypertension are complex medical matters in the field of medicine that fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Thus, the Veteran's lay statements have minimal probative value, and the medical findings have a greater probative value.

In conclusion, the evidence weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran's hypertension is related to her service, to include her toxic exposure risk activities. Thus, the appeal must be denied.  As the evidence is persuasive, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is denied.

The Veteran contends that her sinusitis is a presumptive condition due to her exposure while serving in Saudi Arabia and Colorado. See May 2023 VA Claim.

The Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively against finding a current diagnosis of sinusitis.

To that end, in a July 2023 VA examination, the examiner found a current diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, but did not find a current diagnosis of sinusitis.  Moreover, the Veteran was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis in a November 7, 2021, VA treatment record, but VA treatment records are silent for a diagnosis of sinusitis. 

The Veteran was awarded service connection for allergic rhinitis in the September 2023 rating decision, and that issue was not appealed.

Concerning the Veteran's statements that she has sinusitis, the Veteran has not shown that she has the specialized education, training, or experience to diagnose the claimed disability. While lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, the diagnoses and etiologies of sinusitis are complex medical matters in the field of medicine that fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Thus, the Veteran's lay statements have minimal probative value, and the medical findings have a greater probative value.

In conclusion, since the Veteran is already service-connected for allergic rhinitis and the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding of a current diagnosis of sinusitis, the appeal must be denied.  As the evidence is persuasive, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for right knee arthritis is remanded.

The Veteran contends that she has right knee arthritis due to an "event/time in service."  See May 2023 VA Claim.

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of right knee strain.  See December 2023 VA Examination Report.

VA must provide the veteran with a medical examination and secure a nexus opinion in connection with a claim for service connection when there is evidence of a disability and evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during active military service, but that evidence is not sufficient to grant service connection for the disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a). However, no examination is required if the Secretary has determined there is no indication of an association between the claimed disability and a TERA. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b).

In the sub-regulatory guidance, VBA found a lack of scientific evidence indicating a relationship between toxic exposure and conditions such as blunt force trauma, repetitive use trauma, or penetrating trauma. See VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-12.

In December 2023, a toxic exposure risk activity opinion was obtained.  There, the examiner rendered a negative opinion reasoning that "all musculoskeletal conditions are directly related to wear/tear and/or injury to the mentioned joint."

The Board finds that the December 2023 VA opinion is inadequate as the opinion was for TERA, rather than a direct basis for service connection.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (Once obtained, an exam must be adequate).  Moreover, VA opinions must not use the wrong standard or miss theories of entitlement.  See id. Since the AOJ provided the Veteran with an exam, it was required to obtain the correct medical opinion.  Here, the AOJ obtained a TERA opinion, despite the sub-regulatory guidance exception for trauma related injuries.  This was a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

On remand, the AOJ must obtain a direct medical opinion as to whether the Veteran's right knee strain is related to her service.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to address the claimed right knee strain.  The examiner must address the following:

(A) Opine whether the Veteran's right knee strain is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to her service.
