ORDER

An initial increased rating, higher than 40 percent, for degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome, is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU), is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome symptoms, has not more closely approximated unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine or entire spine or its functional equivalent; or resulted with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least six weeks during the past 12 months.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Throughout the period on appeal, the criteria for an initial increased rating, higher than 40 percent, for degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.10, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5242-5243.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army on active duty for less than three months, from May 15, 1974, to August 5, 2974.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2022 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the August 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 decision on appeal.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for entitlement to TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R.  § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. An initial increased rating, higher than 40 percent, for degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome, is denied.

The Veteran contends his service-connected degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome should be rated higher than 40 percent.  See November 2021 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application.

Disability ratings are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

When the Veteran is appealing the initial assignment of a disability rating, the severity of the disability is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  But if the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings, then separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found.  This practice is known as "staged" ratings and is employed for initial or established ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  There is no requirement that both medical and competent lay evidence is required to establish a claim; rather, competent lay evidence can be sufficient on its own to establish any element of a claim.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

It is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).

Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the Veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.")

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weightbearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  The spine has no opposite joint.

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the Veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

In this case, the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome is rated at 40 percent disabling, effective September 27, 2017, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5242 and 5243.  Disabilities rated under Diagnostic Codes 5242 and 5243 are rated under the General Rating Formula for Rating Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Rating Formula).

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 40 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.

A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.

A 30 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine 15 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine; or forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  The only higher schedular ratings under the General Rating Formula are 50 percent for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine and 100 percent for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.

Under Note (5) of the General Rating Formula, for VA compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching.  Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.

Alternatively, under the Formula for Rating intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes (IVDS Formula), a 60 percent disability evaluation requires incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least six weeks during the past 12 months.  Under Note (1) of the IVDS Formula, an "incapacitating episode" for purposes of totaling the cumulative time is defined as "period of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician."  Note (2) of the IVDS Formula provides that if IVDS is present in more than one spinal segment, provided that the effects in each spinal segment are clearly distinct, evaluate each segment on the basis of incapacitating episodes or under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, whichever method results in a higher evaluation for that segment.

Effective February 7, 2021, Diagnostic Code 5243 was amended to read: "Intervertebral disc syndrome: Assign this Diagnostic Code only when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve root; assign Diagnostic Code 5242 for all other disc diagnoses."  No other portions of the relevant Diagnostic Codes were amended.  As such, the February 7, 2021, amendments do not impact the Veteran's rating in this case. 

Consideration has been given to assigning a rating under the IVDS Formula Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician.  See August 2020 and April 2021 C&P Exams.  Consideration has also been given to whether the Veteran has ankylosis of the spine, including the functional equivalent of ankylosis, such that a higher rating would be warranted at any point for the period under review.  Examinations completed in 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022 determined the Veteran did not present any ankylosis of the spine symptoms.  Importantly, the Veteran has never been diagnosed with ankylosis, either during his routine treatment, or during the provided compensation and pension (C&P) examinations.  Furthermore, the Veteran has never been diagnosed with muscle atrophy, any neurological abnormalities, or other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to his degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome.  See December 2017 and July 2018 CAPRI, see also April 2021 and July 2022 C&P Exams.  

In July 2018 and July 2022, the Veteran reported no flare-ups associated with his degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome, however, in April 2021 the Veteran reported that once a month he does have a flare-up and is confined to a bed for a week.  The Board finds the Veteran's reported symptoms associated with his degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome are not the functional equivalent of ankylosis and do not more closely approximate a rating for ankylosis because the Veteran's symptoms do not result with time in a fixed position.  Moreover, there is no evidence that the Veteran experiences "difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching," unfavorable ankylosis symptoms pursuant to Note (5) of the General Rating Formula, for VA compensation purposes.

Therefore, the evidence of record indicates the Veteran's service-connected degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome symptoms, has not more closely approximated unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine or entire spine or its functional equivalent; or resulted with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least six weeks during the past 12 months, warranting a higher rating.  Accordingly, as the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating higher than 40 percent for the Veteran's service-connected degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to TDIU is remanded.

This claim for a TDIU was raised by the record as part and parcel of a supplemental claim filed on November 9, 2021, for an initial increased rating, higher than 40 percent, for degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome, effective September 27, 2017.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  Therefore, the appeal period for TDIU is the same as the appeal period for the claim for an initial increased rating for degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome.

A TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total and it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of either (1) a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

Where these percentage requirements are not met, entitlement to benefits on an extraschedular basis may be considered when the Veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities, and consideration is given to the Veteran's background including his or her employment and educational history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  The Board does not have the authority to assign an extraschedular TDIU in the first instance.  Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1 (2001).

By way of background, in February 2021, shortly after establishing service-connected degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome, the Veteran filed a claim for entitlement to TDIU.  In a July 2021 rating decision, the AOJ proposed the Veteran's service-connected degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome rated 40 percent disabling be decreased to 10 percent and denied the accompanying TDIU claim.  While this proposed rating reduction was being considered, the Veteran filed the November 9, 2021, supplemental claim for an initial increased rating for degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome and included argument that the Veteran is entitled to TDIU based on his degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome, also claimed as a low back condition.

In the subsequent August 2022 rating decision, currently on appeal, the AOJ decided the Veteran's service-connected degenerative arthritis of the spine with intervertebral disc syndrome rated 40 percent disabling should be continued.  However, the AOJ in the August 2022 rating decision, did not address or readjudicate the Veteran's TDIU claim.  Effective September 27, 2017, to present, the Veteran established a combined 50 percent service connection rating and does not meet the threshold criteria for eligibility for entitlement to TDIU.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In August 2021, the Veteran's representative provided a vocational assessment that asserted it is more likely than not that the Veteran has been unable to secure and follow substantial gainful employment due to the Veteran's service-connected disabilities.  While the Veteran does not meet the threshold criteria for eligibility for entitlement to TDIU pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), TDIU may also be awarded on an extraschedular basis.  However, the Board may not do so in the first instance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b); see Floyd v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 88, 9495 (1996).

The Board finds the evidence of record, to include the vocational assessment and the Veteran's statements of how his symptoms affect him, provide a reasonable possibility that the Veteran became unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities at some point during the appeal period.  That evidence was of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  Thus, the criteria for referral of the appeal for entitlement to a TDIU, to the Director, Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration were met prior to the AOJ decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b); see also Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019).  However, because no such referral was completed, the Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and the issue must be remanded so that it may be referred to the Director, Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for TDIU is remanded so that it may be referred to the Director, Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Refer the issue of entitlement to TDIU on an extraschedular basis to the Director of Compensation Service to determine whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities warrant the assignment of TDIU on an extraschedular basis pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).
