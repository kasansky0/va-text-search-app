DOCKET NO. 231119-393818
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

An earlier effective date of April 6, 2016 for a 50 percent rating award for service-connected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The approximate balance of the evidence supports finding the Veteran has continuously pursued this increased rating claim since a filing received within a year of discharge and that entitlement to a higher 50 percent rating was manifested prior to discharge.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria are met for an earlier April 6, 2016 effective date for a 50 percent rating award for service-connected OSA. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b) (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (Code) 6847 (2025).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from April 2010 to April 2016. This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision, reviewing a June 2022 rating decision, and appealed by a timely November 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) electing the Direct Review docket. Given the Veteran's docket election, the Board will consider the evidence of record as of the June 7, 2022 decision on appeal.

1. An earlier effective date of April 6, 2016 for a 50 percent rating award for service-connected OSA

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If the claim is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date will be the date following service separation or the date entitlement arose. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are: (1) intent to apply for benefits; (2) identification of the benefits sought; and (3) communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); see also MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the plain language of the regulations requires a claimant to have intent to file a claim for VA benefits).

Here, the Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for a 50 percent rating award for OSA. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Code 6847 provides that a 50 percent rating is awarded where OSA requires use of breathing assistance devices, like a continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine.

A review of the evidence shows that an initial March 2016 VA examination report prior to active duty discharge shows the Veteran underwent a sleep study and that the sleep specialist recommended a CPAP machine, but the Veteran had not yet obtained one. Therefore, the Board initially concedes that entitlement to the 50 percent rating based on requirement of a CPAP machine arose before discharge. 

Procedurally, the Board notes the Veteran initially filed for service connection for OSA prior to discharge, in December 2015. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) awarded service connection in July 2016, and the Veteran thereafter filed a January 2017 VA Form 21-526EZ (Fully Developed Claim) seeking a higher rating for OSA in January 2017. 

Although the AOJ sent a letter later in January 2017 indicating he needed to file either an appeal of the initial rating assigned in July 2016, submit "new evidence related to the previously denied/decided issue," or identify a clear and unmistakable error in the prior decision before they would take any action on the claim, they provide no citation to a legal authority barring the January 2017 filing from being considered a new claim for increase as opposed to a continuation or appeal of a previously decided issue.

After that letter, the Veteran did not respond directly and submitted nothing specifically relevant to OSA until an April 2021 Fully Developed Claim again requesting an increased rating for OSA. This time, the AOJ adjudicates the claim as a new claim for increase and denies it in May 2021. The Veteran then filed a timely March 2022 Supplemental Claim contesting that denial, and the AOJ granted a higher 50 percent rating in June 2022, effective April 7, 2021 (the date VA received the more recent Fully Developed Claim). From there, the Veteran filed a May 2023 Request for Higher-Level Review contesting the effective date of that 50 percent rating within a year of the June 2022 decision, which led to the HLR decision currently on appeal.

As a threshold matter, the Board notes the Veteran has continuously pursued this claim since the issuance of the May 2021 rating decision denying an increased rating for OSA. Moreover, the Board can find no basis for prohibiting the January 2017 filing from being considered a new claim for increase, particularly as the AOJ subsequently does exactly that for the April 2021 Fully Developed Claim, which is procedurally an identical form and filing to the earlier January 2017 one. Therefore, the Board here finds the May 2021 rating decision represents the first time the AOJ adjudicated the increased rating claim for OSA since the January 2017 Fully Developed Claim and, given the continuous pursuit since that time, the date of claim for purposes of this analysis is January 24, 2017 (the date VA received that initial Fully Development Claim following the initial grant of service connection in July 2016). 

Crucially, the January 2017 filing is still within a year of discharge from service, and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) provides that effective dates in claims of increase may be awarded up to one year before the date of claim provided there are medical records indicating an increase in the disability on appeal. Here, that requirement is clearly satisfied as the March 2016 VA examination report clearly indicates entitlement to a 50 percent rating based on the requirement alone (and, notably, not actual use) of a CPAP machine. However, it is worth noting that the disability on appeal has an original effective date of April 6, 2016 (the day after separation from active service). The Board here may not grant an effective date preceding that initial effective date, and the Veteran notably did not contest and has not since contested that April 6, 2016 effective date for the initial service connection award. However, given the date of claim and when entitlement arose, the Board finds the relevant statutory and regulatory law directs that the appropriate effective date for the 50 percent rating on appeal is April 6, 2016. Moreover, given that is the day after discharge from service, it is the earliest effective date available under the law for the disability on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). Thus, this is a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal.
