ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's current left shoulder condition did not onset in, nor was it caused by, active-duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1986 to August 2006.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for his left shoulder condition most recently addressed in a June 2022 rating decision.  In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires: (1) a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

For certain chronic diseases, service connection may be granted if the disease becomes manifest to a compensable degree within one year following separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

With chronic disease shown in service (or within the presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307), to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected unless they are clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. When the disease identity is established, there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity. Continuity of symptomatology is required only where the condition noted during service (or in the presumptive period) is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned. When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, the Secretary must give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107. The benefit of the doubt doctrine applies "if the competing evidence is in 'approximate balance.'" Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). However, "the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply" when the evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal'" and "the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other." Lynch at 781-782.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records from 1986 to 2003 are unavailable. When service treatment records are lost, missing, or destroyed, VA has a heightened duty to assist and must inform the Veteran and his representative that he can submit "alternate" sources in place of his missing service treatment records. See Dixon v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 261, 263 (1992). See also Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 371 (2005). VA notified the Veteran via letter that his service treatment records were unavailable for review. The July 2007 letter to the Veteran requested that the Veteran submit any evidence in his possession including personal copies of his service treatment records as well as statements from other individuals with personal knowledge of the Veteran's claimed in-service injuries. The Board, therefore, finds that VA fulfilled its heightened duty to assist with regard to the Veteran's missing service treatment records. 

In the November 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ found that the Veteran had a current disability (left shoulder degenerative arthritis) and that there was an in-service injury or event (January 2005 left shoulder strain). The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

Thus, the Board turns to the final element of service connection, the connection, or nexus, between the in-service events and the current condition, which the Board finds has not been met in this case. 

The Veteran attended a VA examination in March 2022. In that examination, the Veteran stated that his left shoulder condition began in 2002 and described stiffness and soreness when he would work out or load supplies onto the ship. This is consistent with the Veteran's statement in the July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ that his left shoulder injury was related to his working in the supply division onboard U.S. ships. The Veteran described his current symptoms as stiffness and limited range of motion in the left shoulder. The March 2022 VA examiner found that the Veteran had degenerative arthritis of the left shoulder but opined that this condition was unrelated to the Veteran's in-service shoulder strain, which was acute in nature. In support of the finding that the Veteran's in-service shoulder strain was acute, the examiner cited the absence of continued symptomatology of a left shoulder condition since that time. There is no other medical opinion of record regarding the etiology of the Veteran's shoulder condition.

Therefore, the Board finds the evidence is persuasively opposed to a finding that there is a link, connection, or nexus between the Veteran's current left shoulder condition and his in-service duties or any in-service event. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes his work in the supply division caused or is otherwise related to his current left shoulder condition, however, the Board finds that the Veteran is not competent to link his activities in service to the current condition because he lacks the requisite medical training or experience. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board has also considered application of the presumption concerning chronic conditions such as arthritis. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309.

The Veteran's service treatment records reflect that the Veteran denied a history of left shoulder pain until January 2005. In his January 2005 Report of Medical History, the Veteran endorsed what was later (in August 2006) noted by the examining physician to be a history of left shoulder strain. See Service Treatment Record. The Veteran denied joint and/or shoulder pain in, for example, December 1991, November 1993, July 1998, March 2002, October 2005 and June 2006 service treatment records. Therefore, the evidence is persuasive that the Veteran did not have a chronic left shoulder condition in service. 

Moreover, the Veteran filed for compensation for service-connected disabilities upon separation. He did not list a left shoulder condition at that time. With this application, the Veteran did provide his August 2006 Report of Medical History in which he had endorsed a history of painful shoulder, elbow, or wrist. This weighs against a finding that the Veteran's left shoulder disability manifested within a presumptive period following separation from service.

The Veteran separated from service in 2006 and, despite providing private treatment records dating back to 2011, the first evidence of a post-service left shoulder condition in the claims file was over 15 years later at the March 2022 VA examination. The Veteran's private treatment records from January 2011 to March 2023 are associated with the claims file. None of these treatment records contain complaint of shoulder pain or discomfort. Rather, the Veteran consistently had normal musculoskeletal findings on examination or review of symptoms. See, e.g., May 2015 Private Treatment Record. Therefore, there is no evidence that the disability manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service nor that symptoms of a left shoulder condition have continued since service. The Board finds that the presumption afforded to chronic conditions does not apply because the condition was not chronic in service, did not manifest within a presumptive period, and has not shown any continuity of symptomatology since separation from service.  

The Board has also considered additional presumptions available to the Veteran by virtue of his service in Southwest Asia; however, they do not apply to the Veteran's claimed shoulder condition. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1117, 1119; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.317, 3.320.

Under the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 ("PACT Act"), examinations and opinions are mandated in certain situations. However, that provision does not apply if the claimed condition is based on physical trauma, like the shoulder condition in this case. See 89 Federal Register 51224 (June 17, 2024); VBA Letter 20-24-06, at page 12 (June 12, 2024). Therefore, there is no basis upon which to order a remand for a medical examination/opinion under the PACT Act. 

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition, to include left shoulder strain and/or degenerative arthritis of the left shoulder have not been met. The Veteran has a diagnosed left shoulder condition and did experience left shoulder strain in service; however, the evidence is persuasive that the left shoulder condition was not chronic in service, did not manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service, and is not etiologically related to an in-service event or occurrence. Therefore, service connection is denied.
