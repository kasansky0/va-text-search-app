DOCKET NO. 240605-450058
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal, regarding whether the reduction of VA non-service-connected (NSC) pension benefits effective May 1, 2024 was proper, is dismissed.  

FINDING OF FACT

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was notified that the appellant died March 2025, and the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received official confirmation the same month.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the appellant, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of this appeal at this time.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Marine Corps from February 1972 to February 1974.  

The Veteran died in March 2025 and there are currently no pending substitution requests since that time.  

This case had arrived before the Board on appeal from a May 2024 decision by the VA Regional Office (RO) reducing VA pension benefits, which the appellant had disagreed with by filing a June 2024 VA Form 10182, opting for a direct docket at the Board.  

Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the appellant died during the pendency of this appeal.  As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths.  Therefore, this appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.  

There are, however, provisions in place to allow for an eligible person to take a claimant's place in an appeal in order to get a final decision.  This process is called substitution.  The request to be substituted must be filed within one year of the death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(b).  

As of this time, no one has requested substitution for the present appellant.  Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant."  If the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) receives a request for substitution within one year of the appellant's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).  The form and filing instructions are available online at: https://www.va.gov/find-forms/

Please note that only certain persons are eligible for substitution.  A person eligible for substitution includes "a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section 5121(a) of this title...."  38 U.S.C. § 5121A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a).  Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include a Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).  There is a helpful factsheet that explains who is eligible for accrued benefits here: https://benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/factsheets/general/Accrued.pdf
