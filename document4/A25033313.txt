ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), to include anxiety condition and sleep disturbances, is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), to include anxiety condition and sleep disturbances, that began during active service or otherwise was caused by service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force from January 2012 to May 2023.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claim, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

1.  Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110.

To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran believes that he has an anxiety disorder and a disability characterized by sleep disturbances that began during service or otherwise were caused by service.  As an initial matter, the Board notes that a September 2023 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) (claimed as sleep disturbances, anxiety condition, and depression).  As such, the claim currently before the Board will be limited to consideration of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia).  

In April 2012 and August 2013, the Veteran denied anxiety, sleep disturbances, or other sleep complaints.  Later during service, however, the Veteran had numerous complaints of anxiety and sleep problems.  For example, by October 2015 the Veteran had been treated for sleep disturbances, including snoring, gasping for air, and daytime somnolence for the past 10 years.  In November 2018, the Veteran had an unspecified insomnia disorder that he did not believe was related to depression or anxiety.  In January 2019, the Veteran sought treatment for low mood and insomnia that had been present for as long as he could remember, but was compounded by his work schedule.  The diagnosis was primary insomnia.  In March 2019, the Veteran had symptoms that included depression, anxiety, and guilt over his divorce.  A July 2019 diagnosis was adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  In December 2020, the Veteran discussed sleep problems during several days in the past 2 weeks.  In August 2021, an anxiety screening was negative.  In November 2021, the Veteran's sleep was improved and his depression in remission.  The assessment included anxiety disorder, unspecified.  In August 2022, the Veteran had impaired sleep, with difficulty starting and staying asleep.  In November 2022, the Veteran noted continued use of medication for sleep problems, although his depression was in remission.  In January 2023, the Veteran was treated via a sleep class through the mental health clinic.  Another January 2023 record noted a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, unspecified.    

In his January 2023 claim for VA compensation benefits, the Veteran indicated that he believed that sleep disturbances and an anxiety condition were related to his military service.

In February 2023, the Veteran reported dissatisfaction with his sleep pattern and he was diagnosed with primary insomnia.  The treatment provider indicated that the Veteran's complaints had improved, but the remaining symptoms "may be related to sleep apnea given his body habitus.  Additionally pain and an upper respiratory infection limited his sleep in the past month."  The Veteran overall, however, reported that he was sleeping well.

A February 2023 VA general medical examination report included a positive depression screen.  At that time, the Veteran also reported sleep apnea, including snoring, from 2015.  The examiner, however, noted that the Veteran had not been diagnosed with sleep apnea.  

A February 2023 VA sleep apnea examination report indicated that the Veteran did not have and had never had sleep apnea.  The Veteran reported symptom onset in 2015 that included gasping for air, nighttime snoring, and daytime fatigue.  The symptoms had remained the same since 2015.  The examiner concluded that there was no objective evidence on examination on which to base a diagnosis of sleep apnea.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in September 2023.  The examiner diagnosed only persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia).  The examiner specifically stated that the Veteran did not have more than one mental disorder diagnosed.  Symptoms associated with the diagnosed persistent depressive disorder included anxiety and chronic sleep impairment.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of an anxiety disorder or a disability characterized by sleep disturbances and has not had a diagnosis of such disabilities at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  In reaching that opinion, the Board notes that a February 2023 VA sleep apnea examination report specifically concluded that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of sleep apnea.  Instead, the Veteran's anxiety and sleep disturbance symptoms have been specifically attributed to his persistent depressive disorder by the September 2023 VA examiner and were contemplated in the 70 percent rating assigned by the AOJ for that disability, rather than as separately diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorders.  

The Board acknowledges the holding in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), in which the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Id. at 1367-69.  In this case, however, there is no lay or medical evidence to suggest functional impairment due to the anxiety and sleep disturbance symptoms not already contemplated by the 70 percent rating assigned for the diagnosed persistent depressive disorder.  See Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393 (2020) (holding that although in Saunders the Federal Circuit did not limit the definition of "disability" to pain, with respect to psychiatric disabilities VA has expressly limited compensation to disabilities conforming to a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis).

While the Veteran believes he has current anxiety and sleep disabilities, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the opinions of the VA medical professionals of record.

The Board concludes that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, and that service connection is not warranted.  As such, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim must be denied.  See generally Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed Cir. 2001).
