ORDER

The issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral flatfoot is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

1. In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 that disagreed with the denial of service connection for bilateral flatfoot in a June 2024 rating decision but, in July 2024, he also requested higher-level Review of that issue and rating decision. 

2. Service connection for bilateral flatfoot was granted in a July 2024 rating decision (issued in August 2024). 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral flatfoot have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2024 decision (issued in March 2024) that denied service connection for bilateral flatfoot. During HLR, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) identified a duty to assist error and, after additional development was conducted, the claim was readjudicated in the June 2024 decision on appeal. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket, which is the basis of this appeal. Indeed, in July 2024, the Board sent the Veteran a docketing letter acknowledging receipt of his June 2024 VA Form 10182; the letter also noted that the docket number assigned to this appeal was 240627-451992. 

However, in July 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher- Level Review (HLR), requesting review of the June 2024 decision that denied service connection for bilateral flatfoot. 

With respect to the denial of a claim, a claimant may either elect to submit a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or submit an appeal to the Board, but not elect multiple review options. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501. Such concurrent election is specifically prohibited by 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b), which states, "[A] claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option."

As noted, the Veteran initially submitted a VA Form 10182 as to the denial of service connection for bilateral flatfoot in the June 2024 rating decision but subsequently requested HLR of the same issue and rating decision. Because the Veteran may not seek review of an appeal while another review is pending final adjudication, the Board may not review the appeal resulting from the June 2024 VA Form 10182 and it must be dismissed based on improper concurrent election. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). 

In this context, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran submitted a statement requesting cancellation of the appeal assigned docket number 240627-451992, explaining that he was seeking entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus, i.e., flatfoot, under the HLR review process. See July 2024 Veteran statement.

Nevertheless, the Board notes that entitlement to service connection for bilateral flatfoot was granted by the AOJ in a July 2024 rating decision (issued in August 2024). As such, there remains no adverse determination stemming from the June 2024 rating decision on appeal and, therefore, dismissal is appropriate. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); see also Ramsey v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 223, 224-25 (2006); Bond v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 376, 377 (1992) (when the relief sought has been accomplished, the appropriate course of action is to dismiss the matter as moot).
