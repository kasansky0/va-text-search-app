DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hyperkeratotic build-up, right heel, is DENIED.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right heel hyperkeratotic build-up has been manifested by total body area of less than 5 percent, no exposed area, pain, and itching; but no formal treatment including no intermittent systemic therapy over the past 12-month period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable disability evaluation for hyperkeratotic build-up, right heel, have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7824.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from July 1975 to October 1997.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Legal Criteria - Increased Rating

The Veteran's right heel hyperkeratotic build up ("right heel skin disability") is rated under Diagnostic Code 7824, for diseases if keratinization (including ichthyoses, Darier's disease and palmoplantar keratoderma).  

VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018.  These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after August 13, 2018.  Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied.  The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

Effective August 31, 2018, VA regulations explicitly state that "systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin."  38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).

Additionally, effective August 13, 2018, a new General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to Diagnostic Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Under this formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.  

A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.  

A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  

A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.  Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability.  This rating instruction does not apply to DC 7824.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.

Analysis

The Veteran is seeking a compensable disability rating for his service-connected right heel skin disability.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under the August 13, 2018, regulations because the Veteran's right heel skin disability does not more nearly approximate characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or  at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.  

In November 2023 the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim Application seeking a compensable disability rating for his service-connected right heel skin disability.  The claim was denied in a March 2024 rating decision.  In an April 2024 VA Form 20-0996, he requested Higher-Level Review.  In an April 2024 rating decision, the RO again denied the claim.  The Veteran filed a May 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement perfecting the appeal before the Board.

The Veteran was afforded a VA skin conditions examination in November 2023, during which he described his right heel as itchy and can be painful.  The examiner noted that the Veteran does not seek any formal care for his condition.  Instead, he self-treats the condition by shaving the build up down every few weeks.  On examination, there was no evidence of treatment in the past 12 months.  The total body area affected was less than 5 percent, with no exposed area.  Symptoms of itching and mild pain were noted with no functional impact.

The Board does not doubt that the Veteran sincerely believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects.  The Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, to include pain and itching, and these reports are credible.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the Veteran does not assert, and medical treatment records do not show, that the right heel skin disability more nearly approximates the criteria for a compensable rating.  Here, the total body area affected is less than 5 percent, the criteria for a noncompensable rating. The Veteran has not reported, nor is there medical evidence of any treatment for his condition.  On the contrary, during the VA examination, he denied seeking any formal treatment for his right heel skin disability.

The Board has considered whether any other Diagnostic Codes related to disabilities of the skin would provide for a higher disability evaluation.  However, the evidence does not reflect that the Veteran's symptoms would warrant a higher rating under a different diagnostic code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable disability rating for right heel hyperkeratotic build-up.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable disability rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  The appeal is denied.
