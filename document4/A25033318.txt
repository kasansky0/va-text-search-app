DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 8, 2008, for the award of service connection for recurrent dislocation of the scapulohumeral joint, right shoulder degenerative joint disease and post-operative acromioclavicular joint separation (other right shoulder disability) is dismissed.

Entitlement to an effective date of April 22, 2011, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for left shoulder disability is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder (including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and antisocial personality disorder) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The May 2020 rating decision that awarded a separate 20 percent rating for recurrent dislocation of the scapulohumeral joint, right shoulder degenerative joint disease and post-operative acromioclavicular joint separation (other right shoulder disability), effective February 8, 2008 (date of receipt of claim) was rendered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) to implement a Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) order, and was not an appealable decision for purposes of additional Board review.

2. An informal application seeking service connection for left shoulder disability was received on April 22, 2011; there is no evidence of any unadjudicated formal or informal application for a left shoulder disability prior to that date.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the claim for entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 8, 2008, for the award of service connection for recurrent dislocation of the scapulohumeral joint, right shoulder degenerative joint disease and post-operative acromioclavicular joint separation (other right shoulder disability) have been met, as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7103, 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.

2. With reasonable doubt resolved in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to an effective date of April 22, 2011, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for left shoulder disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service from June 1989 to December 1989.

The Board acknowledges that this appeal has a lengthy procedural history, which will be discussed at length in another section. There are also different evidentiary windows for consideration.

In pertinent part, a November 2019 Board decision remanded the issues of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and left shoulder disability for development. It also granted entitlement to a separate rating of 20 percent for recurrent dislocation of the right scapulohumeral joint (other right shoulder disability), but did not assign an effective date.

During development, a May 2020 rating decision effectuated the Board's grant and awarded a separate 20 percent rating for other right shoulder disability, effective February 8, 2008 (date of receipt of claim). 

Additional development resulted in an April 2021 rating decision that granted entitlement to service connection for left shoulder disability with a 20 percent rating, effective January 23, 2012 (date of receipt of claim). 

More development resulted in the AOJ issuing an April 2021 supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) that denied entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder because that issue was previously in the Legacy appeal system. The Veteran opted the claim into the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), by submitting a June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.

In the June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. The issues listed were: 1) "PTSD claim"; 2) "Left shoulder, this injury was preexisting before I entered service"; and 3) "Right shoulder." Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2020 rating decision for other right shoulder disability and may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2021 rating decision for left shoulder disability. The Board may also only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2021 SSOC for acquired psychiatric disorder. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued these decisions, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, because the Board is remanding the service connection claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of it. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Finally, the Board has broadly recharacterized the Veteran's appeal to include consideration for all mental disorders. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (holding claimant seeking service connection for psychiatric disability who has no special medical expertise is not competent to provide diagnosis requiring application of medical expertise to facts, which include claimant's description of history and symptoms, and VA should construe claim for service connection based on reasonable expectations of non-expert claimant).

Earlier Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An exception is that the day following the date of separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose controls if the claim is received within one year after separation from active service; otherwise, the general rule applies. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). Claim means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). An initial claim is any complete claim, other than a supplemental claim, for a benefit on a form prescribed by the Secretary. The first initial claim for one or more benefits received by VA is further defined as an original claim. 38?C.F.R. §?3.1(p)(1)(i). Initial claims include a new claim requesting service connection for a disability. Id.

When there is a prior final decision in the claims file and a later readjudicated claim results in a grant of the benefit, the general rule for effective dates for readjudicated claims applies. In such cases the effective date cannot be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(h)(2).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that in order to be considered a valid claim, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.150, 3.151.

Prior to March 24, 2015, a "claim" was defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38  C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998). Any communication indicating intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA was considered an informal claim provided it identified, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. 38  C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). To determine when a claim was received under the relevant regulations prior to their recent amendment, the Board must review all communications that may be construed as an application or claim. Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992). Any communication or action that demonstrates an intent to apply for an identified benefit may be considered an informal claim. 38  C.F.R. § 3.155(a). Thus, the essential elements of a claim prior to March 24, 2015 are "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

Moreover, the Federal Circuit recently reversed the Court and held in Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2020) that a claim must identify the sickness, disease, or injury for which compensation is sought, with at least at a high level of generality, before VA's duty to assist in the development of the claim is triggered. 

Procedural History

A review of procedural history is necessary to determine effective dates for the claims on appeal.

The Veteran filed a claim for benefits in March 1993 and an August 1993 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for right shoulder disability. The Veteran did not appeal the decision, documentation constituting new and material evidence was not actually or constructively received within the one-year appeal period, and the decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c) (Supp. 1991); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103 (1993).

VA received another claim for right shoulder disability in November 1997. See November 1997 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

A November 1997 rating decision found that new and material evidence had not been received to reopen the service connection claim for right shoulder disability. The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement and a December 1997 statement of the case (SOC) also found that new and material evidence had not been received and continued the previous denial. The Veteran filed a timely appeal to the Board, but before a decision was rendered, a January 1998 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for degenerative joint disease right shoulder with history of AC separation (right shoulder disability) and assigned a 20 percent rating, effective November 6, 1997 (date VA received continuously prosecuted claim). 

The Veteran expressed disagreement with the 20 percent rating and a February 1998 SOC and April 1998 SSOC continued the 20 percent rating for right shoulder disability. He continued to seek a higher rating, but a February 1999 rating decision continued the 20 percent rating. An April 2000 rating decision proposed to reduce the right shoulder disability to noncompensable and a June 2000 rating decision decreased the right shoulder disability to noncompensable, effective September 1, 2000. 

The Board observes that the Veteran continued to seek a higher rating for his right shoulder disability. See also December 2000 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim; June 2001 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim; and February 2003 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. 

An April 2003 rating decision increased the Veteran's right shoulder disability from noncompensable to 30 percent, effective February 18, 2003 (date of receipt of claim). The Veteran expressed disagreement with this decision and an August 2003 SOC denied entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 18, 2003 for the grant of an increased 30 percent rating for right shoulder disability and he perfected an appeal to the Board. 

In August 2005, the Board denied entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 18, 2003, for a 30 percent evaluation for right shoulder disability.

On February 8, 2008, the Veteran requested an increased rating for his service-connected disabilities and also appeared to seek entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. See February 2008 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. 

A November 2008 rating decision continued the 30 percent rating for right shoulder disability and granted entitlement to service connection for residual right shoulder surgical with a noncompensable rating, effective February 8, 2008. It also denied entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. 

In December 2008, the Veteran filed another claim for benefits. A May 2009 rating decision continued the 30 percent rating for right shoulder disability and confirmed and continued the previous denial of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. 

A July 2009 rating decision also continued the 30 percent rating for right shoulder disability and confirmed and continued the previous denial of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. The Veteran expressed disagreement with these issues and a September 2010 SOC continued the 30 percent rating for right shoulder disability and continued the denial of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. He then timely perfected an appeal to the Board.

While his Board appeal was pending, the Veteran filed another claim for benefits in April 2011. In an April 22, 2011 statement from a prior representative, it was clarified that the Veteran was seeking entitlement to service connection for degenerative joint disease, an increased rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder (which he is not service-connected for), and a "disability secondary to right shoulder disability." See April 2011 Third Party Correspondence; see also April 2011 VA 21-526b, Veteran Supplemental Claim. 

VA also received an informal claim for benefits on January 23, 2012, wherein he requested an examination for his alleged left shoulder pain. See January 2012 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

A June 2012 rating decision continued the noncompensable rating for right shoulder scars and denied entitlement to service connection for left shoulder pain (left shoulder disability). 

A July 2012 SSOC continued the 30 percent rating for right shoulder disability (but noted there was improvement in the condition) and denied service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. The 30 percent rating for right shoulder disability was also proposed to be reduced to 10 percent in a July 2012 rating decision. 

A July 2014 rating decision then decreased the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder disability from 30 percent to 10 percent, effective October 1, 2014. 

Another July 2014 rating decision granted a temporary 100 percent rating for right shoulder disability based on surgical or other treatment necessitating convalescence. An evaluation of 30 percent was assigned from August 1, 2013 and a 10 percent rating was assigned from October 1, 2014. It also continued the previous denial of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder because the evidence submitted is not new and material. The Board notes that at the time of this decision, the Veteran's right shoulder disability was rated at 20 percent from November 6, 1997; noncompensable from September 1, 2000; 30 percent from February 18, 2003, 100 percent from May 30, 2013; 30 percent from August 1, 2013, and 10 percent from October 1, 2014. See July 2014 Rating Decision - Codesheet. 

An October 2015 SOC confirmed the decision to reduce the evaluation of the right shoulder disability, formerly evaluated as 30 percent disabling, to 10 percent disabling effective October 1, 2014.

In April 2017, the Board remanded the issues of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, entitlement to service connection for left shoulder disability, and entitlement to increases in the ratings for right shoulder disability (currently rated 30 percent prior to October 1, 2014, and 10 percent from that date, with an additional period of a temporary 100 percent rating for convalescence) for additional development. 

A June 2018 SOC denied entitlement to service connection for left shoulder disability and denied a compensable rating for right shoulder scar.

A January 2019 rating decision increased the Veteran's right shoulder disability from 10 percent to 20 percent, effective October 1, 2014. 

A January 2019 SSOC denied entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. It also denied entitlement to a rating more than 30 percent for right shoulder disability prior to October 1, 2014 and entitlement to a rating more than 20 percent thereafter. 

In November 2019, the Board restored a 30 percent rating for service-connected right shoulder disability, effective October 1, 2014 and denied a rating more than 30 percent for right shoulder disability prior to May 30, 2013 and from October 1, 2014. It also granted entitlement to service connection for recurrent dislocation of the right scapulohumeral joint with a 20 percent rating, but did not assign an effective date. The issues of entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder and a left shoulder disability were remanded for additional development. 

During development, a May 2020 rating decision effectuated the Board's grant and awarded a separate 20 percent rating for recurrent dislocation of the scapulohumeral joint, right shoulder degenerative joint disease and post-operative acromioclavicular joint separation (other right shoulder disability), effective February 8, 2008 (date of receipt of claim). It also restored a 20 percent rating for right shoulder disability, effective October 1, 2014.

Additional development resulted in an April 2021 rating decision that granted entitlement to service connection for left shoulder disability with a 20 percent rating, effective January 23, 2012 (date of receipt of claim). 

More development resulted in the AOJ issuing an April 2021 SSOC that denied entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder because that issue was previously in the Legacy appeal system.

In June 2021, the Veteran filed a timely appeal to the Board. See June 2021 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. 

An October 2022 rating decision found clear and unmistakable error in the assigned separate evaluation of recurrent dislocation of the scapulohumeral joint, right shoulder (under Diagnostic Code 5202) was clearly and unmistakably erroneous for the period between May 30, 2013 to July 31, 2013. Thus, an evaluation of 20 percent was assigned from August 1, 2013.

During the pendency of the current appeal, which was docketed at the Board in May 2023, the Veteran filed a concurrent election for the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for left shoulder disability under a different administrative review option, higher-level review. This resulted in an August 2023 rating decision that denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for the left shoulder disability. 

In March 2025, the Board dismissed the issue of entitlement to effective date prior to January 23, 2012, for the award of service connection for a left shoulder strain because it involved an impermissible concurrent election of an administrative review option. See March 2025 Board Decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 8, 2008, for the award of service connection for recurrent dislocation of the scapulohumeral joint, right shoulder degenerative joint disease and post-operative acromioclavicular joint separation (other right shoulder disability)

The Board briefly notes that the Veteran is service connected for: 1) right shoulder degenerative joint disease and post-operative acromioclavicular joint separation (right shoulder disability) under Diagnostic Code 5003-5201; and 2) recurrent dislocation of the scapulohumeral joint, right shoulder degenerative joint disease and post-operative acromioclavicular joint separation (other right shoulder disability) under Diagnostic Code 5202. 

Service connection for the right shoulder disability (Diagnostic Code 5003-5201) has been in effect since November 6, 1997 and ratings for it have been staged over time. It is currently rated 30 percent from August 1, 2013 and not on appeal. 

The issue currently on appeal concerns the Veteran's service-connected other right shoulder disability, which is rated as 20 percent disabling from February 8, 2008 under Diagnostic Code 5202. He contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for the grant of service connection for other right shoulder disability. 

By way of background, in November 2019, the Board restored a 30 percent rating for service-connected right shoulder disability, effective October 1, 2014 and denied a rating more than 30 percent for right shoulder disability prior to May 30, 2013 and from October 1, 2014. It also granted entitlement to service connection for recurrent dislocation of the right scapulohumeral joint with a 20 percent rating, but did not assign an effective date.

During development, a May 2020 rating decision effectuated the Board's grant and awarded a separate 20 percent rating for recurrent dislocation of the scapulohumeral joint, right shoulder degenerative joint disease and post-operative acromioclavicular joint separation (other right shoulder disability), effective February 8, 2008 (date of receipt of claim).

The May 2020 rating decision purportedly on appeal implemented the Board's decision and assigned an effective date of February 8, 2008 for other right shoulder disability. It stated:

Based upon the claim's unique facts found in the evidence of record in this case, the effective date is February 8, 2008. Entitlement to [a] separate evaluation has been established from the date the claim was received. When [a] separate evaluation is granted based on VA medical evidence showing a separate evaluation that exists within the scope of a service connected disability after the date the claim was received, the effective date is the date the claim was received.

To summarize, following the Board's November 2019 decision, the AOJ issued a rating decision implementing the Board's order in May 2020. In June 2021, the Veteran filed the instant appeal seeking entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 9, 2008 for the award of service connection for other right shoulder disability. However, a Veteran may not challenge the merits of a Board decision by expressing disagreement with the implementing rating decision. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); see also Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 31 (2023); Harris v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 345, 348 (2005). The May 2020 rating decision did not adjudicate any substantive issue on the merits of the Veteran's claim. As explained by the Court in the case of Encarnacion, "Because such actions are ministerial rather than adjudicative in nature, it is not possible to appeal a pure implementation of a grant of benefits; there is technically no "decision" to appeal." Encarnacion, 36 Vet. App. at 197. Moreover, as the Veteran's attempted appeal failed to present any allegation of error in either the Board's November 2019 order or the May 2020 implementing rating decision, it may not be construed as a motion for reconsideration or revision. See 38 U.S.C. § 7103 ("The decision of the Board determining is final unless the Chairman orders reconsideration of the decision").

The Board has considered the Court's language in the case of Calhoun v. McDonough, which discussed the issue of an allegedly free-standing earlier effective date claim and the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) language of a claim "continuously pursued." Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96, 101 (2024). The Court's analysis in that case addressed the issue of effective dates, noting that under the AMA, "section 5110 was revised to allow for an effective date as early as the initial application for benefits whenever the claimant continuously pursues a claim by filing, either alone or in succession" one of the identified additional claims proscribed within the statute. Calhoun, 37 Vet. App. at 101.

Included within 38 U.S.C. § 5110 is the ability for a veteran to file a supplemental claim within one year of a Board decision, pursuant to § 5108, where new and relevant evidence is presented in conjunction with such filing. In the Calhoun decision, the Court specifically addressed that the veteran filed a supplemental claim to a Board decision, not to a rating decision which implemented a Board order. Calhoun, 37 Vet. App. At 106. Unlike the facts in Calhoun, here, the Veteran filed an appeal to the Board of the May 2020 rating decision which merely implemented the Board's November 2019 decision. The Veteran did not file a supplemental claim as the facts in Calhoun were presented. As such, any appeal of the effective date assigned was premature at the time of the May 2020 rating decision that effectuated the Board's decision to grant service connection for other right shoulder disability. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d). As the attempted appeal in this case stems from the May 2020 AOJ decision implementing a Board grant, it is not a decision that the Board has the authority to review under 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). Therefore, as the instant appeal is not a valid appeal, there remains no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the appeal with respect to the claim for entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 8, 2008, for the award of service connection for other right shoulder disability is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 13, 2012, for the award of service connection for left shoulder disability  

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 13, 2012 for the award of service connection for left shoulder disability. Essentially, he contends that he continuously prosecuted an appeal for an increased rating for right shoulder disability and the left shoulder disability is secondary to, and therefore intertwined with, his service-connected right shoulder disability. As such, the Veteran believes that February 8, 2008 should be the proper effective date because that is the date service connection was awarded for his other right shoulder disability. 

The Board finds that the earliest effective date for the grant of service connection for left shoulder disability is April 22, 2011 for the following reasons.

Again, the Board notes that the procedural history of this appeal has been discussed at length above. Here, VA received an informal claim for benefits on January 13, 2012. In pertinent part, the Veteran claimed that his left shoulder was in pain and requested an examination. See January 2012 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

A June 2012 rating decision denied the claim for left shoulder disability. It stated that the evidence does not show an event, disease, or injury in service and the lay evidence submitted was not found to establish a nexus between the condition and military service. It also stated that the Veteran's service records are silent as to any complaints of or treatment for a left shoulder disability. See also June 2012 Notification Letter (e.g. VA 20-8993, VA 21-0290, PCGL. 

In November 2017 and November 2019, the Board remanded the service connection claim for left shoulder disability for additional development. 

During development, the April 2021 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for left shoulder disability and assigned a 20 percent rating, effective January 13, 2012 (date of receipt of claim). It stated that there are two medical opinions of record both for and against secondary causation for the claimed left shoulder disability, but reasonable doubt was resolved in the Veteran's favor. Notably, it also stated:

A review of the evidence of record shows that there has been doubt as to an official diagnosis of a disability associated with [the Veteran's] left shoulder. One VA examination, dated June 12, 2012, showed no diagnosis, but subsequent examinations showed a diagnosis based on [his] oral history. There are also records from when [the Veteran was] incarcerated showing treatment for left shoulder pain, which supports [his] contention that this disability has been present since [the] initial claim was received.

The Board will now address any relevant medical evidence regarding a left shoulder disability and look for an original claim for service connection for left shoulder disability prior to receipt of the January 13, 2012 informal claim.

During a November 1998 VA examination, the Veteran's left shoulder was evaluated and determined to be within normal limits.

In a March 2003 VA treatment note, the Veteran complained of left shoulder pain. Additional VA and private treatment records include notations for shoulder pain. 

The Veteran received a VA examination in March 2003, but it was for his right shoulder disability and the left shoulder was not assessed. 

During an August 2008 VA examination, the Veteran's left shoulder was normal and range of motion for it was used as comparison to the right shoulder, which was being evaluated at the time. 

At a June 2012 VA examination, the Veteran's left shoulder had normal range of motion and there was no diagnosis of a left shoulder disability. 

The Veteran received a VA shoulder examination in May 2018, wherein he was diagnosed with left shoulder strain (dated November 2013). He stated that his left shoulder "pops and clicks a lot" and he feels a burning sensation when doing pushups. The examiner reported that the Veteran does not have x-ray evidence of degenerative joint disease in the left shoulder and the left shoulder is otherwise fine, with no other symptoms. The examiner noted that the majority of the shoulder exam was not possible to perform due to prison security concerns. The examiner determined that that the Veteran's claimed left shoulder disability is less likely than not secondary to his service-connected right shoulder disability.

In an October 2020 VA opinion, the examiner determined that the Veteran's claimed left shoulder disability is at least as likely as not secondary to his service-connected right shoulder disability. 

The Veteran received another VA shoulder examination in April 2021, wherein a diagnosis of left shoulder strain was confirmed (dated 2011). The Veteran stated that in 2001, he was doing pushups and felt spontaneous pain in his left shoulder. It worsened over time and while he was in prison. Range of motion for the left shoulder was abnormal or outside of normal range.

The Board observes that there are also a number of medical records during periods in which the Veteran was incarcerated. These records include complaints of left shoulder pain as well.

Overall, the medical evidence of record shows that while the Veteran complained of occasional left shoulder pain, a formal diagnosis was not rendered until the May 2018 VA examiner diagnosed him with left shoulder strain (dated November 2013). 

Importantly, the Veteran filed a claim for benefits in April 2011. In an April 22, 2011 follow-up statement from a prior representative, it was clarified that the Veteran was seeking entitlement to service connection for degenerative joint disease and a "disability secondary to right shoulder disability." See April 2011 Third Party Correspondence; see also April 2011 VA 21-526b, Veteran Supplemental Claim. There are no other earlier informal claims for a left shoulder disability contained in the file. 

The Board finds that when sympathetically read, the Veteran's statement submitted in April 2011 can be construed as an informal claim seeking service connection for left shoulder disability. In the May 2021 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ discussed the conflicting evidence of record and resolved reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, finding that service connection for left shoulder disability is warranted with a 20 percent rating, effective January 23, 2012 (date of receipt of claim). The effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Based on the above, the Board finds that the Veteran met all requirements for eligibility for service connection for left shoulder disability as of April 11, 2011 and resolution of any reasonable doubt is conferred in the Veteran's favor. Since the effective date is the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, the earliest effective date is April 11, 2011. Accordingly, an effective date of April 11, 2011, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for left shoulder disability is warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder is remanded.

Review of the record reveals that remand is required in order to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the April 2021 SSOC on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Board reiterates that the procedural history of this appeal has been detailed above. There has also been substantial development conducted for this issue. 

Here, the November 2019 Board remand stated:

In its April 2017 Remand, the Board noted that the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder was certified for appeal to the Board prior to the effective date of the regulation requiring that the diagnosis of a mental disorder conform to the DSM-5. See 80 Fed. Reg. 14, 308 (Mar. 19, 2015). The Board requested that the RO obtain a VA examination to determine the diagnoses of any psychiatric disabilities found on examination, and specifically asked that the examiner rely on the DSM-IV (not the DSM-5) for diagnosing all psychiatric disabilities. While the Veteran underwent additional VA psychiatric examinations in July 2018 and December 2018, both examiners stated that they relied on the DSM-5 for diagnosis of the Veteran's psychiatric disorders. As such, a new examination was required. 

Pursuant to that remand, the Veteran received a VA examination in December 2020. The examiner determined that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that conforms to the DSM-5 criteria. Instead, the Veteran was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. The examiner commented that the Veteran's medical records do not support a diagnosis of PTSD and symptoms do not meet the criteria for diagnoses of anxiety, depression or bipolar disorder. The examiner also remarked that there is no diagnosis of PTSD because the information is vague regarding the alleged sexual assault incident that the Veteran reported and there are no clear markers because he did not report the incident. The examiner determined that the Veteran's claimed acquired psychiatric disorder is less likely than not related to service. The rationale was:

Medical records and remand were reviewed. Although he reported MST, there are no definite markers of an MST during the military or in the years right after his military service. He did not report the alleged MST. As a result, his symptoms do not meet the criteria under DSM 5 for PTSD.

In a December 2020 addendum, the examiner indicated that he reviewed the prior remand. It was noted that the Veteran had a history prior to his incarceration of polysubstance abuse and was released from prison in October 2020. The examiner stated that the Veteran had a history of anger and violent behavior while in prison and that his substance abuse and antisocial behaviors started prior to military service. The examiner clarified that the Veteran's symptoms meet both DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for antisocial personality disorder. The examiner concluded:

Individuals with antisocial personality disorder "tend to lie, break laws, act impulsivity, and lack regard for their own safety or the safety of others" as defined by DSM IV. There are no markers present to support a diagnosis of PTSD with MST, and the veteran did not report his alleged MST. Antisocial Personality Disorder is the appropriate diagnosis and meets both DSM IV and DSM 5 criteria for that diagnosis.

The Board observes that generally, personality disorders are not subject to service connection because they are not "diseases" or "injuries" under the meaning of applicable law and regulations for VA compensation purposes. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(c), 4.9, 4.127; see also Winn v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 510, 516 (1996). However, service connection may be granted, in limited circumstances, for disability due to aggravation of a constitutional or developmental abnormality (to include personality disorder), by superimposed disease or injury. See VAOPGCPREC 82-90, 55 Fed. Reg. 45,711 (1990).

Considering the above, the Board finds the December 2020 VA medical opinions to be at least partially inadequate for the purposes of determining service connection. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (holding that when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate); see also Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 298 (2008). Specifically, the examiner provided conclusory remarks with limited rationale and merely stated that the Veteran's antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse preexisted his active service. However, because the Veteran's September 1988 enlistment examination found the Veteran's psychiatric systems to be normal, the presumption of soundness applies, and clear and unmistakable evidence would be needed to rebut the presumption. 38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b). The VA examiner did not address whether there was clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse preexisted his active service.

When the Board identifies a pre-decisional duty to assist error, under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 20.802(a), the Board must remand the appeal back to the AOJ with instructions to correct the error. Therefore, remand is needed for an additional VA opinion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion authored by a VA examiner of appropriate expertise to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed acquired psychiatric disorder (including PTSD, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and antisocial personality disorder). The examiner is to be provided access to the Veteran's electronic claims file and must specify in the report that these records have been reviewed.

It should be noted that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he had first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology. If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation. The examiner should note that the standard is whether likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher.

(a) The examiner must opine whether the evidence of record, including the Veteran's lay statements and the Veteran's service records, corroborate the claim that a personal assault occurred in-service.

(b) After the review of the electronic claims file, the examiner should identify and state all acquired psychiatric disorders found. An explanation for any opinions expressed must be provided, and if the requested information cannot be provided without resort to speculation, the examiner should so state and explain why. The examiner is requested to evaluate the Veteran's claimed acquired psychiatric disorder under the DSM-IV criteria (not the DSM-5). If the Veteran does not meet the diagnostic criteria under the DSM-IV for any previously diagnosed psychiatric disorder, the examiner should identify the criteria that are not met and reconcile such findings with the diagnoses noted in the claims file.

(c) If the examiner does not find any acquired psychiatric disorder(s) or finds that a diagnosis of such is not appropriate, the examiner should give specific reasoning for that conclusion. If no disorder is found the examiner must express whether the disorder existed earlier in the appeal period and the examiner should clearly explain why the noted evidence does not establish a chronic diagnosis.

The examiner is advised that the Veteran's entrance examination does not show a psychiatric diagnosis or defect, and he is therefore presumed to have been in sound condition upon his entrance. The examiner is further asked to determine:

(d) Whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence that any acquired psychiatric disorder existed prior to service? The examiner should specifically cite to any evidence that supports that opinion.

(e) If any acquired psychiatric disorder existed prior to service, the examiner should state whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the preexisting disability did not undergo a permanent worsening beyond the normal progression of the disability. If there is, point it out. If there is not, then the examiner is asked to presume that he entered service without a pre-existing disability.

(f) If the examiner determines that the Veteran did not have a pre-existing acquired psychiatric disorder, the examiner should state whether the Veteran has an acquired psychiatric disorder that manifested in or is otherwise causally or etiologically related to his military service, to include any symptomatology therein and the claimed in-service personal assault.

(g) The examiner should state whether the Veteran's previously diagnosed antisocial personality disorder was subject to a superimposed injury or disease during service and whether that disorder is superimposed upon the psychiatric disorder resulting in additional disability.

In offering any opinion, the examiner must consider the full record. The examiner should also reconcile any prior report and expound on the December 2020 VA addendum opinion that the Veteran's "substance abuse started prior to the military as did his antisocial behaviors," as necessary, and provide a comprehensive rationale for the requested opinion. 

If the VA examiner determines that further examination is necessary in order to render any medical opinion, then the Veteran should be scheduled for such an examination.
