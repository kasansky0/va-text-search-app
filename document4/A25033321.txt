ORDER

FINDING OF FACT

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to accrued benefits in the amount of $200, but no greater, are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5121; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.57, 3.1000.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from August 1948 to March 1953. The Veteran has since passed. The appellant is the power of attorney for the Veteran's surviving son. 

The appellant's claim originates from a May 2023 notification letter issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO). Thereafter, the appellant requested a higher-level review (HLR) of that decision. In January 2024, the RO issued a HLR rating decision denying the appellant's claim. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Hearing docket. A July 26, 2024 notification advised the Veteran that a hearing was scheduled for November 2024. The appellant did not appear for the scheduled Board hearing.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran within 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing. 38?C.F.R. §?20.302(c). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date of the scheduled Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the date of the scheduled hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(c), 20.801. No additional evidence was submitted either way. 

Entitlement to accrued benefits greater than $1,087.00 is denied.

The appellant seeks reimbursement for all expenses paid in relation to a beneficiary's last sickness or burial.

Accrued benefits are those benefits to which an individual was entitled at the time of death under an existing rating or based on evidence in the file at the date of death. See 38 U.S.C. § 5121 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (a). Upon the death of a beneficiary, any accrued benefits are payable to a spouse, or to others if the spouse is not alive. 38 U.S.C. § 5121 (a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (a)(1). In order to be eligible for accrued benefits, the claimant must qualify as a member of one of the statutorily enumerated categories of recipients. Burris v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 348, 352-53 (2001).

Upon the death of a surviving spouse, accrued benefits are payable to the children of the deceased Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5121 (a)(2), (3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (a)(1), (2). For accrued benefits, the term child is defined, in pertinent part, as an unmarried person who is a legitimate child, a child legally adopted before the age of 18 years, a stepchild who acquired that status before the age of 18 years and who is a member of the Veteran's household or was a member of the Veteran's household at the time of the Veteran's death, or an illegitimate child; and (i) Who is under the age of 18 years; or (ii) Who, before reaching the age of 18 years, became permanently incapable of self-support; or (iii) Who, after reaching the age of 18 years and until completion of education or training (but not after reaching the age of 23 years) is pursuing a course of instruction at an educational institution approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 38 C.F.R. § 3.57 (a). See also 38 U.S.C. § 101 (4)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (d)(2).

In all other cases, accrued benefits may be paid only as necessary to reimburse the person who bore the expense of last sickness and/or burial. 38 U.S.C. § 5121 (a)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (a)(5).

The Veteran's surviving spouse died in September 2021. The appellant submitted a request for reimbursement of funeral expenses in August 2022 and these were granted in the amount of $1,087.00 in a May 2023 notification letter. However, the appellant desires reimbursement for other items, to include legal work for a "lady bird deed" ($1275.00) and the individual who led the memorial service ($200.00). While the legal fees were not considered valid last expenses, the memorial service was denied because VA "did not receive an itemized statement showing a breakdown of the fees associated with this memorial service." The appellant did not do so.

After a review of all of the evidence, the Board finds that the criteria for payment of accrued benefits of $200.00 to be met. 

As the appellant does not qualify as a child under 38 C.F.R. § 3.57, the only remaining means of disbursement is for reimbursement of expenses of the deceased beneficiary's last illness and burial. While the RO denied the claim because no "itemized statement" was submitted regarding the memorial service, the appellant did submit a copy of the service program for the service of remembrance for the Veteran's spouse. Further, the appellant submitted proof of payment. Thus, the criteria for reimbursement for last illness and burial have been met for that amount and the appellant is entitled to $200.00

As for the legal fees, the appellant has not shown how those fees are related to the beneficiary's last illness and burial. Accordingly, as the law controls and there is no dispute regarding the facts, the claim must be denied on that basis. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (where the law is dispositive, the claim must be denied due to a lack of legal merit).
