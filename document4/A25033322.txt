DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2021, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for the service-connected left shoulder, mild degenerative joint disease, based upon limitation of motion is dismissed.   

REMANDED

Whether there is clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in an August 2015 rating decision that assigned an effective date of April 17, 2015, for the award of service connection for left shoulder, mild degenerative joint disease, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has not alleged specific error of fact or law in the assignment of the October 28, 2021, effective date for the 20 percent rating for the left shoulder, mild degenerative joint disease, based upon limitation of motion. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2021, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for the service-connected left shoulder, mild degenerative joint disease, based upon limitation of motion are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1987 to May 1994 and from May 2004 to October 2006. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) has recharacterized the issue on appeal into the two separate issues as above to better reflect the allegations made by the Veteran.   

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of whether there is clear and unmistakable error in an August 2015 rating decision that assigned an effective date of April 17, 2015, for the award of service connection for left shoulder, mild degenerative joint disease, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2021, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for the service-connected left shoulder, mild degenerative joint disease, based upon limitation of motion  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. Here, the Veteran has never filed a claim or even submitted argument for an effective date earlier than October 28, 2021, for the assignment of an increased 20 percent rating for his left shoulder disability. This appeal arises from a claim filed on January 10, 2024, wherein the Veteran alleged there was CUE in the effective date assigned for the original award of service connection for his left shoulder disability in an August 2015 rating decision. It appears there was confusion with the Veteran's claim, all motions filed therewith, and all his and his representative's statements made during the pendency of this appeal, including in the August 2024 Notice of Disagreement, such that all have been interpreted as supporting a freestanding claim and appeal for an earlier effective date than that assigned in a December 2021 rating decision, which assigned an October 28, 2021, effective date for an increased 20 percent rating for the Veteran's left shoulder disability. 

Here, there is no case or controversy with respect to the docketed appeal for entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 28, 2021, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for the service-connected left shoulder, mild degenerative joint disease based upon limitation of motion, as the Veteran has not asserted such. Without any allegation of specific error of fact or law in the assignment of the October 28, 2021, effective date for the 20 percent rating for the service-connected left shoulder, mild degenerative joint disease based upon limitation of motion, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the matter and dismissal of this appeal is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Whether there is CUE in an August 2015 rating decision that assigned an effective date of April 17, 2015, for the award of service connection for left shoulder, mild degenerative joint disease

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board may remand for correction of any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 20 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Pursuant to the rules regarding claims for disability benefits, each specific issue listed on an application for entitlement to disability benefits will be adjudicated, and VA will issue a decision that addresses each such issue identified in a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(c)(1). The statutory provisions describing the procedures for adjudicating requests to revise prior rating decisions based on CUE provide that a claimant's request for revision of a decision based on CUE shall be submitted to the Secretary and decided in the same manner as any other claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A(e). To that end, each new theory of CUE is a separate and distinct matter, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over any theory of CUE that has not been adjudicated by the RO in the first instance. Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 332-33 (2006).

As the AOJ failed to adjudicate the CUE issue that the Veteran identified in his January 2024 CUE motion, the RO erred in satisfying a statutory or regulatory duty. Accordingly, a remand is required to correct this error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Adjudicate the issue of whether revision of the August 2015 rating decision is warranted on the basis of the Veteran's January 2024 CUE motion.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
