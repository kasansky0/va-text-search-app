ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

In a March 2, 2023, written statement, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board or BVA) received notification from the Veteran's representative requesting a withdrawal of the Veteran's December 22, 2022, VA Form 10182.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the claim on appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board notes that the Veteran's representative submitted a letter attempting to withdraw representation which was received on May 16, 2024.  However, the representative did not include an explanation of good cause, and the representative did not respond to the Board's request for withdrawal clarification.  See BVA Letter, Receipt Date: March 6, 2025.  Therefore, as no valid withdrawal has been effectuated, the Board finds that the attorney is still the representative of record.  38 C.F.R. § 20.6(a).

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his authorized representative.  Id.  

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn the issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, by withdrawing the December 22, 2022, VA Form 10182.  The withdrawal was effectuated by the Veteran's representative via a March 2, 2023, written statement, which is (1) explicit, (2) unambiguous, and (3) done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011); see Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
