ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral tinnitus began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1982 to June 1989.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In July 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for tinnitus most recently addressed in a May 2024 rating decision.  In September 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

As a final preliminary matter, generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has elapsed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows Veterans to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from the date the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, or one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless (1) a Veteran has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§?20.302 and 20.303, or (2) the Veteran or their representative has requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307. (2024).  If the Board issues a decision before this timeframe has elapsed - and does not otherwise find that the appellant waived the time to request a docket switch - the Board fails to afford the appellant due process.  In this case less than one year has elapsed since the Veteran was notified of the September 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, as the Board is granting the Veteran's claim in full, it would be nonsensical to hold this decision in abeyance as no prejudice will result from issuance of this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran asserts that his tinnitus began during active service.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Service connection does not require that a current disability be related to a particular exposure or any other causal agent in service, it only requires that a current disability had its onset in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) ("service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces"); Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) ("Congress has designed and fully intends to maintain a beneficial non-adversarial system of [V]eterans' benefits.  This is particularly true of service-connected disability compensation where the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty.")

During the adjudication of the present claim, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise while working as a technician in the Navy.  See May 2024 Rating Decision.  The AOJ further found that the Veteran has a current disability of tinnitus.  See September 2024 Rating Decision.

The Veteran first reported to his assigned ship in May 1984.  See July 2023 Military Personnel Record.  While serving on the USS Midway, an aircraft carrier, the Veteran was subjected to noise from catapults and jets as they launched or landed on deck, which was directly above his workshop.  The Veteran was not offered adequate hearing protection and noticed tinnitus immediately after being discharged from the ship to Japan.  See July 2024 Statement in Support of Claim.  It is unclear from this statement if the Veteran is referring to his 1989 discharge from active duty or to his 1986 detachment from his ship to a US Naval Hospital in Japan.  See July 2023 Military Personnel Record.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with this claim.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's in-service noise exposure was less likely than not the cause of his tinnitus.  In support of this conclusion, the examiner noted that the record does not show any complaints of tinnitus during service.  See August 2024 C&P Exam.

The VA's examiner seems to discount the Veteran's in-service onset of symptoms because they are not corroborated by service records.  However, the Board cannot determine that the lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Furthermore, the Veteran is competent to provide evidence of the symptoms of tinnitus and the time period of their onset.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  Because there is no evidence contradicting the Veteran's competent and credible assertion that his tinnitus began during active service, entitlement to service connection for bilateral tinnitus is warranted.
