DOCKET NO. 240926-477889
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On January 20, 2025, the Veteran withdrew his appeal for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1969 to October 1970.

In a September 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD. The Veteran appealed that decision in a September 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), and elected the Hearing Docket. 

However, in a VA Form 21-4138 received by VA on January 20, 2025, the Veteran withdrew the claim before VA.

As a preliminary matter, the Board acknowledges that, in October 2024, the Veteran submitted a Privacy Act request that was acknowledged in November 2024, but has not yet been fulfilled. However, because the Veteran subsequently requested to withdraw this appeal, the Board concludes that dismissal of this appeal prior to fulfillment of the Privacy Act request would not result in prejudice to the Veteran.

This appeal has been advanced on the docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id..

On January 20, 2025, the Veteran submitted a statement that he would like to withdraw his hearing request as well as the issue pending before the Board. Because the Veteran's September 2024 NOD listed only his PTSD claim, the Board understands the January 2025 statement to be a withdrawal of this issue - the only issue currently before the Board. The cover sheet attached to the statement also indicates that the statement is meant to operate as a withdrawal. This statement and its cover sheet contained all the necessary elements as required by 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

Thus, the Veteran has withdrawn the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD. There remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

This appeal has been appropriately withdrawn and it is dismissed.
