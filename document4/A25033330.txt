REMANDED

Entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for calendar year 2020 is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from May 1966 to May 1970.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2020 decision by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) that denied entitlement to a clothing allowance for calendar year 2020. In June 2020, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, as this matter is being remanded, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The record is missing a significant amount of documentation concerning a clothing allowance for calendar year 2020. The claims file does not contain a copy of the initial claims application, any applicable notice letters, VHA prosthetics records, or any pre-decisional evidence submitted or developed in relation to the claim. The substantive decision by the VHA is also missing from the claims file. 

As these pertinent documents are missing from the file, the Board does not have a complete record on which basis it can fulfill its statutory and regulatory duty to render a decision on the Veteran's claim. Therefore, remand is warranted for the AOJ to reconstruct the record and associate with the claims file all relevant clothing allowance records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Contact the Veteran and request that he provide relevant information/details and/or a copy of any documents (evidence and/or notices from VA) he may have in his possession concerning the claim.

A copy of the letter sent to the Veteran and documentation of any response received must be associated with the electronic claims.

2. Associate with the electronic claim file all evidence considered in connection with the claim on appeal.

The record should include (but is not limited to): the Veteran's application for a clothing allowance for 2020, the associated 2020 VHA decision, and any other relevant documents received or generated in connection with the claim, to include any VHA or prosthetics records.

3.  If any of the records sought are not available, the record should be annotated to reflect that fact, and the Veteran and his representative should be notified of: (a) the identity of the records VA was unable to obtain, (b) the efforts VA made to obtain the records, (c) any further action VA will take regarding his claim(s), including, but not limited to, notice that VA will decide the claim(s) based on the evidence of record unless the Veteran submits the records VA is unable to obtain, and (d) that the Veteran is ultimately responsible for providing the evidence.
