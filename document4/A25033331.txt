REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from March 2003 to March 2018.  

These matters are before the Board on appeal from a September 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rating decision, which denied service connection for deformity of the right thumb and thumb pain, dental and oral numbness/tingling, bilateral hip condition, left knee pain, lower back pain, migraines, polycystic ovarian syndrome, posttraumatic stress disorder, right knee pain, ringing in the ears, sleep apnea, and a spine disability.  In a September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.

In a March 2025 statement, the appellant indicated that she wished to withdraw the appeal she had submitted to the Board on September 16, 2024.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran unambiguously expressed her desire to withdraw the current appeal stream and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for the Board to consider in these matters.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it must be dismissed.
