REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 1993 to January 2002.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

Once VA provides an examination or obtains a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  A medical opinion is adequate "where it is based on consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and examinations and describes the disability, if any, in sufficient detail so that the Board's 'evaluation of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one.'"  Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007) (quoting Ardison v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 405, 407 (1994)).  Furthermore, an adequate and thorough examination must consider all other relevant evidence of record, including lay statements.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).  An adequate medical opinion does not contain only data and conclusions, "but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two."  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).  Ultimately, if an examination report does not contain sufficient detail, "it is incumbent upon the rating board to return the report as inadequate for evaluation purposes." 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; see Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 12 (2001) (emphasizing the Board's duty to return inadequate examination reports); Hicks v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 417, 421 (1995) (inadequate medical evaluation frustrates judicial review).

Here, the Veteran contends that her hypertension was caused by anxiety, and the Board notes that she is service connected for an acquired psychiatric condition.  In furtherance of the Veteran's claim, one VA medical examination was conducted and associated opinion obtained.  See December 5, 2023 C&P Examination.  In it, the examiner opined that the Veteran's hypertension is unrelated to her acquired psychiatric disability because "there is no known mechanism by which depression can cause idiopathic hypertension."   Further, the examiner indicated that hypertension is a consequence of interaction between environment and genetic risk factors and listed risk factors including salt consumption and low intake of fruits and vegetables.  However, the examiner failed to associate risk factors with the Veteran's specific facts.  Thus, the Board finds the opinion conclusory and inadequate for adjudicative purposes.

Additionally, the opinion failed ot address whether the Veteran's hypertension was directly related to active-duty service or whether the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric condition aggravated her hypertension.  A medical opinion regarding secondary service connection (which the Veteran claims) must address both causation and aggravation.  See El Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 140 (2013).  Failure to obtain an aggravation opinion amounts to a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Forward the Veteran's claims file to an appropriate VA medical examiner to issue a medical opinion regarding the Veteran's claim of service connection for hypertension.  The entire claims file, including a copy of this Remand, must be made available to, and must be reviewed by, the examiner providing the opinion.  If, and only if, the examiner determines that an examination should be conducted, one should be scheduled.  Thereafter, the examiner should address the following:

(a.)  Please state whether it is at least as likely as not (meaning the favorable and unfavorable evidence is in approximate balance or nearly equal) that the Veteran's hypertension was incurred in, caused by, or related to service.

(b.) Please state whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's hypertension is proximately caused by his service-connected acquired psychiatric disability.

(c.)  Please state whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's hypertension was aggravated by his service-connected acquired psychiatric disability.

The examiner should consider medical and lay evidence dated both prior to and since the filing of the claim in October 2023.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for any opinion rendered.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she should explain why an opinion cannot be provided (e.g., lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).
