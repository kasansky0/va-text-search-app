ORDER

Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, entitlement to an initial 50 percent rating, but no higher, for migraine headaches, effective December 9, 2022, is granted, subject to the laws and regulations government the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDING OF FACT

During the appeal period, the Veteran's migraines have been very frequent, completely prostrating, and involving prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial 50 percent rating, but no higher, for migraine headaches have been met. U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2011 to November 2012, January 2013 to January 2014, and April 2017 to April 2018, with additional time in the Reserve.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in October 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the rating decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance or nearly equal-which includes but is not limited to equipoise-the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply.  Id. at 781-82.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for migraine headaches.

The Veteran and his attorney-representative contend he is entitled to a 50 percent disability rating for migraine headaches, effective December 9, 2022. 

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history, and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Examination reports are to be interpreted in light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the veteran working or seeking work.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  All reasonable doubt will be resolved in the claimant's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Id. 

The appeal period before the Board for migraine headaches begins on December 9, 2022, the date of service connection.  The Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim regarding the issue on appeal within one year of the rating decision that granted service connection; there has been continual pursuit of the issue in appellate status. The migraine disability was rated as noncompensable from December 9, 2022, to July 30, 2023, and has been rated as 30 percent disabling from July 31, 2023, to present, pursuant to DC 8100. 

Migraine headaches are rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §4.124a, DC 8100, for migraine.  Under DC 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  A 50 percent rating is the highest schedular rating under DC 8100. 38 C.F.R. §4.124a.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation.  Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The rating criteria for a 50 percent rating contain several undefined phrases.  The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. at 253.  The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraine attack must render the veteran entirely powerless.  Id.  The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract."  Id. (internal citation omitted).  Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability."  Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 44546 (2004).

Turning to the evidence of record, in a December 2022 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran stated his headaches occur daily and the pain is around his temple region, on the back of his head, on the front of his head, on his forehead, and behind his eyes.  He contended that at least five to six times per month, the migraine headaches cause him to be "out of commission" to the point that he is totally incapacitated and unable to do any normal daily activities for six hours.  During his headaches the Veteran experiences light sensitivity, noise sensitivity, flashing or shimmering lights, nausea, numbness, weakness, vertigo, dizziness, lightheadedness, throbbing pain, and pulsating pain.  The Veteran asserted he missed two weeks of work due to his episodes in a 12-month timeframe.  Furthermore, the Veteran asserted he missed events and activities due to his headaches because they render him unable to function at all during the time of the headaches.

The Veteran was provided a VA examination in January 2023. The examiner noted that the Veteran had symptoms of constant pain, pulsating or throbbing head pain, pain on both sides of the head, and sensitivity to sound.  The examiner opined that the Veteran did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines productive of severe economic inadaptability, and that the Veteran's migraine headaches did not impact his ability to work.

In July 2023, the Veteran provided an independent evaluation for his migraine headaches.  Based primarily on the Veteran's December 2022 lay statements discussed above, the provider opined the Veteran experiences very frequent, completely prostrating attacks of migraine headache pain at least five to six times a month, and therefore meets the criteria for a 50 percent disability rating.

In September 2023, VA provided another medical opinion.  The provider noted the Veteran had symptoms of pulsating or throbbing head pain, pain on both sides of the head, worsening pain with physical activity, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound.  The provider noted that the duration of typical head pain lasted one to two days.  The provider opined that the Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks once every month.  Furthermore, the provider opined that the Veteran's migraine headaches impact his ability to work, because they affect his concentration.

The Board finds the Veteran's description of his symptoms and functional impairment, fully support that the Veteran's headaches are prostrating and productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Additionally, the Board notes that the Veteran reported having five to six migraines a month, and thus were more frequent than once a month as set forth in the VA examination reports and as set forth in the 30 percent criteria under DC 8100.

The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report his readily observable symptoms.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran's reports regarding the frequency and severity of his migraines were provided to VA with his initial December 2022 claim and are reflective of a history of uncontrolled, frequent prostrating migraines.  Accordingly, the Board finds his statements to be credible.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's attorney-representative's argument that the Veteran meets the criteria for a 50 percent rating and a corrected effective date of December 9, 2022, or the earliest date and rating allowed by law.  As previously addressed, 50 percent is the highest rating permitted under DC 8100.  Additionally, as the Veteran did not file a VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File, within one year prior to his December 2022 service connection claim for migraine headaches, the date of claim is the earliest effective date for migraine headaches allowed by law. 

In sum, the Board resolves all doubt in the Veteran's favor and concludes the Veteran's migraines have been very frequent, completely prostrating, and involving prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Therefore, a 50 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's migraine headaches from December 9, 2022.  The Board notes that a 50 percent rating is the maximum rating available under DC 8100.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. The Board does not find a basis for an initial rating in excess of 50 percent.
