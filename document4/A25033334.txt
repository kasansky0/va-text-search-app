REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating higher than 30 percent for a left total knee arthroplasty is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1968 to September 1972. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2022 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held in September 2023 before a Veterans Law Judge. A copy of the transcript of that hearing has been associated with the claims file. 

The appeal was denied in a January 2024 Board decision, and the Veteran appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In a November 2024 decision, the Court granted the parties' Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR). Per the Court's Order, the January 2024 Board decision was vacated as to the above-listed issue and has been sent back to the Board for action consistent with the JMPR.

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the November 2022 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing (i.e. until November 30, 2023). However, because the claim is being remanded, the AOJ will have the opportunity to review any evidence the Board was unable to consider on remand. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.302(a).

Entitlement to an initial rating higher than 30 percent for a left total knee arthroplasty is remanded.

This issue is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the decision on appeal. The Board must remand an appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A if the error occurred prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.802. VA's duty to assist claimants to obtain evidence needed to substantiate a claim includes making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant private medical records. 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.159(c)(1).  

In this case, the AOJ was on notice of the existence of outstanding and relevant private treatment records prior to issuing the decision on appeal but failed to undertake reasonable efforts to obtain those records. At an October 2018 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he received ongoing orthopedic care for his left knee at a private medical facility. Although there are some records from that facility in the claims file, there are no updated treatment records from 2013 onward related to the knees. Because the AOJ failed to undertake reasonable efforts to obtain those identified private records prior to issuing the decision on appeal, remand is necessary to correct that error.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for Mount Sinai Hospital so that the records associated with his ongoing orthopedic treatment for his left knee disability at that facility from 2013, onward, may be obtained.  If the form is received, make two requests for the records, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.  Any negative responses should be in writing and should be associated with the claims file.
