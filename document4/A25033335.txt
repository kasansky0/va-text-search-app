REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), to include as secondary to service-connected disabilities, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1998 to December 1998. 

This claim comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a  September 7, 2021, rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome. The appeal will therefore be considered pursuant to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). See Pub. L. No. 115-55, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). On November 1, 2021, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) and selected the Direct Review Docket. 

Under the AMA, the evidentiary record the Board may consider depends on the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in the decision on appeal and the Veteran's docket selection on the NOD. The present appeal stems from disagreement with the September 7, 2021, rating decision which considered the evidence of record at the time. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400; 3.2500; 3.2601. As indicated above, the Veteran selected the Direct Review Docket when submitting the NOD in November 2021. The Board may therefore only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 7, 2021, rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a). If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the September 7, 2021, rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ upon adjudication. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that on August 10, 2021, the Veteran submitted a NOD indicating disagreement with the July 19, 2021, rating decision, and electing review under the Direct Review Docket. That appeal was docketed on August 16, 2021. Because the Veteran submitted additional evidence along with the August 2021 NOD, the Board sent correspondence to the Veteran reminding him that because he selected the Direct Review option, any evidence submitted after the July 19, 2021, rating decision on appeal would not be considered, and clarifying whether he desired to change his docket option. See AMA Notification Letter, dated January 8, 2025; see also Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56, 61 (2023). As no such discrepancy occurred at the time of the November 2021 NOD, the Board will adjudicate the current appeal as appropriate. 

Entitlement To Service Connection for CFS

Under the AMA, the Board must remand to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors (including when the AOJ failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records, failed to obtain a VA examination, or provided an inadequate VA examination or opinion). 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Additionally, under the AMA, the Board may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim, not just pre-decisional duty to assist errors. Id.

The Veteran contends that his CFS is caused by or is the result of his service-connected chronic kidney disease with hypertension and hypertensive heart disease with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CKD), and/or the medications prescribed to treat his service-connected adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, hypertensive heart disease with non-obstructive coronary artery disease with myocardial bridging, and hypertension disabilities. See, Web/HTML Documents, received April 15, 2014; see also NOD, received November 1, 2021.

In this case, the AOJ has conceded that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of CFS and that the primary condition, CKD, is service connected. See Rating Decision - Narrative, dated September 7, 2021. The Board is bound by these findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Evidence also indicates that the Veteran is service connected for an adjustment disorder, hypertensive heart disease, and hypertension, all of which require prescription medication. See Rating Decision - Codesheet, dated September 7, 2021; see also CAPRI at 112, received July 2, 2020. The Board is therefore left to determine whether the service-connected CKD, and/or, the medications required to treat the Veteran's adjustment disorder, hypertensive heart disease, and hypertension disabilities caused or aggravated the CFS. 

The Veteran has attended VA examinations in association with his claim for benefits. See C&P Exam, received July 1, 2021, and CAPRI at 16, received February 19, 2014. The February 2014 examiner determined that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for CFS and that his subjective symptoms were due to "other" co-morbid conditions. See CAPRI at 18, received February 19, 2014. No medical opinion was requested, and none was provided. The July 2021 examiner similarly concluded that the Veteran has "clear and distinct reasons" for his fatigue, and that his condition "is not rheumatological chronic fatigue syndrome." See C&P Exam, received July 1, 2021. 

The Board finds the aforementioned medical opinions to be generally insufficient for rating purposes and new opinions must be obtained. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide an examination or obtain a medical opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate). Neither examiner was requested to provide secondary medical opinions concerning the medications required for the Veteran's adjustment disorder, hypertensive heart disease, and hypertension disabilities. Furthermore, although both examiners cited other distinct reasons as the cause of the Veteran's fatigue, neither elaborated on what those reasons were. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (indicating that most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning). Moreover, neither of the examiners included any discussion of the Veteran's specific medical history or his statements regarding his symptomatology. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 102 (2007) (an opinion is inadequate when the examiner does not consider a claimant's medical history); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report that which is gained through the senses). 

Finally, in the case of the July 2021 medical opinion, an opinion was provided without the benefit of updated VA Medical Center treatment records which the Veteran had identified in the July 28, 2021, VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application. In fact, prior to the July 2021 supplemental claim, the last time VA treatment records were uploaded to the Veteran's electronic folder was 2020, and even then, those records were from Orlando facilities, and not from the Salisbury or Fayetteville facilities, as was indicated by the Veteran. 

In sum, the Board finds that the AOJ committed pre-decisional duty to assist errors in not obtaining sufficiently rationalized medical opinions, and not obtaining the VAMC treatment records identified by the Veteran. Remand is therefore warranted. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain VA Medical Center treatment records from the Salisbury and Fayetteville locations as identified by the Veteran. See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, received July 18, 2021. 

2. Request an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician to identify the nature and etiology of the Veteran's CFS. ***If an opinion cannot be completed without a full examination, then one should be scheduled. The claims file is to be made available to the examiner and reviewed. The examiner is asked to opine:

Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the CFD: (i) was caused by; or (ii) was aggravated by the service-connected CKD and/or any of the medications prescribed to treat the service-connected adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, hypertensive heart disease with non-obstructive coronary artery disease with myocardial bridging, or hypertension? 

***Permanent worsening need NOT be shown, and ANY increase in disability is sufficient to demonstrate aggravation. 

***In forming these opinions, the examiner must consider the evidence provided by the Veteran indicating a link between CFS and the medications he is currently prescribed. See Web/HTML Documents, received June 2, 2014, and June 13, 2012. 

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to testify as to the nature and severity of his symptomatology, and the onset of his symptoms. If there is a medical reason to doubt the accuracy of the Veteran's statements this should be clearly expressed with a rationale as supported by the evidence.

A full rationale for any opinion offered should be provided. If an opinion cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner should provide an explanation as to why this is so and note what, if any, additional evidence would permit such an opinion to be made.
