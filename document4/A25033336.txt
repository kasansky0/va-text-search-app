REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1998 to January 2008, including service during the Gulf War Era.

The present appeal addresses effective dates for the awards of service connection of bilateral hearing loss, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and corresponding Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.  As each claim arose from unique procedural pathways, the histories of each are outlined below for ease of analysis.

In brief, the current appeal stems from a September 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, Higher Level Review Rating Decision denying a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss and earlier effective dates for PTSD and DEA.  In an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran appealed those denials and elected the Direct Review docket.  As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, direct review by the Board without submission of additional evidence and without a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record the time of the underlying June 2022 and February 2023 Rating Decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Earlier Effective Date

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date of October 25, 2021, the date of his intent to file a claim, for service connection of bilateral hearing loss, PTSD, and DEA.  See August 2024 NOD.  The Board notes, however, that the award of service connection of bilateral hearing loss is currently effective October 25, 2021.  Notwithstanding, the Board will address the Veteran's contentions.  The Board further notes that the Veteran has not expressed disagreement with the noncompensable rating for bilateral hearing loss.  Rather, he explicitly lists "Effective date of service connection for hearing loss" as the specific issue on appeal.  While the Board will not directly address the assigned noncompensable rating, the record does not suggest a modification is warranted.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (emphasis added).  An initial claim includes a new claim requesting service connection and a claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i), the effective date for a grant of direct service connection will be the day following separation from active service if a claim is received within one year after separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  When a complete claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the effective date rules may be applied based on the intent to file.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Relevant to the present appeal, continuous pursuit of a claim or an issue can be achieved by timely and properly filing an appropriate review option (Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review), generally within one year.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as a of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, as opposed to the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c).

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply.  Id. at 781-82.

Bilateral Hearing Loss

On September 3, 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ claim for service connection of bilateral hearing loss.  In a June 2021 Rating Decision, the claim was denied upon finding that the Veteran lacked a current diagnosis of hearing loss for VA purposes.  In August 2021, the Veteran attempted to file another VA Form 21-526EZ seeking service connection for bilateral hearing loss but was advised by VA to submit the request on a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim, which he did on April 27, 2022.  Prior to filing the April 2022 Supplemental Claim, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim on October 25, 2021.

In a June 2022 Rating Decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection of bilateral hearing loss and assigned a noncompensable evaluation, effective October 25, 2021, the date of his intent to file a claim.

Analysis

As outlined above, the Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection of bilateral hearing loss on September 3, 2020.  The claim was denied in a June 2021 Rating Decision, from which the Veteran then filed a supplemental claim less than one year later, on April 27, 2022.  It is from the April 2022 supplemental claim that the present appeal stems.

Upon review of the record, the Board explicitly finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued the claim for bilateral hearing loss since the initial claim was filed on September 3, 2020.  To establish an effective date earlier than October 25, 2021, for the grant of service connection of bilateral hearing loss, the Veteran must show (1) that he had a prior claim of service connection of bilateral hearing loss that remained pending, and, if so, (2) that his bilateral hearing loss first manifested prior to October 25, 2021.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The Board finds both criteria are established.

In the September 2023 HLR Rating Decision, the RO denied an effective earlier than October 25, 2021, upon concluding that the date of his intent to file a claim should be associated with his April 2022 supplemental claim.  Although the RO discussed continuous pursuit, no finding of continuous pursuit was effectuated.  As noted above, the Board finds the claim has been continuously pursued since September 3, 2020, and the October 2021 intent to file a claim is not relevant for the assignment of an effective date for hearing loss.  Moreover, the Board finds it unlikely that the Veteran specifically applied for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and then coincidentally developed bilateral hearing loss at a later date.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776; see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  As such, entitlement to an effective date of September 3, 2020, for the award of service connection of bilateral hearing loss is granted.

PTSD 

On April 3, 2017, the Veteran filed an initial VA Form 21-526EZ claim for service connection of PTSD.  In an August 2017 Rating Decision, the claim was denied upon finding that the Veteran lacked a current diagnosis of PTSD.  In August 2021, the Veteran attempted to file another VA Form 21-526EZ seeking service connection of PTSD but was advised by VA to submit the request on a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim, which he did on September 14, 2022.  Within one year prior to filing the September 2022 Supplemental Claim, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim on October 25, 2021.

In a February 2023 Rating Decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection of PTSD and assigned a 70 percent rating, effective September 14, 2022, the date of the supplemental claim.  In the September 2023 HLR decision, the RO denied an earlier effective date finding that once VA associates a specific application for benefits with an intent to file, the intent to file is no longer available for assigning an effective date of entitlement to the same benefit for which the claimant might subsequently apply.  In sum, the RO found the October 25, 2021, intent to file a claim was associated with the Veteran's claim for bilateral hearing loss and could not simultaneously be associated with the later supplemental claim for PTSD.

The Board, however, has herein found the Veteran's claim for bilateral hearing loss was continuously pursued and the October 25, 2021, intent to file is not associated with his claim for bilateral hearing loss.  In that regard, the intent to file is properly associated with the Veteran's claim for PTSD and an effective date of October 25, 2021, for PTSD is warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (When a complete claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the effective date rules may be applied based on the intent to file.).

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776; see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  As such, entitlement to an effective date of October 25, 2021, for the award of service connection of PTSD is granted.

DEA

In light of the foregoing assignment of an effective date of October 25, 2021, for the award of service connection of PTSD, the Board finds entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 is also warranted because a total disability is now assigned from October 25, 2021.

Finally, the Board has considered whether an inferred claim for a total disability based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) has been raised pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  The Veteran's representative submitted an appellate brief which contains boilerplate wholly inapplicable to the present appeal, including nonspecific verbiage suggesting entitlement to a TDIU.  The record reflects that the Veteran was denied a TDIU in an unappealed September 2019 Rating Decision.  The Board finds that VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran has been employed throughout the period on appeal.  See September 2024 Mental Health Notes.  The issue of a TDIU does not arise in the context of an earlier effective date claim when there is no allegation or evidence of unemployability.  See Jackson v. Shinseki, 587 F.3d 1106 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (no evidence indicating unemployability, i.e. veteran was employed, a TDIU claim was not raised.)  As such, a Rice claim is not raised.
