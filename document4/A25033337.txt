ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, symptoms of the Veteran's tinnitus began during, and have continued since, active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from July 1977 to December 1997.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

A review of the August 2024 VA Form 10182 reveals that the Veteran listed two June 2024 rating decisions that he wished to appeal with respect to his claim for service connection for tinnitus. 

The Board is required to read pleadings liberally and sympathetically in the direct appeal phase of proceedings before the Board. See Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2009). However,  "the Board is unable to act on a 'matter' absent an appealable, binding [regional office] decision that is adverse to the claimant." Sellers v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 265, 274 (2012); see also 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104(a).?? 

To that end, the Board notes that the AOJ rating decision issued on June 13, 2024 only deferred the issue of service connection for tinnitus for additional development. It is not considered a decision adverse to the Veteran. After additional development was completed, the claim was denied in an AOJ rating decision issued June 26, 2024. As such, the Board finds the rating decision issued on June 26, 2024, denying service connection for tinnitus is the only rating decision on appeal.

Therefore, the Board may consider the evidence of record up to the time of the June 28, 2024 notification letter issued to the Veteran with respect to the June 26, 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends he experiences tinnitus due to consistent in-service exposure to hazardous noise, including small-arms, large weapons systems, helicopters, and loud shipboard noises. See February 2024 claim. Specifically, he claims he experienced deafness after a grenade exploded in mid-air in front of him. See February 2024 VA examination. 

Service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) competent evidence of a causal relationship, or nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Additionally, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, such as organic diseases of the nervous system, are presumed to have been incurred in service if manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. Tinnitus is deemed an organic disease of the nervous system where there is evidence of acoustic trauma. Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015). Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), the VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 ; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

The June 2024 rating decision established that 1) the Veteran was diagnosed with recurrent tinnitus at a February 2024 VA contract medical examination; 2) the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise while in service; and 3) he had participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during active duty. Absent clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

Thus, the remaining inquiry is whether the Veteran's tinnitus had its onset in, or is otherwise related to, the Veteran's military service, to include his conceded noise exposure therein. To this end, the Board observes that, as a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report on matters observed or within his personal knowledge. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). Moreover, when a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, as is the case with tinnitus, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature," and is capable of lay observation. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 305 (2007). Therefore, the Veteran is competent to provide statements of the above symptoms, such as the onset of mild, intermittent ringing in his ears between 1992 and 1997 that worsened in severity and duration throughout his post-service years. See February 2024 VA examination. 

Turning to evidence in favor of the claim, the Veteran's reports of hazardous noise exposure throughout his Navy career are consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's service and supported by his military occupational specialties (MOS), including Independent Duty Afloat Storekeeper, SNAP II Supply and Financial Management Supervisor, and Supply & Accounting Technical Specialist which was conceded by the AOJ in the June 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (b); Reeves v. Shinseki, 682 F.3d 988, 988-99. In addition to the Veteran's MOS, military personnel records (MPRs) reveal the Veteran was deployed with explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) units several times throughout his 20 year military career. See March 2024 correspondence. Moreover, an August 2023 VA treatment record confirms that the Veteran endorsed "chronic tinnitus" that has "[become] more bothersome." See VA treatment records received February 22, 2024. 

The Board acknowledges that a February 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not associated with his active duty service, noting both the absence of complaints in his service treatment records (STRs), and no evidence of a significant shift in auditory thresholds while on active duty. See February 2024 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus DBQ. In addition, a June 2024 VA examiner determined it was less likely than not that the Veteran's tinnitus was due to his TERA participation while on active duty. See June 2024 VA examination. 

For a medical opinion to be adequate, it must be: (1) based upon sufficient facts or data; (2) be the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) be the result of principles and methods reliably applied to the facts. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008). The Board finds the rationale used by the February 2024 examiner in rendering his nexus opinion to be inadequate, and thus not entitled to probative weight, as the examiner failed to address the lay evidence of in-service incurrence and claimed chronicity since service.  Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007).  Moreover, the Board notes that the mere absence of evidence in the service treatment records does not equate to unfavorable evidence.  See Forshey v. Principi, 284 F.3d 1335, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (en banc) (cautioning that negative evidence, meaning actual evidence weighing against a party, must not be equated with the absence of substantive evidence).

Furthermore, the Board finds the June 2024 TERA opinion to be incomplete. Though the examiner considered the chemical and particulate matter TERAs to which the Veteran was found to have been exposed, the examiner did not consider the effect of toxic and hazardous noise conceded to have been experienced by the Veteran throughout his military career. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 300-301 (to be considered adequate, an examination should consider all relevant evidence of record).

Therefore, in light of the Veteran's competent and credible reports of onset of tinnitus symptoms in service and the chronic worsening of those symptoms since service, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that his currently diagnosed tinnitus had its onset during his active duty service. Consequently, service connection for tinnitus is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53.
