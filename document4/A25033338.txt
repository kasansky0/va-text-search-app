DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a higher initial rating than 40 percent for lumbosacral strain is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On August 22, 2022, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant's attorney that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant's authorized representative have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 19.55. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1997 to January 2005. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.55. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. In an August 22, 2022 written correspondence, the Veteran's attorney identified the case number for this appeal, and requested that it be withdrawn.  

Therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
