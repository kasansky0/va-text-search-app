REMANDED

The issue of entitlement to eligibility for benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Navy from December 1965 to September 1971. A.D. is the individual who submitted the underlying joint application with the Veteran and is interested in serving as Primary Family Caregiver (hereinafter Caregiver Applicant).  38?U.S.C. §?1720G(a)(12); 38?C.F.R. §?71.25. 

The decision on appeal was issued in January 2025 by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). This decision constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In January 2025, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review the January 2025 decision.  The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The issue of entitlement to eligibility for benefits under the PCAFC is remanded.

The Veteran and Caregiver Applicant, A.D., asserts that the January 2025 decision erred in finding the Veteran was not eligible for the PCAFC.  Specifically, the January 2025 decision found the Veteran did not require "hands-on assistance" with one or more Activities of Daily Living (ADL) each time they were completed; the caregiver provided more assistance with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), which are outside the scope of PCAFC eligibility; and the Veteran was capable of making independent decisions, as well as identifying and advocating for their own healthcare needs. See February 2025 PCAFC-Veteran at 79. 

The decision relied, in part, on an October 2021 Centralized Eligibility and Appeals Team (CEAT) assessment, which found the Veteran did not meet the PCAFC eligibility criteria, because he did not require care from a Family Caregiver for a minimum of six months due to an inability to perform an ADL or need supervision, protection, or instruction. See February 2025 PCAFC-Veteran at 1072.

Although the Board regrets the additional delay, the Board finds remand is warranted to satisfy a statutory duty under 38?U.S.C. §?5104 and to correct a pre-decisional error to assist the appellant in the development of this claim.? 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a)(the Board shall remand for correction of an AOJ error to satisfy its duties under 38?U.S.C. §?5103A and may remand for correction of any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim).? 

Improper Notice

First, the AOJ failed to provide the Veteran, Caregiver Applicant and the Veteran's representative proper notice in order to be able to substantiate their claim. Specifically, the January 2025 notification of the PCAFC decision does not meet the criteria outlined in 38?U.S.C. §?5104(b) and as directed in 38?U.S.C. §?1720G(a)(12).? 

Generally, notice under 38?U.S.C. §?5104 must include the following:?? 

1.	Identification of the issues adjudicated.?? 

2.	A summary of the evidence considered by the Secretary.?? 

3.	A summary of the applicable laws and regulations.?? 

4.	Identification of findings favorable to the claimant.?? 

5.	In the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial.?? 

6.	An explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision.?? 

7.	If applicable, identification of the criteria that must be satisfied to grant service connection or the next higher level of compensation.?? 

38?U.S.C. §?5104(b).? 

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.5, an appellant will be accorded full right to representation at all stages in an appeal.

The January 2025 decision explained that the Veteran did not meet PCAFC eligibility criteria because he was not in need of personal care services, but did not provide a summary of the evidence, the applicable laws and regulations, any favorable findings or other elements that were not satisfied leading to the denial, or an explanation of how to obtain or access the evidence used in making the decision.? Without adequate notice of the basis for the denial, claimants cannot make an informed decision as to whether or not to accept or appeal the decision nor can they know what evidence to submit in order to substantiate the appeal.? See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?232, 252 (2007) (discussing the legislative history of 38?U.S.C. §?5104 and the importance of clear and informative notice of decisions).? 

Moreover, the Veteran's representative was never notified nor received a copy or notice of the January 2025 decision. VA cannot inadvertently deny the Veteran the right to representation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.5. 

As such, the Board cannot meaningfully review the AOJ's determination.? On remand, the AOJ must provide complete notice of the decision as required by 38?U.S.C. §?5104 and 38?U.S.C. §?1720G(a)(12) to the Veteran, Caregiver Applicant and representative.? The Veteran's representative should be mailed a copy of the January 2025 decision.

Furthermore, the January 2025 decision that determined the Veteran was not entitled to eligibility for participation in VA's PCAFC relied on an October 2021 CEAT review, which found that the Veteran did not meet the PCAFC eligibility criteria, in part, because he did "not require care from a Family Caregiver for a minimum of six months due to... a need for supervision, protection, or instruction."  See 38?C.F.R. §?71.20(a)(3).  However, the Board finds that the CEAT review is legally inadequate to support the decision made because it is based on an invalidated legal definition.

 Under VA regulations in effect at the time of the October 2021 CEAT review, "[n]eed for supervision, protection, or instruction" meant an individual had a functional impairment that directly impacts the individual's ability to maintain his or her personal safety on a daily basis.  See 38?C.F.R. §?71.15. 

However, in Veteran Warriors, Inc. v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 29 F.4th 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2022), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) determined that VA's definition of "supervision, protection, or instruction" under 38?C.F.R. §?71.15 conflicts with the text of the statute it implements, 38?U.S.C. §?1720G(a)(2)(C)(ii)-(iii).  That statute establishes that, if a Veteran meets the other eligibility criteria, he or she is eligible for PCAFC benefits if in need of personal care services because of either "a need for supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury" (subsection (ii)) or "a need for regular or extensive instruction or supervision without which the ability of the veteran to function in daily life would be seriously impaired" (subsection (iii)).  The Federal Circuit found that by requiring "supervision...on a daily basis," VA created a single frequency requirement for "supervision" that was inconsistent with the statutory language.  Veteran Warriors, Inc., 29 F.4th at 1342.  It also concluded that the requirement of "a functional impairment that directly impacts the individual's ability to maintain his or her personal safety" was inconsistent with the statutory text, as subsection (iii) was "unambiguously broad enough to encompass impairments that do not implicate personal safety," and therefore "some aspects of the statutory language provide benefits to veterans who need supervision or instruction but would not risk their personal safety in the absence of that care."  Id. at 1342-43.  The Federal Circuit therefore invalidated VA's definition of "supervision, protection, or instruction" contained in 38?C.F.R. §?71.15. 

Thus, by denying PFAFC eligibility because the Veteran did not have a "need for supervision, protection, or instruction" under 38?C.F.R. §?71.20(a)(3), as the phrase was defined under 38?C.F.R. §?71.15, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim under invalid legal criteria, and the Veteran's claim has not yet been properly considered under the eligibility criteria set forth in 38?U.S.C. §?1720G(a)(2)(C)(ii)-(iii).  See VAOGCPREC 7-03 (rules announced in judicial decisions apply retroactively to all cases still open when the new rule is announced). As such, remand is warranted to consider the claim under the proper criteria.

Medical Opinion

After review of the record, the Board finds that the October 2021 CEAT review is legally inadequate to support the January 2025 denial of benefits. 

As a general matter, a decision by VA affecting the furnishing of assistance or support under the Caregiver Program shall be considered a medical determination.  38?U.S.C. §?1720G.? The issue turns on the medical judgment of VHA and CEAT in determining whether the Veteran met the basic medical eligibility criteria under PCAFC.? See 85 Fed. Reg. 46226, 46230 (July 31, 2020).

That said, decisions as to eligibility under a Caregiver Program have been held to be subject to Board review.? See Beaudette v. McDonough, 34?Vet. App.?95, 105 (2021).? It is within the Board's jurisdictional authority to review the adequacy of all medical opinions upon which eligibility decisions are made.? See Owens v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?429, 433 (1995); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2?Vet. App.?614 (1992).? This includes CEAT's medical determination on which the instant eligibility decision was based.? 

A VA opinion is adequate if it "sufficiently inform[s] the Board of the medical expert's judgment on a medical question and the essential rationale for that opinion."? See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26?Vet. App.?97, 105 (2012).? 

A non-exhaustive list of factors that, depending on the case, may be relevant considerations in determining the adequacy and probative value of a medical opinion include: (1) whether there was personal examination of the patient; (2) the expert's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data; (3) whether the opinion contains clear conclusions with supporting data and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two; (4) whether the opinion is clear and susceptible of only one meaning; (5) the expert's familiarity with pertinent medical history; (6) whether there is any inconsistency in the expert's statements; (7) whether the expert has provided a thorough and detailed opinion about an area within his or her expertise; (8) whether the expert has provided factually accurate, fully articulated, and sound reasoning for his or her conclusion; (9) whether the expert relied on sufficient facts or data; (10) whether the opinion is the product of reliable principles and methods; (11) whether the opinion is the result of principles and methods reliably applied to facts; and (12) whether medical text evidence that a medical opinion relies on contains qualifying or contradictory aspects where the text is entered into the record, at least in part. See McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243, 257 (2019).

An unexplained conclusory opinion is entitled to no weight in a service-connection context. Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 240 (2012).

In short, a medical opinion will be considered probative if it includes clear conclusions and supporting data with a reasoned analysis connecting the data and conclusions. A medical opinion that is a factually accurate, fully articulated, and based on sound reasoning carries significant weight. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

Here, the October 2021 CEAT review, that the January 2025 decision relied upon, does not meet these requirements as they are conclusory and unexplained. The October 2021 CEAT review found the Veteran did not require a minimum of 6 continuous months based on an inability to perform an ADL and/or a need for supervision, protection or instruction. The CEAT provided no reasoning, rationale, or justification for this decision. It did not cite to any medical findings or records underpinning the decision.  Simply put, the Board has no way to know how or why, to include on what medical basis, the CEAT reached this decision.

This is significant because there appears to be some favorable evidence contradicting this decision. 

In relevant part, there is an indication that the Veteran may have an inability to perform an ADL, each time he completes it. Namely, the parties assert they are entitled to benefits under PCFAC due to the severe effects of the Veteran's lower extremity and thoracolumbar spine disabilities, as he does not have the endurance or ability to perform ADLs. They assert the Veteran's disabilities requires the Caregiver Applicant to assist the Veteran with bathing, dressing, meal preparation, laundry, housekeeping, helping him out of bed, changing his bedding and garments nearly daily due to his urinary incontinence, replacing knee and back braces each time and generally with transfers to the upright walker to ensure his safety daily. A.D. reports that she has been providing these services for several years, his care needs are increasing, and without her assistance, the Veteran would need home care.  See January 2025 VA Form 10182; February 2025 PCAFC-Veteran at 22, 25, 44; and February 2025 PCAFC-Caregiver at 9-12.

The Board observes that the Veteran and the Caregiver Applicant are competent to report his ability or inability to perform ADLs, unless the record contains evidence undermining the credibility of the Veteran's statements. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). When considering evidence and determining its probative value, VA considers both the competency and the credibility of the witness. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994)(providing that "competency" is a "legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier or fact" and that "credibility" is a "factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted"). 

Additionally, throughout the appellate period, the Veteran was afforded Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living assessments in September 2022 and September 2024, where he was determined to score a 4 out of 8 and 0 out of 8, indicative of medium functioning in September 2022 and low functioning, dependent by September 2024 (8= highly independent and 0 = low function, dependent). See February 2025 PCAFC- Veteran at 461, 962.

To that end, the Board cannot assess how the CEAT reconciled its decision with the potentially favorable evidence of record.  The decision is conclusory and unexplained.  In fact, it is a compound finding. As mentioned above, the assessment was based on invalided criteria. The Board is not able to determine whether the CEAT decided that he (a) did not require personal care services, (b) for a minimum of 6 continuous months, (c) based on an inability to perform an ADL each time he completes one, and/or had (d) a need for supervision, protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury; or (e) a need for regular or extensive instruction or supervision without which the ability of the Veteran to function in daily life would be seriously impaired. The decision did not break down which of these requirements was not met. 

In sum, the October 2021 CEAT review that the January 2025 decision relied upon to deny the claim, failed to cite to any evidence specific to the Veteran to support their finding, including the Veteran's and Caregiver Applicant's contentions.  Also, as mentioned above, this determination was in any case based on legally invalid criteria. Accordingly, a remand is required for a new medical opinion that adequately addresses the criteria for eligibility for PCAFC benefits set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 1720G(a)(2)(C). This action is needed to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Mail a copy of the January 2025 PCAFC decision, second level clinical appeal decision, to the Veteran's representative.

2. Obtain a medical opinion from CEAT as to whether the Veteran is in need personal care services because of: 

(a.) An inability to perform an activity of daily living, each time he completes one or more of the following:

i.	Dressing or undressing oneself; 

ii.	Bathing; 

iii.	Grooming oneself in order to keep oneself clean and presentable; 

iv.	Adjusting any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, that by reason of the particular disability, cannot be done without assistance (this does not include the adjustment of appliances that nondisabled persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); 

v.	Toileting or attending to toileting; 

vi.	Feeding oneself due to loss of coordination of upper extremities, extreme weakness, inability to swallow, or the need for a non-oral means of nutrition; or 

vii.	Mobility (walking, going up stairs, transferring from bed to chair, etc.); or

(b.) A need for supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury; or 

(c.) A need for regular or extensive instruction or supervision without which the ability of the Veteran to function in daily life would be seriously impaired.

In answering all questions, the medical facts and reasons underpinning every conclusion must be articulated.  CEAT must (1) identify what facts and information support the conclusion, and (2)?explain how that evidence justifies each conclusion. 

Specifically, CEAT must consider:

(a.) Lay statements from the Veteran and Caregiver Applicant where they contend the Veteran does not have the endurance or ability to perform ADLs; they assert Caregiver Applicant must assist the Veteran with bathing, dressing, meal preparation, laundry, housekeeping, helping him out of bed, changing his bedding and garments nearly daily due to his urinary incontinence, replacing knee and back braces each time and generally with transfers to the upright walker to ensure his safety daily. The Caregiver applicant reports that she has been providing these services for several years, his care needs are increasing, and without her assistance, the Veteran would need home care.  See January 2025 VA Form 10182; February 2025 PCAFC-Veteran at 22, 25, 44; and February 2025 PCAFC-Caregiver at 9-12; and

(b.) Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living assessments conducted in September 2022 and September 2024, where the Veteran scored a 4 out of 8 and 0 out of 8, indicative of medium functioning in September 2022 and low functioning, dependent by September 2024 (8 = highly independent and 0 = low function, dependent). See February 2025 PCAFC- Veteran at 461, 962.

3. Readjudicate the claim for entitlement to eligibility for benefits under PCAFC pursuant to the appropriate eligibility criteria, including those set forth in 38?U.S.C. §?1720G(a)(2)(C)(ii)-(iii), in accordance with the Federal Circuit's opinion in Veteran Warriors, Inc. v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 29 F.4th 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2022). 

4. Upon completion of directives #1-3, issue the Veteran, the Caregiver Applicant, A.D., and the Veteran's representative notice of the decision as described in 38?U.S.C. §?5104.  The notice shall include, but is not limited to, a summary of the evidence; a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; identification of findings favorable to the claimant; and identification of the elements not satisfied but necessary for establishing eligibility for PCAFC benefits under 38?U.S.C. §?1720G and 38?C.F.R. §§ 71.15-71.25.
