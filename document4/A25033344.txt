DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder, anxious distress and alcohol use disorder (PTSD disability) is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for herpes simplex, type II, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence persuasively shows that the Veteran's PTSD disability arises from his period of honorable active-duty service. 

2. The evidence persuasively shows that the Veteran's herpes simplex, type II, arises from his period of honorable active-duty service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for service connection for herpes simplex, type II, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran honorably served in the United States Marine Corps from October 22, 2012 to January 2, 2019. The Veteran's service from January 3, 2019, to April 30, 2020, is dishonorable for VA purposes. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2020 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In his December 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held by the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in December 2024. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2020 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims granted herein, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record in conjunction with this case. However, it has limited its discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008). Thus, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims on appeal.

1. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD disability is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for herpes simplex, type II, is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for PTSD and herpes simplex, type II, and contends that it arises from his active-duty service. See December 2024 Hearing Transcript. 

The Board turns first to address the Veteran's periods of service which was the initial bar to the claims on appeal. Status as a veteran is a perquisite to a claim for VA benefits. Cropper v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 450, 452 (1994); see also Gardner v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 415, 418-19 (2009). A veteran, for purposes of VA benefits, is defined as a "person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable." 38 U.S.C. § 102(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(d).

At the time of the November 2020 rating decision, the Veteran's service from October 22, 2012, to October 21, 2016, was honorable for VA purposes, however, his period of service from October 22, 2016, to April 30, 2020, was not. While the Board may not consider evidence outside of the AMA evidentiary window, an administrative document created by VA is not evidence and thus may be considered in the adjudication of the Veteran's claim. To this end, a careful review of the Veteran's claims file shows that after the rating decision on appeal, the VA found that his period of service in the United States Marine Corps from October 22, 2012, to January 2, 2019, was honorable for VA purposes. See February 2022 Codesheet. 

Thus, the question now before the Board is whether it may grant service connection based upon the Veteran's period of honorable service from October 22, 2012, to January 2, 2019. Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

However, there are particular requirements for establishing service connection for PTSD in 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) that are separate from those for establishing service connection generally. See Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (i.e., a diagnosis of PTSD pursuant to the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-V)); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).

Moving to the first element of service connection, the Board takes judicial notice that in a December 2020 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran had current diagnoses of herpes simplex, type II, and PTSD with major depressive disorder, anxious distress and alcohol use disorder. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c) (absent clear and unmistakable error, favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on the Board). The Board notes that the Veteran's psychiatric diagnoses were made pursuant to the DSM-V. See September 2020 Initial PTSD Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).

Turning to the second element of service connection, the AOJ favorably found in the December 2020 rating decision that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) showed that his herpes simplex, type II, had its onset on or about June 2018, during his period of honorable VA service. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). A review of the Veteran's STRs during his period of active-duty service shows that he reported symptoms of and was found to have herpes simplex, type II, in June 2018, September 2018, and July 2019. See July 2020 STR. Similarly, the December 2020 rating decision found that the Veteran had an in-service PTSD stressor as result of his deployment to Iraq in 2017. Id. This in-service PTSD stressor is during the Veteran's period of honorable VA service. 

Turning to the third element of service connection, a September 2020 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD disability was causally related to his deployment to Iraq. See September 2020 Medical Opinion Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). Similarly, in another September 2020 medical opinion, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's herpes simplex, type II, was causally related to his active-duty service. In support of their conclusion, the September 2020 VA examiner pointed to the Veteran's STRs which showed in-service reports of herpes simplex, type II, in June 2018 and July 2019, during the Veteran's period of honorable active duty service. 

Here, the evidence of record persuasively shows that service connection is warranted for both claims. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (reasonable doubt to be resolved in Veteran's favor); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is in approximate balance). As there is no doubt herein to resolve, the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for PTSD and herpes simplex, type II, are granted.
