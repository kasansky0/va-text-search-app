FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the promulgation of a decision in this appeal, the Veteran and his attorney requested a withdrawal of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, low back problems, bilateral hearing loss, gout, and plantar fasciitis.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, low back problems, bilateral hearing loss, gout, and plantar fasciitis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2001 to January 2007.  This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February 2021, May 14, 2021, and May 20, 2021 rating decisions from a Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, low back problems, bilateral hearing loss, gout, and plantar fasciitis, is dismissed.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 U.S.C. § 20.205.

In March 2025, the Veteran and his attorney submitted written correspondence, received by the VA on March 4, 2025 and March 17, 2025, stating that the Veteran wished to withdraw his appeal as to entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, low back problems, bilateral hearing loss, gout, and plantar fasciitis.  Id.

The Board finds that the language used in the March 2025 correspondence is clear and unambiguous and its return to the Board is indicative of an informed and purposeful decision. See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011). As such, the Board finds that the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.
