ORDER

The matter of an overpayment of VA disability compensation benefits due to the Veteran being on fugitive felon status is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the adjudication of the matter on appeal, the Veteran withdrew his appeal in writing in October 2024.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of an overpayment of VA disability compensation benefits due to the Veteran being on fugitive felon status have been met.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 2004 to June 2009.

This matter is on appeal from a February 2024 notification letter by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.

However, in October 2024, the Veteran withdrew his appeal, thereby negating the need for a hearing.

The veteran or the veteran's representative may withdraw an appeal as to any or all issues on appeal.  Except for appeals withdrawn on the record at a hearing, withdrawal must be in writing.  A withdrawal is effective when received provided that receipt is prior to the issuance of a decision by the Board.  Withdrawal of a claim constitutes a withdrawal of the notice of disagreement and, if filed, the substantive appeal.

In October 2024, the Veteran withdrew his appeal in writing.  Therefore, the appeal will be dismissed.
