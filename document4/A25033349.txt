ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's intervertebral disc syndrome and spinal stenosis (back disability) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's back disability began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for the Veteran's back disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from November 2014 to June 2015, with additional reserve service in the National Guard.

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the July 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal.  In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  To establish service connection for the claimed disorder, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry.  First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source.  Second, the Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007).  Third, the Board must weigh the probative value of the evidence in light of the entirety of the record.  A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his back disability in May 2023.  He reported that he began experiencing symptoms in 2015 that worsened over time.  His symptoms initial manifested in back pain, stiffness, and difficulty walking.   He attributed his conditions to the wear and tear of the military.  

The May 2023 VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's current back disability was related to his active duty service.  The examiner noted that the Veteran indicated that his symptoms began in service, but he did not report the symptoms and instead managed them with medication.  Over time, his symptoms worsened, and he was diagnosed and treated with a back disability beginning in 2019.  The examiner noted that symptoms of spinal stenosis may develop gradually and usually worsen over time.  Thus, the Veteran's disability was caused by his military service. 

In a November 2023 VA opinion, an examiner opined that the Veteran's back disability was not related to service.  The examiner noted the years between the Veteran's discharge from service and treatment for a back condition.  The medical records documented his initial treatment in 2019, and he was discharged from active duty service in 2015.  Additionally, the Veteran's service treatment records failed to indicate treatment or diagnosis for a back condition.  Thus, the examiner found that there was no connection to service.

The Board considers the positive and negative evidence of record in determining whether service connection is warranted.  The Board finds that the May 2023 VA examiner provided a credible, competent nexus opinion.  The examiner considered the Veteran's lay statements of in service back pain and noted that his condition could have a gradual onset and worsen over time.  The Board assigns the May 2023 VA opinion high probative weight.  Conversely, the negative November 2023 VA opinion was based on the lack of in service treatment for back pain and the length of time between separation from service and treatment.  The November 2023 VA opinion failed to consider the Veteran's lay statements that he experienced back pain in service but did not seek treatment because he self-medicated.  Likewise, the examiner did not address the May 2023 opinion that indicated spinal stenosis could have a gradual onset and worsen, which would explain the delay in treatment from separation.  Accordingly, the Board assigns lower probative value to the negative November 2023 VA opinion.

As the balance of probative evidence is in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for his back disability is warranted.
