REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant is a veteran (the Veteran) who had active-duty service from August 1976 to August 1996. 

This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2022 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

As the Veteran elected the Direct Review Lane in his Notice of Disagreement, there is one pertinent evidentiary window in this case. The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 11, 2022 agency of original jurisdiction decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the April 2022 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

DISABILITY RATINGS-LAW AND REGULATIONS

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

A disability rating may require re-evaluation in accordance with changes in condition. Thus, it is essential that the disability be considered in the context of the entire recorded history when determining the level of current impairment. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. See also Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Nevertheless, where a veteran is appealing the rating for an already established service-connected condition, his present level of disability is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, when an appeal is based on the assignment of an initial rating for a disability, following an initial award of service connection for this disability, the rule articulated in Francisco does not apply. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). The rating must be based on the overall recorded history of a disability, giving equal weight to past and present medical reports. Id. Staged ratings are appropriate for an increased-rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Generally, lay evidence is competent with regard to identification of a disease with unique and readily identifiable features which are capable of lay observation. A lay person may speak to etiology in some limited circumstances in which nexus is obvious merely through observation, such as sustaining a fall leading to a broken leg. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir 2007). 

Lay persons may also provide competent evidence regarding a contemporaneous medical diagnosis or a description of symptoms in service which supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. However, a lay person is not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions, i.e., those which are not capable of lay observation. Lay statements are not competent evidence regarding diagnosis or etiology in such cases. See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007) (concerning rheumatic fever); Jandreau, at 1377, n. 4 ('sometimes the layperson will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer'); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2).

After the evidence has been assembled, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. 

A VA claimant need only demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence in order to prevail. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). To deny a claim on its merits, the evidence must weigh against the claim. Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996), Gilbert at 54.

Entitlement to a disability rating higher than 10 percent for the service-connected vertigo.  

The current appeal arises from a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (compensation) received at VA on December 3, 2021, with intent to file received on November 9, 2021. In a March 14, 2022, rating decision, VA granted service connection for vertigo; assigned an initial disability rating of 0 percent under Diagnostic Code 6204; and assigned an effective date for the grant of service connection of November 9, 2021. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application on March 17, 2022. The claim for increase was denied in an April 11, 2022, rating decision (mailed on April 13, 2022). The Veteran submitted a Request for Higher-Level Review on March 20, 2023, identifying the date of decision as April 13, 2022. In a June 23, 2023, decision (mailed on June 29, 2023), VA increased the rating for vertigo to 10 Percent, effective November 9, 2021. On June 25, 2024, VA received the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement. 

Under Diagnostic Code 6204, peripheral vestibular disorders are assigned a rating of 30 percent with dizziness and occasional staggering. A rating of 10 percent is assigned with occasional dizziness.  

Note: Objective findings supporting the diagnosis of vestibular disequilibrium are required before a compensable evaluation can be assigned under this code. Hearing impairment or suppuration shall be separately rated and combined. See 38 CFR 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6204. 

A VA examination report dated January 6, 2022, includes a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Current symptoms included frequent dizziness, occasional blurred vision, room spinning in the morning when rising, and when going to bed, dizziness during the day. The Veteran reported increased symptoms when turning to the right side. Current treatment is none. The Veteran practices precautionary measures. Symptoms did not include hearing impairment with vertigo; hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait; tinnitus; vertigo; staggering; or hearing impairment and/or tinnitus. On examination, the Veteran's gait was normal. Romberg test was normal or negative. However, in contradiction to the negative report above, vertigo was noted on examination. Limb coordination test was normal. There was no impact of the condition on the Veteran's ability to work. 

VA outpatient records reveal recent complaints of dizziness, described as "mild" in October 2019. However, prior reports on April 27, 2016, May 8, 2017, November 6, 2017, May 7, 2018, and October 31, 2018, note that dizziness was denied. 

After a review of all of the evidence, the Board finds that the criteria for a disability rating higher than 10 percent are not met. 

While dizziness is contemplated by the current 10 percent rating, the 30 percent rating also requires staggering. As the conjunctive "and" is used, both criteria must be present to support a rating of 30 percent. See Melson v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 334 (1991) (use of the conjunctive "and" in a statutory provision meant that all of the conditions listed in the provision must be met).

Here, there is no description of symptomatology consistent with occasional staggering. An October 11, 2019, outpatient report notes that, other than feeling dizzy or lightheaded upon standing, the Veteran denied any new complaints. This is consistent with the normal gait reported by the January 2022 VA examiner, and the normal/negative Romberg test, which is a test for balance issues. See https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22901-romberg-test.

The Veteran has not provided any lay description that would substantiate this necessary element for a higher rating. Accordingly, the Board finds that occasional staggering is not associated with the Veteran's vertigo. 

In light of the above findings of fact, the Board concludes that a disability rating higher than 10 percent for the service-connected vertigo is not warranted. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence weighs against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 371 (2017) (the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

EFFECTIVE DATES-LAW AND REGULATIONS

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 

The effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran is the day following separation from active service or date entitlement arose if claim is received within 1 year after separation from service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Separation from service means separation under conditions other than dishonorable from continuous active service which extended from the date the disability was incurred or aggravated. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Prior to February 19, 2019, where "new and material" evidence was received prior to the expiration of the appeal period, or prior to the appellate decision if a timely appeal had been filed, it would be considered as having been received in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). 

This tolls the finality of the prior denial. New evidence is defined as evidence not previously submitted to agency decision makers and material evidence is evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last final denial of the claim sought to be reopened; and it must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).

Since February 19, 2019, except as otherwise provided, a claimant or his or her authorized representative, if any, who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim (see § 3.1(p)(2)) by submitting in writing or electronically a complete application (see § 3.160(a)) on a form prescribed by the Secretary any time after the agency of original jurisdiction issues notice of a decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending (§ 3.160(c)) or is finally adjudicated (§ 3.160(d)). 

If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the agency of original jurisdiction will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record. If new and relevant evidence is not presented or secured, the agency of original jurisdiction will issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim. In determining whether new and relevant evidence is presented or secured, VA will consider any VA treatment records reasonably identified by the claimant and any evidence received by VA after VA issued notice of a decision on the claim and while the evidentiary record was closed (see 3.103(c)). 

New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim. Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed. New and relevant evidence received before VA issues its decision on a supplemental claim will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim.

Since February 19, 2019, VA law recognizes continuously pursued claims. Except as otherwise provided, the effective date for a continuously pursued claim will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options within one year of the issuance of the decision. 

For supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues notice of a decision or the Board of Veterans' Appeals issued notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 9, 2021, for the establishment of service connection vertigo. 

In September 1996, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526 Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension. He listed hair loss, dizziness, chest pain, knee pain, compartment syndrome, wrist pain, and motion sickness. The claims were addressed in a March 1997 rating decision. Service connection was granted for a bilateral knee disorder. The remaining claims were denied. The Veteran did not respond within one year of that decision with a Notice of Disagreement or evidence submission. 

In November 2005, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim noting severe arthritis in both wrists and ankles, as well as the knees, sleep apnea, allergies, compartment syndrome, and social withdrawal. The claims were addressed in an August 2006 rating decision. Separate ratings were assigned for the right and left knee. The remaining claims were denied. While additional medical evidence was received regarding compartment syndrome in July 2006, the Veteran did not file a Notice of Disagreement within one year of the August 2006 decision or submit or identify additional evidence relating to vertigo, erectile dysfunction, or tinnitus within that period. 

The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim in October 2007 noting compartment syndrome, sleep apnea, bilateral wrists and ankles, and a heart condition, as well as hearing loss and tinnitus. He submitted medical records to support those claims in December 2007. In an August 2008 rating decision, VA denied reopening of the previously denied claims, and denied service connection for a heart condition, hearing loss, and tinnitus. The Veteran did not file a Notice of Disagreement within one year of the August 2008 decision. Although he submitted additional evidence regarding sleep apnea, his back, his heart and lungs, and compartment syndrome, he did not submit or identify additional evidence regarding vertigo, erectile dysfunction, or tinnitus within one year of the August 2008 decision. 

The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim in July 2010 noting compartment syndrome and lower back problems. He filed a VA Form 21-526b, Veteran Supplemental Claim, in March 2011 noting arthritis and a heart problem. In May 2011 and November 2011, he filed a VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim noting a heart problem as secondary to sleep apnea. In a March 2012 rating decision, VA denied increased ratings for the knees, but did not address the other claims. 

The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement in July 2012 claiming that service connection for a back disorder should be granted and that hip, leg, and heart problems are secondary to that. He filed a VA Form 21-526b, Veteran's Supplemental Claim along with that noting pseudofolliculitis barbae, and arthritis of the shoulders, hips, ankles, and neck. A February 2013 rating decision granted service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae and bilateral ankle disorders and denied service connection for neck, hip, and shoulder disorders. The Veteran perfected his appeal in August 2016. A Board hearing and written argument in April 2019 addressed his claims. However, in no submission or testimony pertinent to that separate appeal did he raise the matters of vertigo, tinnitus, or erectile dysfunction. 

The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application in December 2020 noting congestive heart failure, right hip disability, right leg pain, right leg numbness, and left leg numbness. He did not mention vertigo, tinnitus, or erectile dysfunction. The claims were denied in a January 2021 rating decision. 

As noted above, an intent to file was received on November 9, 2021. The Veteran filed three claims subsequent to the intent to file. The first, received on November 9, 2021, listed right leg and hip pain, bilateral leg numbness, and a heart condition. Two claims received on December 3, 2021, included claims for tinnitus, vertigo, and erectile dysfunction. This constitutes the first claim for erectile dysfunction, and the earliest pending claim for vertigo and tinnitus. 

After a review of all of the evidence, the Board finds that the criteria for an effective date earlier than November 9, 2021, for the grant of service connection for vertigo/dizziness, tinnitus, and/or erectile dysfunction are not met. 

There was no pending claim or intent to file for any of these disorders prior to November 9, 2021. While a claim for vertigo (dizziness) had been previously raised, it was subject to a final unappealed rating decision in March 1997. While a claim for tinnitus had been previously raised, it was subject to a final unappealed rating decision in August 2008. 

The Board acknowledges that the prior claims for vertigo and tinnitus constitute probative evidence that the Veteran had these disorders or that he had symptoms of these disorders prior to November 9, 2021. However, the presence of a particular disorder is only one factor to be considered in establishing an effective date for service connection for such disorder. 

Effective dates for service connection are fundamentally based on receipt of a claim. Moreover, as between the date of receipt of the claim and the date entitlement arose, it is the later of these dates that is used to establish the effective date. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

The Veteran had never filed a claim for erectile dysfunction prior to November 9, 2021. The unappealed denials of the claims for tinnitus and dizziness prior to November 9, 2021, means that those claims were no longer pending, but were final. The then-applicable provision for receipt of new and material evidence within one year of a denial allowed for the tolling of finality in the event of receipt of such evidence. However, in both cases, there was no receipt of new and material evidence within one year of either denial that would toll finality. The Veteran has not identified any such evidence, and the Board does not find such evidence. Thus, there is no pending claim earlier than November 9, 2021. 

The former provision 38 C.F.R. § 3.157 (in effect prior to March 24, 2015), does not apply in this case as it applies only to receipt of reports of examination or treatment for claims in which service connection has previously been established. 

In light of the above findings of fact, the Board concludes that an effective date for the grant of service connection prior to November 9, 2021, is not warranted regarding tinnitus, vertigo, or erectile dysfunction. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence weighs against each claim, that doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
