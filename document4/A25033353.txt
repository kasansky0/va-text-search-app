ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable initial rating for chronic rhinitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The weight of the competent evidence of record was not at least in approximate balance or nearly equal that the Veteran had a diagnosis of sinusitis during or proximate to the period on appeal.

2. The weight of the competent evidence of record was not at least in approximate balance or nearly equal that the Veteran had nasal polyps, greater than 50-percent obstruction of both nasal passages, or complete obstruction of at least one nasal passage during the period on appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1141, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303 (2024).

2. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable initial rating for chronic rhinitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6522 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1991 to September 1995, and from July 1997 to October 2012.  This matter came before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claims of entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis and entitlement to an increased rating for chronic rhinitis, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the requirement that the Board delay issuing a decision until the period to request to switch dockets elapses pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

1. Entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for chronic sinusitis.  The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of sinusitis and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Service connection is therefore not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Board's review indicates that service and VA treatment records are silent for complaints, diagnosis or treatment of sinusitis during or after service.  A March 2024 VA Sinusitis/Rhinitis Examination found that the Veteran did not have any diagnostic abnormalities on testing or imaging to confirm a sinusitis diagnosis.  The examiner instead diagnosed the Veteran with allergic rhinitis and documented the related symptoms.  The Board finds that the VA examination is adequate for appellate review.  There is no evidence that the examiner was not competent or credible, and as the report is based on the Veteran's statements, in-person examination, and the examiner's observations, the Board finds it is entitled to significant probative weight.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-05 (2008).

The record is negative for any evidence, other than the Veteran's own generalized assertion that he is entitled to service connection.  The Veteran did not present any lay or medical evidence of symptoms or diagnosis of sinusitis.  While he contends that he has chronic sinusitis that is related to service, as a layperson, he does not possess the medical expertise required to provide a nexus opinion.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  The Veteran is competent to report lay-observable symptoms.  Id.  However, the March 2024 VA examiner noted that the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis was rendered in lieu of a sinusitis diagnosis, and there is no indication that the reported symptoms were not considered and encompassed by the alternative diagnosis.

The Board therefore finds that the competent medical evidence of record is not at least in approximate balance or nearly equal that the Veteran was diagnosed with sinusitis during or proximate to the period on appeal.  As with all claims for service-connection, in the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Service connection was therefore not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

2. Entitlement to a compensable initial rating for chronic rhinitis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a higher initial rating for his chronic rhinitis, which is currently assigned a noncompensable evaluation.  For the reasons outlined below, the Board finds that a compensable initial rating is not warranted.

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's allergic rhinitis has been rated under DC 6522, which rates allergic or vasomotor rhinitis.  The highest rating under this DC is a 30 percent rating and it is assigned when there is rhinitis with polyps.  A 10 percent rating, the only other rating under this DC, is assigned for rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.

Treatment records are silent for any treatment, diagnosis, or complaints related to allergic rhinitis or similar disabilities.  The Veteran was afforded a VA Sinusitis/Rhinitis Examination in March 2024.  The Veteran reported sinus pressure and random coughing.  The examiner found that the Veteran had permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, but no polyps or obstruction greater than 50-percent of either nasal passage on objective imaging.  The Board finds that the VA examination is adequate for appellate review.  There is no evidence that the examiner was not competent or credible, and as the report is based on the Veteran's statements, in-person examination, and the examiner's observations, the Board finds it is entitled to significant probative weight.  Nieves-Rodriguez, supra.

The Board notes that the Veteran's representative submitted an Informal Hearing Presentation in July 2024 which contained additional evidence regarding the nature and severity of the Veteran's symptoms.  However, as noted above, the Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal.  Therefore, while the Bord will consider any argument presented by the Veteran's representative, it will provide this evidence no probative weight herein.

Upon review of the above, the Board finds that a compensable initial rating for allergic rhinitis was not warranted.  As noted above, a compensable 10 percent rating is not warranted under DC 6522 unless there is evidence of greater than 50-perecent obstruction of both nasal passages, or complete obstruction of at least one nasal passage.  The March 2024 VA examination specifically noted that no such obstruction was seen on examination or imaging.  The examiner also found that there was no evidence of polyps so as to warrant a 30 percent rating under DC 6522.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's competent lay statements regarding his symptoms of sinus pressure and coughing.  The evidence, however, did not contain findings or symptomatology that met the criteria for a higher rating under DC 6522 and it cannot be rated under another DC.  See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015) (holding that a condition specifically listed in the rating schedule may not be rated by analogy under another DC).  As the weight of the competent evidence is not at least in approximate balance or nearly equal that the Veteran met the higher applicable rating criteria, a compensable initial rating for his allergic rhinitis was not warranted.    38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522.
