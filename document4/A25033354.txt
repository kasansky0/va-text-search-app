ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder impingement syndrome is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the duration of the appeal, the probative evidence of record reflects that the Veteran's right shoulder impingement syndrome has been productive of, at worst, limitation of flexion to 90 degrees, abduction to 70 degrees, pain, and no additional limitation of motion; there are no findings of ankylosis.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for right shoulder impingement syndrome have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5201 (2020, 2021).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1990 to June 1991, with additional service in the National Guard.

A rating decision was issued under the legacy system in June 2018 and the Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement. In November 2019, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a statement of the case (SOC). In January 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and opted into the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), from the November 2019 SOC. In May 2020, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the November 2019 SOC.  

In the July 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2019 SOC, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or the Veteran's representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the November 2019 and prior to receipt of the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

In a February 2024 decision, the Board denied entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder impingement syndrome. The Veteran appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In a November 2024 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (Joint Motion), the Court partially vacated the February 2024 decision and remanded the appeal for further development in compliance with the remand directives specified in the Joint Motion. 

Right shoulder impingement syndrome

The Veteran contends that his service-connected right shoulder impingement syndrome warrants a higher rating. 

VA has adopted a Schedule for Rating Disabilities to evaluate service-connected disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part IV. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. The percentage ratings in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities represent, as far as practicably can be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from service-connected diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. Id. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. The schedule recognizes that disability from distinct injuries or diseases may overlap. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. However, the evaluation of the same disability or its manifestation under various diagnoses, which is known as pyramiding, is to be avoided. Id. 

Because the level of disability may have varied over the course of the claim, the rating may be "staged" higher or lower for segments of time during the period under review in accordance with such variations, to the extent the evidence shows distinct time periods where the service-connected disability has exhibited signs or symptoms that would warrant different ratings under the rating criteria. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In initial-rating cases, where the appeal stems from a granted claim of service connection with respect to the initial evaluation assigned, VA assesses the level of disability from the effective date of service connection. See Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Board observes that changes were made to several musculoskeletal rating codes in 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, effective February 7, 2021. However, the only change made to DC 5201 included an additional description that limited motion included flexion or abduction of the arm and specified that midway was 45 degrees and shoulder level was 90 degrees. 

The Veteran's service-connected right shoulder impingement syndrome has been rated under DC 5201 for limitation of motion of the arm. 

As set forth above, during the pendency of this appeal, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended, effective February 7, 2021. 85 Fed. Reg. 76,453, 76,464 (Nov. 30, 2020), revised, 85 Fed. Reg. 85,523 (Dec. 29, 2020), revised, 85 Fed. Reg. 8142 (Feb. 4, 2021). Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claims under both the former and revised rating criteria, and the more favorable criteria will be applied. If the revised criteria are more favorable, they will only be applied from February 7, 2021, when the regulations became effective.

Under the previous version of DC 5201, a rating of 20 percent is warranted when motion of the minor arm is limited to shoulder level. A 20 percent evaluation is warranted for limitation of motion of the minor arm midway between the side and shoulder level. A 30 percent rating contemplates limitation of motion of the minor arm to 25 degrees from the side. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5201 (2020).

The revised version of DC 5201 clarifies that a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees (shoulder level) in the minor arm and that a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees (midway between the side and shoulder level) in the minor arm. A 30 percent disability rating is warranted for flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from the side. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5201 (2021).

The Board notes that the revised version of DC 5201 clarifies the measurements for the various disability ratings by stating the measurements in terms of degrees. Thus, the revised version of DC 5201 does not contain any substantive changes.

DC 5201 provides ratings for both the "major" and the "minor" extremity. In this context, "major" and "minor" refer to the dominant and nondominant side. Here, the Veteran's major extremity (dominant) is the right upper extremity. In this case the Board observes that the right shoulder is the dominant, major extremity.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2018. The Va examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of right shoulder impingement syndrome. The Veteran asserted that his right shoulder condition had worsened with pain, stiffness, and diminished range of motion. The VA examiner stated the Veteran's right hand was his dominant hand. The Veteran reported flare-ups in his right shoulder and described them as exacerbations of pain and decreased range of motion and sharp pains with certain motions. The Veteran asserted that flare-ups could last weeks to months at a time. The Veteran reported having functional loss and impairment due to his right shoulder pain and limited motion. The VA examiner reported the Veteran's initial range of motion measurements for his right shoulder were abnormal. The Veteran's initial range of motion measurements were flexion at 0 to 100 degrees, abduction at 0 to 90 degrees, external rotation at 45 to 0 degrees, and internal rotation at 0 to 45 degrees. The VA examiner noted the Veteran was unable to perform an overhead reach. Pain was exhibited with flexion, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation and caused functional loss. There was evidence of localized mild tenderness on palpation of the distal acromion region. There was evidence of pain with weight bearing and objective evidence of crepitus. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions and there was additional loss of function and/or range of motion after three repetitions. The Veteran's range of motion measurements were flexion at 0 to 90 degrees, abduction at 0 to 70 degrees, external rotation at 0 to 35 degrees, and internal rotation at 0 to 20 degrees. Pain, fatigue, and lack of endurance caused functional loss. 

The Veteran was not being examined immediately after repetitive use over time. The VA examiner noted the examination was medically consistent with the Veteran's statements describing functional loss with repetitive use over time. Pain, fatigue, and lack of endurance caused functional loss with repeated use over a period of time. The VA examiner was able to describe in terms of Range of Motion. The described range of motion measurements were flexion at 0 to 90 degrees, abduction at 0 to 70 degrees, external rotation at 0 to 35 degrees, and internal rotation at 0 to 20 degrees. The Veteran was not being examined during a flare-up. The VA examiner noted the examination was medically consistent with the Veteran's statements describing functional loss during a flare-up. Pain, fatigue, and lack of endurance caused functional loss during a flare-up. The VA examiner was able to describe in terms of Range of Motion. The described range of motion measurements were flexion at 0 to 90 degrees, abduction at 0 to 70 degrees, external rotation at 0 to 35 degrees, and internal rotation at 0 to 20 degrees.

The Veteran's right shoulder muscle strength testing showed normal strength. The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy or ankylosis. The VA examiner noted there was a right shoulder rotator cuff condition suspected. The Veteran had a positive Hawkins' Impingement Test and Empty-Can Test, was unable to perform the External Rotation/Infraspinatus Strength Test, and a negative Lift-Off Subscapularis Test. The Veteran underwent a decompression and debridement surgery on his right shoulder in 1993 and 1995. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's right shoulder impingement syndrome impacted his ability to perform occupational tasks, noting the condition would adversely affect the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks requiring repetitive or strenuous use of the right shoulder for lifting, reaching, carrying, pushing, and pulling due to decreased motion, pain, fatigue, and lack of endurance. The VA examiner noted there was objective evidence of pain on passive range of motion testing and non-weight bearing testing of the right shoulder. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2019. The VA examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of right shoulder impingement syndrome. The Veteran asserted that he had undergone three surgeries on his right shoulder. The Veteran asserted limited function of his right shoulder causing him to perform more sedentary type work. The VA examiner stated the Veteran's right hand was his dominant hand. The Veteran reported that he did not suffer flare-ups in his right shoulder. The Veteran reported having functional loss and impairment due to his right shoulder pain and limited motion. The Veteran asserted that he could not work in maintenance, which he prefers, because of pain and limitations of shoulder range of motion. The VA examiner reported the Veteran's initial range of motion measurements for his right shoulder were abnormal. The Veteran's initial range of motion measurements were flexion at 0 to 100 degrees, abduction at 0 to 100 degrees, external rotation at 0 to 45 degrees, and internal rotation at 0 to 45 degrees. The VA examiner noted the Veteran was unable to lift his arm overhead and would not be able to work in a physically demanding job such as maintenance. Pain was exhibited with flexion, external rotation, and internal rotation and caused functional loss. There was evidence of pain with weight bearing. There was no evidence of localized mild tenderness on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue. There was objective evidence of crepitus. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions and there was no additional loss of function and/or range of motion after three repetitions. 

The Veteran was not being examined immediately after repetitive use over time. The VA examiner noted the examination was neither medically consistent nor inconsistent with the Veteran's statements describing functional loss with repetitive use over time. The VA examiner noted that pain significantly limited the Veteran's functional ability with repeated use over time. The examiner was not able to describe in terms of motion, noting the Veteran's range of motion remains intact and he only had an increase in pain that limited his ability to do maintenance work. The VA examiner noted the Veteran did not suffer from flare-ups. 

The Veteran's right shoulder muscle strength testing showed normal strength. The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy or ankylosis. The Veteran underwent an arthroscopic shoulder surgery in 2018. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's right shoulder impingement syndrome impacted his ability to perform occupational tasks, the Veteran's right shoulder impingement syndrome severely limited his baseline range of motion and pain. The Veteran was only able to perform sedentary work with no overhead lifting due to his pain. The VA examiner noted there was objective evidence of pain on passive range of motion testing and non-weight bearing testing of the right shoulder.

The probative evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran's right shoulder impingement syndrome has been productive of, at worst, limitation of flexion to 90 degrees, abduction to 70 degrees, pain, fatigue, and lack of endurance. The evidence does not demonstrate any findings of ankylosis of the arm. The VA examinations demonstrate the Veteran's right shoulder is the dominant (major) arm. Although additional limitations with observed repetitive use, repeated use over time, and during flare-ups were noted in the May 2018 VA examination, the November 2019 VA examination demonstrated no additional limitation of motion of the right arm upon repetitive motion, repetitive use over time or flare ups. Considering the findings above, the Board finds that the Veteran's right shoulder impingement syndrome more nearly approximates the criteria for the 20 percent disability rating currently assigned, under DC 5201.

Higher ratings for the shoulder and arm are available under other potentially applicable DCs, specifically DCs 5200 and 5202. However, the findings do not meet the criteria of a disability rating higher than the 20 percent disability rating already assigned under DC 5201. DC 5202 provides higher ratings for impairment of the humerus; however, as there are no findings in the left shoulder of fibrous union, nonunion (false flail joint) and loss of the head of (flail shoulder), a higher disability rating under DC 5202 is not warranted.

The Board also observes that there are no objective findings of record which demonstrate the right shoulder was in a fixed position in either flexion or abduction. By definition, then, he does not have the required ankylosis, favorable or unfavorable to be evaluated under DC 5200. See Dinsay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 79, 81 (1996) citing Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary at 86 (27th ed. 1988) (Ankylosis is "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure."); see also Coyalong v. West, 12 Vet. App. 524, 528 (1999); Lewis v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 259 (1992) [citing Saunders Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, and Allied Health at 68 (4th ed. 1987)].

The disability rating takes into account 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, as the right shoulder range of motion was, at worst, noted to be no more than 70 degrees of abduction and 90 degrees flexion, as found in the May 2018 VA examination, and a higher 30 percent disability rating for the major arm is only assigned when the arm is limited to 45 degrees of flexion or abduction from the side. Moreover, the November 2019 VA examination noted no additional limitation of motion with repetitive use, repetitive use over time and flare-ups. Accordingly, the Board has considered whether the additional limitation reflects changes that more nearly approximated the next higher rating criteria under DC 5200 or 5202 and are consistent with the decision in DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995). See also Voyles v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 451, 454 (1993); Johnston v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 80, 85 (1997); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011). In this case, the findings do not more nearly approximate limitation of the arm to 45 degrees from the side in flexion or abduction, ankylosis or fibrous union, nonunion (false flail joint) and loss of the head of (flail shoulder) of the humerus so as to warrant a higher rating under DCs 5200, 5201 or 5202.

The Board has considered the lay statements of record regarding the severity of the Veteran's right shoulder disability and has relied on these reports in determining appropriate disability ratings under the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. The Veteran is competent to report on factual matters of which he has firsthand knowledge and his statements regarding his symptoms are also credible, and thus, probative. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999). Where the Veteran has not discussed particular findings that are necessary for application to the rating criteria, the Board has afforded greater probative weight to objective medical findings of record which specifically address the rating criteria. See Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).

Accordingly, the Veteran's right shoulder impingement syndrome, does not warrant a disability rating in excess of the 20 percent currently assigned under DC 5201. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a; Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).
