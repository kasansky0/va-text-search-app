ORDER

The issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The most probative evidence of record establishes that the Veteran's current bilateral sensorineural hearing loss is related to in-service acoustic trauma.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1958 to July 1961.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2025 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The March 2025 rating decision was issued in response to a December 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, seeking review of a November 2024 rating decision. In its December 2024 Higher-Level Review decision, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error in the November 2024 decision and returned the case for further review. The AOJ then issued the March 2025 rating decision on appeal.

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record that the AOJ was permitted to consider at the time it issued the March 2025 rating decision on appeal (i.e., the evidence of record at the time it issued the November 2024 rating decision). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Finally, the Board notes that it is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, No. 21-7363 (U.S. Vet. App. June 21, 2024). The Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). At the time the Board received the Veteran's appeal, neither the one-year period following the March 2025 rating decision nor the 60-day period following receipt of the March 2025 Notice of Disagreement had passed. 

However, the Williams Court did not address the issue of whether an appeal being advanced on the Board's docket, as here, affects the operation of section 20.202(c).  In this case, the Veteran's appeal has been advanced on the docket due to his age.  To have him wait longer for a decision would contravene the principle and purpose of advancing a case on the docket, which is to expedite appellate review of a claim due to circumstances which warrant earlier consideration and determination of the case, such as the appellant being seriously ill or under severe financial hardship.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b).  The advanced age of an appellant, which VA regulation defines as 75 or more years of age, is also sufficient cause for advancing a case on the docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(1).  Furthermore, as the decision represents a full grant of the benefit requested, the Board finds that there will be no prejudice to the Veteran. Accordingly, in this case, the Board finds that notwithstanding the Court's holding in Williams, it may issue a decision in the Veteran's appeal before the time allotted for modifying the NOD under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c) has elapsed, as the appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period when new evidence was not allowed. To the extent the Board is granting the claim herein, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

For VA compensation purposes, hearing impairment is considered a disability when: (1) the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels (dB) or greater; (2) the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 or 4000 Hz are 26 dB or greater; or (3) the speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for certain chronic diseases, to include organic diseases of the nervous system (such as sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus), if there is competent and credible evidence demonstrating that: (1) the chronic disease was shown as such in service or within the one year presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3) and the same chronic disease manifests at any later date, however remote, unless it is clearly attributable to intercurrent causes; (2) it manifested to a compensable degree within one year presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3); or (3) if the condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, continuity of symptomatology after discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a), 3.309(a); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A lay person is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by their senses; however, usually, they are not competent to prove a matter requiring medical expertise. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

The issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss 

The Veteran contends that his hearing loss is due to noise exposure during service. See October 2024 VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application. 

In the March 2025 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran had a current diagnosis of hearing loss and that he was exposed to hazardous noise in service due to his military occupational specialty (MOS) of military policeman. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). No clear and unmistakable error has been shown by the evidence of record as to these favorable findings; therefore, the Board is bound by them. Id.

The Board notes that the Veteran's induction examination does not contain an audiogram, and the Veteran's separation examination occurred in June 1961, during a period of time when service audiograms may have been recorded using American Standards of Association (ASA) units. Presently, VA uses International Standards Organization American National Standards Institute (ISO-ANSI) units. There is no indication in the June 1961 Report of Medical Examination as to whether the ASA or ISO-ANSI units were applied. Thus, the Board considers the results contained in the June 1961 Report of Medical Examination require conversion from ASA to ISO-ANSI units. Audiometric testing at that time showed: 

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 10	10	10	- 	10

LEFT	10	10	10	- 	10

Assuming the above results were reported using ASA units, upon conversion to ISO-ANSI units, the results show:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	25 	20 	20 	-	15 

LEFT	25	20	20	- 	15

An October 1959 service treatment record (STR) further notes the Veteran's apparent impairment of hearing and referral to an ear nose and throat physician for an audiogram and profile.

In February 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination. The examiner conducted an in-person examination and noted diagnoses of hearing loss in both the right and left ears. The examiner noted that no audiogram was completed at the Veteran's entrance exam in October 1958, and that only a whisper test was conducted which is not a valid indicator of hearing loss.  The examiner noted the Veteran's June 1961 separation exam audiogram indicated normal hearing, which the examiner reasoned is objective evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty from the Veteran's conceded noise exposure. The examiner further reasoned that there is no report of complaints or treatment for hearing loss in the Veteran's STRs or at separation. Based on these findings, the examiner reasoned that although noise exposure is conceded, and the relationship of noise, auditory damage, and hearing loss is well-established, auditory damage and hearing loss are not conceded based on noise alone, and there was no nexus of auditory damage to relate current hearing loss to military noise. Therefore, the examiner concluded that it is less likely than not that the hearing loss is related to military noise exposure.

In February 2024, a VA examiner rendered an opinion as to whether the Veteran's confirmed participation in a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) caused or was otherwise related to his current bilateral hearing loss. The examiner opined that review of the medical and scientific literature did not demonstrate a definitive causal relationship between bilateral hearing loss and the TERAs experienced by the Veteran. The examiner therefore concluded that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERAs, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. 

In September 2024, the Veteran's private physician, Dr. C.P., submitted a medical nexus opinion as to the Veteran's hearing loss. The opinion noted bilateral hearing loss due to constant noise trauma in service without hearing protection, and no noise trauma before or after service, and further that the hearing loss was not age related. Dr. C.P. reviewed the Veteran's STRs and opined that the Veteran's hearing loss is more likely than not caused by or a result of his noise exposure in service. Dr. C.P. reasoned that he had treated the Veteran for more than eight years as his primary care physician. He stated that the Veteran suffers from service related hearing loss secondary to gunfire exposure. 

In November 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination. The examiner reviewed the Veteran's file and noted diagnoses of hearing loss in both ears. The examiner opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's hearing loss is related to military noise exposure. The examiner, similar to the February 2024 examiner, reasoned that no valid audiogram was completed at the Veteran's entrance exam, and the Veteran's June 1961 separation exam audiogram indicated normal hearing. The examiner reasoned that the separation audiogram is objective evidence of no permanent auditory damage from the conceded noise exposure. The examiner further reasoned that there is no report of complaints or treatment for hearing decrease in the Veteran's STRs or at separation. 

The Board finds the February 2024 direct service connection opinion and the November 2024 opinion to be inadequate as they were based on an inaccurate factual premise. In this regard, while the Veteran's separation examination did not indicate that he had impaired hearing for VA purposes at that time, such did reflect abnormal hearing, and was further incomplete, as it did not provide results at all required frequencies. Namely, testing was not performed at the 3000 Hz level and in fact showed abnormal hearing at the 500 Hz threshold. Normal hearing ranges are between zero and 20 decibels at any threshold, and higher numbers, even if not meeting the criteria for a disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, still constitute abnormal hearing.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993). Neither examiner addressed this or explained why the examination was a reliable indicator of normal hearing despite the lack of testing at the 3000 Hz threshold. Furthermore, the examiners did not note the Veteran's complaint of hearing loss in service. See id. at 160; Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise is not probative).

The Board finds the September 2024 private opinion to be probative, as it is based on over eight years of treatment of the Veteran, a review of the Veteran's STRs, and consideration of the Veteran's lay statements of noise exposure in service. See Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 473 (1993) ("the probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician reaches . . . . As is true with any piece of evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to these opinions [are] within the province of the [Board as] adjudicators . . .") In light of the above, the Board finds that the evidence weighs in favor of finding the Veteran's hearing loss is related to his noise exposure in service, and entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted.
