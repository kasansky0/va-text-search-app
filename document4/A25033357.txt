REMANDED

Entitlement to waiver of recovery of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits due to drill pay, to include whether the debt amount was validly created, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from March 2012 to December 2012 and from December 2015 to August 2016, with additional periods of Reserve duty.

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 Decision on Waiver of indebtedness, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to waiver of recovery of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits due to military drill pay, to include whether the debt amount was validly created, is remanded.

Although the Veteran asserts that waiver is appropriate due to undue financial hardship, the Board finds that pre-decisional duty to assist errors have been committed, and a remand is required to ascertain the correct amount of the debt before the issue of waiver may be addressed.  

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) to correct this pre-decisional duty-to-assist error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has directed that appellate review by the Board on the Veteran's waiver claim must be deferred pending formal adjudication of the Veteran's challenge to the validity of the debt by the AOJ. Schaper v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?430, 437 (1991).

In this case, the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (Committee) issued a denial of waiver in July 2022.  The Committee determined that the total indebtedness was $10,175.07 based on drill dates in fiscal years (FY) 2019, 2020, and 2021.  However, the only Demand Letter of record was issued in March 2022 in the amount of $8,740.00 for FY 2021; there are no Demand Letters for FY 2019 or FY 2020.  Moreover, the Veteran explicitly waived VA benefits for FY 2019, yet the total debt appears to include $1,564.92 for FY 2019.  

Due process requires that the Veteran be informed of the proper amount of the debt he owes, and the time period for which the debt was accrued, which was not done here.  Accordingly, a remand is necessary to validate the debt amount.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain and associate with the record any debt notification and Demand Letters regarding the Veteran's FY 2019 and 2020 military drill payments.  Provide copies to the Veteran and his representative.

2. Then, prepare an accounting regarding the VA compensation payments made to the Veteran in light of his drill pay and in light of his explicit waiver of FY 2019 VA compensation pay.  Provide the accounting to the Veteran and his representative.

3. If any valid overpayment to the Veteran is shown, complete the necessary development to adjudicate the Veteran's request for waiver of recovery of any overpayment.
