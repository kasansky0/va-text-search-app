Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's January 2021 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal expressed disagreement with a July 2020 rating decision which deferred decisions on service connection for bilateral hearing loss and service connection for tinnitus.

2. There is no specific error of fact or law at issue.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to July 1971 and from April 1978 to May 1986.

This case is being reviewed according to the appellate process set forth under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA). This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with a VA decision on their claim to seek review.  This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 2020 rating decision of VA.  In his January 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket, pursuant to AMA.

The Veteran appeared at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in January 2025.  A transcript of the hearing is in the Veteran's file.  The Board notes that it may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the January 2025 hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). 

Dismissed Claims

In the July 2020 rating action, the Regional Office (RO) deferred adjudication of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  The Veteran submitted a January 2021 VA Form 10182 expressing disagreement with the July 2020 action that deferred adjudication of both claimed disabilities and requested a Board hearing.  The Veteran was afforded a Board hearing in January 2025. 

The Board notes that in a January 2024 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for both bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  The Veteran submitted the January 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal challenging the July 2020 action which deferred a decision as to whether service connection was warranted.  This action taken by the RO was not final as to the specific issues and did not constitute an adjudicative determination from which a NOD could be filed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.201; Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011) (concluding that a deferred rating decision does not constitute an appealable adjudicative action).  Because the July 2020 rating decision was not final, the Board does not have jurisdiction to decide that claim.  There is no specific error of fact or law at issue.  As such, the appeal is dismissed.

In addition, although the claims for entitlement to service connection for both bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus were subsequently adjudicated, the premature filing of the January 2021 VA Form 10182 filing is not a valid appeal of the subsequent January 2024 rating decision.  

For the foregoing reason, the Board finds that the Veteran's appeal of the deferred issues must be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104(a), 20.105.
