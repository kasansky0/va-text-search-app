ORDER

Service connection for primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), as a variant of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has a diagnosis of PLS, a variant of ALS, which developed after separation from service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for PLS are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.318.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from January 10, 1972, to April 20, 1972, a period of more than 90 days.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Board notes that less than one year has elapsed since August 13, 2024, the mailing of notice of the August 2024 rating decision on appeal. Generally, the Board may not decide an appeal prior to the expiration of the one-year period. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). However, as the Board herein grants the benefit sought on appeal in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

There is a presumption of service connection for veterans who develop ALS at any time after separation from service, unless (1) there is affirmative evidence it was not incurred in, or aggravated by, service; (2) there is affirmative evidence that it is due to the Veteran's willful misconduct; or (3) the Veteran did not have continuous active service of 90 days or more. 38 C.F.R. § 3.318.

In this case, the Board contends that his PLS warrants service connection pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.318 because it is a variant of ALS. He has submitted medical evidence to that effect. The Board agrees and grants service connection on that basis. See March 2025 Appellate Brief.

The Veteran has a diagnosis of PLS. See May 2024 VA examination; February 2024 VA treatment note. 

The Veteran, through his representative, has provided competent medical literature classifying PLS as a subset of ALS and as the "rarest form of ALS." Moreover, the Veteran is prescribed an ALS medication and receives treatment at VA's ALS clinic. 

To the extent that VA obtained a medical opinion from an examiner who opined against a relationship between PLS and service, the examiner did not consider whether PLS was a variant of ALS and as such, the Board affords the medical opinion no probative value. See May 2024 VA opinion. 

Based on the provided medical literature, and after affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that PLS is a variant of ALS. The Board further finds that there is no affirmative evidence that the Veteran's PLS was not incurred in or aggravated by service. There is no affirmative evidence that the Veteran's PLS was due to his willful misconduct. And the evidence shows that the Veteran had continuous active service of 90 days or more.

Accordingly, as the Veteran meets all the requirements for presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.318, entitlement to service connection for PLS is granted.
