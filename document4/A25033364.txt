ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for depression and insomnia is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran was granted service connection for adjustment disorder with depressed mood to include insomnia, effective March 24, 2024, the day after his discharge from active service.  This represents a full grant of the benefit sought.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for depression and insomnia have been met.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2020 to March 2024.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

The Board notes that the Veteran was granted service connection for adjustment disorder with depressed mood to include insomnia, effective March 24, 2024, the day after his discharge from active service.  See November 2024 Rating Decision; DD-214.  This represents a full grant of the benefit sought and there is no case or controversy for the Board to adjudicate. Consequently, the claim is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; see also Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1977).
