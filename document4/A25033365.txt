DOCKET NO. 240416-514424
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The April 16, 2024, request for an extension of time to file an appeal from a contested claim decision issued on January 26, 2024 that denied apportionment to the Appellant is denied, and the attempted appeal is therefore dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Appellant did not timely file a Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) with respect to the contested claim decision issued on January 26, 2024 that denied apportionment to the Appellant, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The April 16, 2024, Board Appeal request is not timely with respect to the contested claim decision issued on January 26, 2024, that denied apportionment to the Appellant, and the criteria for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500(g), 20.202, 20.203, 20.402. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1984 to December 1984. The Appellant is the Veteran's spouse, who submitted a June 2023 claim for apportionment, which is a contested claim. She filed an April 16, 2024, Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the January 26, 2024 apportionment decision and selected the Direct Review docket. 

Timeliness of an Appeal

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed NOD on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. However, for contested claims, parties have only 60 days from the date of mailing of notification of the determination to appeal the issue to the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§20.202(g)(1)(ii), 20.401, 20.402.

A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of an NOD shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C). An extension of the period for filing an NOD may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). 

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019).  

Timeliness of the April 16, 2024, Board Appeal request.  

On April 16, 2014, the Appellant filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the contested claim decision issued on January 26, 2024 that denied apportionment to the Appellant. The Appellant asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal because VA did not provide an appeal form in a timely manner after she requested it several times. See April 16, 2024 Statement. 

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the January 26, 2024 decision. 

The decision issued on January 26, 2024 denied apportionment to the Appellant. The Appellant was notified of the decision in the January 26, 2024, letter that included appeal rights, timeline and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board, including the 60-day deadline for filing an appeal. The letter was sent to the Appellant's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable.

The Appellant's April 16, 2024 Board Appeal request was not timely filed because it was received more than 60 days after the contested claim decision issued on January 26, 2024 that denied apportionment to the Appellant. In an attached statement, the Appellant stated that VA did not provide an appeal form in a timely manner after she had requested one several times. 

The Board acknowledges the Appellant's argument that good cause exists for an extension to appeal the January 26, 2024 decision because VA did not provide the appeal form in a timely manner after requesting it several times. However, the record does not appear to contain evidence that the Appellant requested an appeal form after the January 26, 2024 decision was issued. As noted above, the January 26, 2024, notification letter instructed the Appellant to file an appeal to the Board within 60 days and told the Appellant that the appropriate form was the VA Form 10182. VA Form 20-0998, Your Rights to Seek Further Review of Our Decision, was also included with the notification letter and provided a phone number to call, websites to visit to fill out the forms, and QR codes to scan to automatically bring up the appropriate decision review website. While the record shows that the Appellant contacted VA to request forms related to filing the initial apportionment claim, as noted above, it does not show that any such requests were made to VA and not responded to following the decision issued on January 26, 2024. Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran's argument unpersuasive. In this case, the Appellant's assertions do not provide good cause for why her appeal of the January 26, 2024 decision was not timely filed, nor why it could not have been filed sooner than it was. 

Accordingly, the April 16, 2024 Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the January 26, 2024 rating decision denying apportionment to the Appellant, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension request is denied, and the attempted appeal is dismissed.
