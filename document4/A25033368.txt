DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for right hip ligament strain with thigh impairment is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent disabling for right hip ligament strain with limitation of flexion is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for migraines is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right hip ligament strain with thigh impairment was characterized by full abduction (45 degrees), full adduction (25 degrees, full internal rotation (40 degrees), and full external rotation (70 degrees).

2. The Veteran's right hip ligament strain with limitation of flexion was characterized by 90 degrees of flexion, including after repetitive use testing and repeated use over time, and painful motion.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had migraines at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had GERD at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable disability rating for right hip ligament strain with thigh impairment have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent disabling for right hip ligament strain with limitation of flexion have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252.

3. The criteria for service connection for migraines are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for service connection for GERD are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1992 to June 1996.

The August 2023 rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the September 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

VA regulations provide that, "[u]pon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim... before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim." 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1). That regulation does not indicate that the claimant is entitled to pre-decisional notice of this optional hearing. In fact, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1) provides that, following a decision, "[c]laimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief... [including] the right to a hearing on any issue involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d) of this section...." Read together with § 3.103(d), the only notice § 3.103(b) requires is that a claimant be provided notice of the right for a hearing with notification of the decision (by definition, a post-decisional notice). In November 2022, VA amended VA Form 21-526EZ and in May 2024 VA amended VA Form 20-0995 to inform claimants of the right to a hearing at any time during the claims process.  The claims in this appeal were filed on September 2019 versions of the VA Form 21-526EZ. However, the Board finds that any error in the failure to inform the Veteran of the right to a pre-decisional hearing before the Regional Office (RO) was harmless error. 

In Bowen, the Court found that when a claimant is denied a hearing before the RO, there is no due process violation if he is subsequently offered the opportunity for a hearing before the Board, even if a hearing was not requested or conducted, as long as there is no violation of due process concerning the Board hearing opportunity. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253-4 (2012). The facts in the case can be differentiated on several levels, to include that the Veteran did not actually request an RO hearing and the issue in Bowen was not one of notice. Regardless, the Board cannot find a basis to conclude that the underlying holding and logic of the Bowen case would not lead to the same finding of no prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case. The August 2023 notification letter informing the Veteran of the rating decision included a VA Form 20-0998, Your Right to Seek Review of Our Decision, outlining the Veteran's appeal options, to include a hearing before the Board. Additionally, in the September 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran was provided with an option to request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge. The Veteran instead selected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, the Veteran does not want a Board hearing. Because the Veteran was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation in the processing of the claim or any suggestion that the Veteran was prejudiced by the failure of VA to provide a hearing at the RO level. See Bowen.

In a December 2020 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for right hip ligament strain with limitation of extension (rated 10 percent), right hip ligament strain with limitation of flexion (rated 10 percent), and "right hip ligament strain with impairment of" (rated noncompensable).  This latter rating referred to DC 5253 which relates to impairments of the thigh and is rated based on limitation of abduction, adduction, and/or internal/external rotation.  Since the decision on appeal, the RO has corrected the apparent typo of "impairment of" to refer to "right hip ligament strain with thigh impairment." 

The period on appeal is from May 10, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's May 2023 VA 21-526EZ, to August 17, 2023, the date of the rating decision on appeal.  As the claims addressed on the merits below are increased rating claims, the period on appeal also includes up to one year prior to the date of claim if an increase in disability warranting a higher rating was first ascertainable within that year.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

1. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for right hip ligament strain thigh impairment 

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating but has not set forth any arguments (other than duty to assist arguments set forth below) and has not identified or submitted any evidence that would support the higher rating claim.

The Veteran's right hip ligament strain with thigh impairment is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253, and a 10 percent rating is warranted for limitation of rotation of affected leg, cannot toe out more than 15 degrees.  A 10 percent rating is also warranted for limitation of adduction, cannot cross legs.  A maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of abduction, motion lost beyond 10 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for the Veteran's right hip ligament strain with impairment of the thigh.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that "prolonged sitting, standing, and walking result in right hip pain, but does not cause decreased range of motion."  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the Veteran's description of functional impact would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating limitation of rotation of affected leg, with inability to toe out more than 15 degrees or limitation of adduction with inability to cross legs.

The August 2023 VA examination documented the Veteran's report that "prolonged sitting, standing, and walking result in right hip pain, but does not cause decreased range of motion."  The examiner noted the Veteran did not report flare-ups.  Range of motion measurements revealed 90 degrees of flexion, 30 degrees of extension, 45 degrees of abduction (i.e. full abduction), 25 degrees of adduction (i.e. full adduction), 70 degrees of external rotation (i.e. full external rotation), and 40 degrees of internal rotation (i.e. full internal rotation).  There was pain on flexion, extension, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation.  Limitation of adduction did not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs.  Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion.  The Veteran reported tenderness in the interior and lateral aspects of the right hip.  There were no additional limitations after repetitive use testing.  There were no additional factors contributing to disability.  The examiner indicated that there were no flare-ups and that functional ability of the right hip was not limited by pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination with repeated use over time.  There was no muscle atrophy or ankylosis.  There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to the right hip ligament strain.  The Veteran did not use assistive devices.  The examiner opined that the right hip ligament strain did impact his ability to perform some occupational tasks in that the Veteran may not be able to tolerate doing jobs that require prolonged sitting, standing, and/or walking.

VA treatment records are consistent with the above and do not provide any findings or range of motion measurements which would support any finding any greater limitation of motion or functional impairment than indicated by the August 2023 VA examination.

The August 2023 VA examination revealed abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation well in excess of the ranges of motion that would support a compensable rating under DC 5253.  

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the hip and thigh.  Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); see also Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment).  

Here, the Veteran already has 10 percent ratings under DCs 5251 (extension) and DC 5252 (flexion), the former of which is not on appeal and the latter of which is discussed below.  Importantly, both of those compensable ratings are based on painful motion pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  See October 2020 Rating Decision (granting a 10 percent rating for limitation of extension based on pain on motion), August 2023 Rating Decision (granting a 10 percent rating for limitation of flexion based on pain on motion).  While it is unclear whether two compensable ratings under DCs 5251 and 5252 should have been assigned for painful motion of the hip, that is a favorable finding by the RO and will not be disturbed by the Board.  However, no additional rating is warranted pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 for painful motion of the right hip as the two 10 percent ratings under DCs 5251 and 5252 already take into account the effects of painful motion of the right hip and adequately compensate the Veteran for the limitations associated with that painful motion.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); see also VA Gen. Coun. Prec. 9-2004 (Sep. 17, 2004) ("[T]he key consideration in determining whether rating under more than one diagnostic code is in order is whether the ratings under different diagnostic codes would be based on the same manifestation of disability or whether none of the symptomatology upon which the separate ratings would be based is duplicative or overlapping.").

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's appeal for a compensable rating for the right hip ligament strain with limitation of the thigh with impairment of abduction, adduction, and rotation.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent disabling for right hip ligament strain with limitation of flexion

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating but has not set forth any arguments (other than duty to assist arguments set forth below) and has not identified or submitted any evidence that would support the higher rating claim.

The Veteran's right hip ligament strain with limitation of flexion is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252, and a 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 20 degrees.  A maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 10 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252.  

The relevant regulations and principles relating to applying the rating criteria are set forth above and will not be repeated.  Likewise, the relevant medical examinations and findings were also set forth above in the discussion of the right hip ligament strain with thigh impairment.  

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip ligament strain with impairment of flexion.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and including that he has pain after prolonged sitting, standing, and walking.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and associated functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by those statements would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating flexion limited to 30 degrees.  In fact, as set forth above, the actual ranges of motion of the right hip well exceed the ranges which would warrant a compensable rating under DCs 5251, 5252, or 5253.  With respect to flexion, the Veteran has 90 degrees of flexion which, although less than the 125 degrees of flexion for full range of motion, well exceeds the limitation to 45 degrees which would warrant a 10 percent rating.  As already noted, the RO awarded a 10 percent rating under DC 5252 pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 despite the Veteran's limitations not meeting the criteria for a compensable rating based on limitation of flexion.  No higher rating is warranted for the service-connected right hip ligament strain with limitation of flexion.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the hip and thigh.  Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); see also Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment). 

As discussed above, the Veteran has a compensable rating under DC 5251 in addition to the ratings on appeal.  A higher 20 percent rating under DC 5252 is not warranted for painful motion given that painful motion has already been considered and adequately compensated by the award of 10 percent ratings under DCs 5251 and 5252.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban, 6 Vet. App. at 261-62.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's appeal for a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip ligament strain with impairment of flexion.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

3. Entitlement to service connection for migraines

The Veteran has asserted entitlement to service connection for migraines, but has not, in any of his filings prior to the August 2023 rating decision on appeal, explained the basis of this claim, to include any alleged symptoms of a current disability, the in-service event to which any current alleged disability is related, or how or why the Veteran believes any alleged symptoms are related to an alleged in-service event.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ (merely listing "Migraines" as a claim).

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of migraines at the time of the decision on appeal and or at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran has not had a VA examination with respect to the claimed migraines, but there is no "competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability."  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).  As noted above, the Veteran has not submitted any statements during an applicable evidentiary window indicating that he has a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability.  Moreover, the available treatment records during the applicable evidentiary window (prior to August 17, 2023) repeatedly document denials that the Veteran had current headache symptoms.  See January 2022 VA Progress Note ("No headache or recent head trauma."); March 2023 VA Progress Note ("No headache or recent head trauma."); May 2022 VA Progress Note ("No headache or recent head trauma."); June 2022 VA Progress Note ("The patient reports no new onset of headache, loss of taste or loss of smell.").  The Board acknowledges the May 2023 VA Primary Care Note which documents that the Veteran "states he has a headache and feels tired", but the Veteran was not diagnosed with any headache condition or condition that causes headaches, was not treated for the headache, and the record otherwise fails to indicate the headache was the symptom of a current disability.

The Board acknowledges the October 2023 correspondence from the Veteran's representative which presents argument, to include references to medical treatises/articles, in support of various secondary theories of service connection for migraine headaches.  This correspondence is inadequate to create a duty to assist issue on appeal.  First, the correspondence was submitted after the August 2023 rating decision and, so, to the extent it contains evidence it cannot be considered.  Second, because it was submitted after the August 2023 rating decision, there is no pre-decisional duty to assist error in failing to conduct additional development (e.g., obtain an expert opinion) based on the arguments or theories raised by the correspondence.  None of these theories were either explicitly raised nor implicitly raised by the evidence prior to the decision on appeal. Third, and notwithstanding the foregoing, the evidentiary record, which closed at the time of the August 2023 rating decision, did not contain any lay or medical evidence that the Veteran has a current disability consisting of or characterized by headaches.  Thus, the record contains no competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability consisting of or characterized by headaches.

The evidence is not in approximate balance, but is persuasively against the claim, therefore there is not reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

4. Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 

The Veteran has asserted entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but has not, in any of his filings prior to the August 2023 rating decision on appeal, explained the basis of this claim, to include any alleged symptoms of a current disability, the in-service event to which any current alleged disability is related, or how or why the Veteran believes any alleged symptoms are related to an alleged in-service event.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ (merely listing "GERD" as a claim).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of GERD at the time of the decision on appeal and did not have one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. at 294; McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321.

The Veteran has not had a VA examination with respect to the claimed GERD, but there is no "competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability."  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 81.  As noted above, the Veteran has not submitted any statements during an applicable evidentiary window indicating that he has a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability consisting of or characterized by GERD or GERD-like symptoms.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346 (2022) (listing symptoms including vomiting, hematemesis, melena, epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, regurgitation, and substernal, arm, or shoulder pain).

Moreover, the available treatment records during the applicable evidentiary window (prior to August 17, 2023) repeatedly document denials that the Veteran has current GERD-like symptoms.  See January 2022 VA Progress Note (indicating the absence of abdominal pain, dysphagia, melena, and hematemesis as well as being silent for other GERD-like symptoms including pyrosis, regurgitation, or substernal, arm, or shoulder pain); May 2022 VA Progress Note (same); March 2023 VA Progress Note (same). The last VA record noting GERD was from 2010, which is simply too far remote from 2023 to establish a current disability.

The Board acknowledges the October 2023 correspondence from the Veteran's representative which presents argument, to include references to medical treatises/articles, in support of various secondary theories of service connection for GERD.  This correspondence is inadequate to create a duty to assist issue on appeal.  First, the correspondence was submitted after the August 2023 rating decision and, so, to the extent it contains evidence it cannot be considered.  Second, because it was submitted after the August 2023 rating decision, there is no pre-decisional duty to assist error in failing to conduct additional development (e.g., obtain an expert opinion) based on the arguments or theories raised by the correspondence. None of these theories were either explicitly raised nor implicitly raised by the evidence prior to the decision on appeal. Third, and notwithstanding the foregoing, the evidentiary record, which closed at the time of the August 2023 rating decision, did not contain any lay or medical evidence that the Veteran has a current disability consisting of or characterized by GERD or GERD-like symptoms.  Thus, the record contains no competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability consisting of or characterized by GERD or GERD-like symptoms.

The evidence is not in approximate balance, but is persuasively against the claim, therefore there is not reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Duties to Notify and Assist

This appeal is being adjudicated under the modernized system (AMA).  The reasons for remand by the Board in the modernized review system are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

In October 2023 correspondence, the Veteran's representative requested the qualifications of the VA examiner who conducted the August 2023 VA examination. In Francway v. Wilkie, the Federal Circuit held that "[o]nce the request is made for information as to the competency of the examiner, the veteran has the right, absent unusual circumstances, to the curriculum vitae and other information about qualifications of a medical examiner," "mandated by VA's duty to assist." 940 F.3d 1304, 1308 (2019). The Board, however, has no duty to assist under the AMA. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c). As the request for the examiner's CV was not received prior to issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, there was no duty to assist error on VA's part in not fulfilling the request, and remand is not proper.  The Board will refer the request to VBA for processing; however, as such a request does not ask for records that are part of the claims file, it is not considered a Privacy Act request and the Board can proceed to decide this appeal. 

The Veteran has not raised any other specific issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist, much less any pre-decisional errors or errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
