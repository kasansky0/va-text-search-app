DOCKET NO. 240504-437712
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On May 4, 2024, the Veteran filed separate VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreements appealing December 2023 and April 2024 rating decisions which both denied an evaluation in excess of 70 percent for PTSD; these are concurrent appeals.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for an evaluation in excess of 70 percent for PTSD under Docket 240504-437712  are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1977 to May 1980 and from January 1991 to May 1991. These matters come before the Board on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The Veteran also appealed an April 2024 rating decision which denied an evaluation in excess of 70 percent for PTSD by submitting a separate VA Form 10182 on the same day in May 2024.  Both appeals elected the Direct Review docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

Under the Direct Review Docket, the Board considers the same evidentiary record as that considered by the AOJ in reaching the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Regulations prohibit concurrent appeals. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). The appeal for an increased evaluation for PTSD cannot exist in two simultaneous appeal streams. Accordingly, one of the entirely duplicative appeals must be dismissed. Moreover, because the election of the Direct docket limits the evidence to be considered by the Board, it is to the Veteran's advantage to appeal the decision allowing the greatest evidentiary window. This, the appeal stream established based on the December 2023 decision, would exclude consideration of supporting evidence submitted by the Veteran in connection with the Supplemental Claim which led to the April 2024 decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  This would be disadvantageous, the Board therefore finds this appeal stream under Docket 240504-437712, stemming from a December 2023 decision, is the duplicate, concurrent appeal, and must be dismissed due to a claims processing error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

The Board emphasizes that the decision herein does not affect the earlier docketed pending appeal for an increased evaluation in excess of 70 percent for PTSD. Rather, the Board is merely dismissing a duplicate appeal of the same issue.
