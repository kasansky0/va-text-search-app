REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 18, 2018 for service connection for lumbar spine degenerative arthritis is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from October 1992 to October 1996 and the United States Army from April 1997 to January 25, 2010.  A March 2011 VA Administrative Decision found that the Veteran was eligible for VA benefits for his service between October 20, 1992 to October 19, 1996 and for his period of service from April 17, 1997 to October 14, 2003.  However, the Administrative Decision also found that his service from October 15, 2003 to January 25, 2010 was dishonorable for VA purposes.  Accordingly, he is not entitled to VA compensation benefits for this period of service.  See March 2011 Administrative Decision regarding Character of Discharge; Codesheet June, 12, 2024.

Applicable Evidentiary Windows

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Under the Direct Review docket, the Board is authorized to review only the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the March 2024 rating decision.  The Board may not consider evidence presented outside of the timeframes discussed above.  Evidence provided following the March 2024 rating decision has not been considered by the Board in its decision on the claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran submitted a statement with the April 2024 VA Form 10182 that selected the Direct Review docket.  See April 2024 VA Form 21-4138.  Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), if a Veteran elects the Direct Review docket, only argument - not evidence - can be considered after the AOJ decision on appeal.  The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) recently held that if a Veteran submits evidence with a VA Form 10182 but selects the direct review docket, VA is required to clarify with that Veteran that he intended to proceed with direct review by the Board.  Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023).  Here, the statement submitted with the VA Form 10182 is argument only and presents no new evidence; thus, clarification is not required.  The Board will proceed to adjudicate the matter on appeal.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 18, 2018 for service connection for lumbar spine degenerative arthritis is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for lumbar spine disability.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date of March 23, 2010 which is the date the Veteran was discharged from service.  See April 2024 VA Form 21-4138.

The effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, shall be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).  An effective date for a reopened claim of entitlement to service connection can be no earlier than the date the request to reopen the claim was filed.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(1)(ii).

For secondary service connection claims, which are governed by the more general statute, if the date of receipt of claim falls within one year after separation from service, the effective date will be the day following separation from active service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Otherwise, the effective date cannot be earlier than the date of receipt of claim for service connection on a secondary basis.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (requirements in 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a) that secondary conditions "be considered a part of [an] original condition," does not mean a claim for secondary service connection will be assigned the same effective date as the claim for service connection for the primary disability); Ross v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 528, 532-33 (2008).  In other words, when service connection is granted for a secondary disability, it is considered part of the original disability, meaning the effective date for a secondary disability cannot predate the effective date for the primary disability from which the secondary disability was derived.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Ellington v. Nicholson, 22 Vet. App. 141, 145 (2007), aff'd sub nom. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Ross v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 528, 532-33 (2008).

Generally, a decision that is not appealed becomes final one year after the claimant is notified of the decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103.  A final rating decision is not subject to revision on the same factual basis except by duly constituted appellate authorities, or when the decision contains clear and unmistakable error (CUE) as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(a).  However, the key point here is "after the claimant is notified."  A rating decision does not become final and binding until written notification of the decision is issued to the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.104(a), 3.160(d), 19.25; see also Adams v. Shinseki, 568 F.3d 956, 960 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (a claim will be considered to be pending if VA has failed to notify the claimant of the denial of his claim or of his right to appeal an adverse decision) (citing to Cook v. Principi, 318 F.3d 1334, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (en banc)); Tablazon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 359, 361 (1995) (finding that a rating decision did not become final because no SOC was issued after a NOD was timely submitted); Hauck v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1994).

It is typically assumed that VA has timely issued notification of rating decisions to claimants.  The presumption of regularity provides that, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the Court will presume that public officers have properly discharged their official duties.  Miley v. Principi, 366 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The presumption has been applied to the Government's mailing of certain types of notices.  See e.g., Crain v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 182, 186 (2003) ("The law presumes the regularity of the administrative process...."); Davis v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 29, 37 (2003) (applying a "presumption of regularity of mailing").  The presumption of regularity is rebutted by submission of clear evidence to the contrary.  Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307, 309 (1992) (quoting Rosler v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 241, 242 (1991)).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.  When a Veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the Veteran prevails.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A brief history is necessary here.  The Veteran filed his initial claim for a back disability in December 2008 during the pendency of his discharge.  See December 2008 VA Form 21-526.  This claim was denied in a September 2011 rating decision.  The Veteran was notified of this decision in September 2011.  See September 2011 Notification Letter.  The Veteran did not appeal or present new and material evidence within the year following the September 2011 rating decision.  Further, there is no indication from the Veteran or his representative that he did not receive either the September 2011 rating decision or the notification letter and neither were returned to VA as undeliverable.  As such, the presumption of regularity is not rebutted, and the September 2011 rating decision is considered final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103.

The Board notes that the August 2023 Board decision which remanded this claim also found the September 2011 rating decision to be final.  See August 2023 BVA Decision.

The Board has a duty to maximize a Veteran's benefits.  Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162, 167 (2019).  Further, the Board has a duty to liberally read filings within a claim.  Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  Based on those duties, the Board will recharacterize this claim to include an appeal of the denial of direct service connection for the lumbar spine disability by the AOJ.  This recharacterization is consistent with the Veteran's claim that his disability is based on his active duty service.  See April 2024 VA Form 21-4138.

The claim for service connection for a back disability was most recently before the Board in August 2023 where it was remanded for additional development.  See August 2023 BVA decision.  Following this development, the AOJ, without explanation, split the claim into two separate issues.  First, in a March 2024 rating decision, service connection for a back disability was granted as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected bilateral foot disability with an assigned effective date of June 18, 2018.  However, the March 2024 rating decision specifically noted that this is only a partial grant of the benefit sought and that the claim would remain in appellate status unless the Veteran indicated that he was satisfied with the decision.  See March 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran filed a statement that he was not satisfied with the decision.  See March 2024 VA Form 21-4138.  Second, in a separate document, the AOJ addressed whether an earlier effective date was warranted.  The AOJ explained that as the claim was granted on a secondary basis it could not award an effective date prior to June 18, 2018.  See March 2024 SSOC.

This second earlier effective date decision was based on a February 2024 VA medical opinion which provided the positive secondary opinion necessary to justify the secondary service connection grant within the March 2024 rating decision.  The Board considers this a favorable finding that will not be disturbed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  However, this medical opinion also provided a direct service connection medical opinion.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's back disability is less likely than not incurred in or caused by service.  As rationale, the examiner noted a lack of substantiating evidence sufficient to support a nexus without chronicity during service or after service.  As such, the examiner opined that a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered a more likely etiology.

The Board finds this February 2024 medical opinion regarding direct service connection inadequate.  First, the examiner provides only a conclusory determination that the evidence does not support a nexus.  The examiner does not reference what specific evidence led the examiner to this negative conclusion.  Further, no potential etiology and its medical basis was provided as justification.  A mere recitation of the review of the medical records is not sufficient for adjudicative purposes.  Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012) (medical examination reports are adequate "when they sufficiently inform the Board of a medical expert's judgment on a medical question and the essential rationale for that opinion"); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007) (The Board may reject a medical opinion that is conclusory and lacks supporting analysis); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 240-42 (2012) (stating that under caselaw "an unexplained conclusory opinion is entitled to no weight in a service-connection context").  Second, the examiner impermissibly conflated continuity of treatment either during or after service with continued symptomology since service.  Further, the examiner did not address the Veteran's reports of incurrence during service.  Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 496 (1997) ("symptoms, not treatment, are the essence of any evidence of continuity of symptomatology") (Examiners must address the Veteran's competent reports of chronic symptoms since service, without consideration as to any lack of continuous treatment); Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (an examination was inadequate where the examiner did not comment on a Veteran's reports of in-service injury and instead relied on the absence of evidence in a Veteran's service treatment records to provide a negative opinion).  As this medical opinion is based on conclusory opinions, and fails to address the Veteran's lay statements, the Board finds the February 2024 medical opinion regarding direct service connection to be inadequate.

There are no other adequate private or VA medical opinions of record regarding direct service connection.

While the Board regrets the additional delay this remand brings, there is no adequate medical opinion of record regarding direct service connection and the AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate direct service connection medical opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  The Board finds this claim must be remanded to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error and to obtain an adequate VA examination and medical opinion regarding direct service connection for the Veteran's back disability.

In providing this remand, the Board makes no determination, express or implied, regarding the credibility of any statements within the record.  Smith v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 332 (2020).

Finally, the Board finds that the earlier effective date claim based on secondary service connection is inextricably intertwined with the Veteran's claim for direct service connection for a lumbar spine disability.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (holding that where a claim is inextricably intertwined with another claim, the claims must be adjudicated together in order to enter a final decision on the matter).  Therefore, the claim for earlier effective date for the grant of secondary service connection for the back disability is not ripe for adjudication at this time and is remanded pending the outcome of the direct service connection claim for the Veteran's back condition.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an in-person examination and medical opinion with a NEW clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's back disability as it relates to direct service connection and whether such direct service connection was related to an honorable period of service.  The claims file, including this remand, must be made available to the examiner.  The examiner must document that a full and thorough review of the record, to include this remand, has been completed.  The examiner must also document review of the Veteran's VA administrative decision regarding the Veteran's eligible periods of service for VA benefits.

For the purpose of providing the opinion requested, please acknowledge, and discuss:

a)	Whether the Veteran's back disability was incurred in or caused by active service.

b)	If the Veteran's back disability was incurred in or caused by active service, indicate whether such active service was during the Veteran's periods of honorable service or during the period of dishonorable service.  Please provide a full medical explanation for this determination.

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and injuries, as well as diagnoses provided to him by physicians, and that his reports (lay observations) must be considered in formulating the requested opinion.

If the Veteran's statements are discounted, the examiner should provide a full, medically explained reason for doing so.  The Veteran's statements or lay statements may not be discounted solely on the basis of the lack of confirmation in the medical or service records.

The examiner may not mistakenly rely on an absence of medical evidence in the record to support his or her conclusions.?

A complete and fully explanatory rationale must be provided for any and all opinions expressed.  If the examiner finds that the requested opinion cannot be rendered without resorting to speculation, he or she should so state, and should indicate whether the need to speculate is caused by a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (i.e., no one could respond given the state of medical science and the known facts) or by a deficiency in the record (i.e., additional facts are required), or that the examiner does not have the necessary knowledge or training.

When responding, regardless of whether favorably or unfavorably, it is essential the examiner provide rationale preferably citing to evidence in the file and/or accepted medical authority in order to support the conclusions asserted.  An unsupported medical opinion will carry negligible probative weight.
