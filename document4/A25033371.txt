ORDER

The appeal for service connection for right acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis with gout is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a December 2024 written statement, the Veteran withdrew the appeal for service connection for right acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis with gout.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for service connection for right acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis with gout have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 1986 to June 1991.

In August 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for right acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis with gout.  In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.

Withdrawal

In a December 2024 written statement, the Veteran stated that he "would like to formally withdraw" his October 2024 appeal for service connection for right acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis with gout. 

A veteran may withdraw a substantive appeal in writing at any time prior to the Board of Veterans' Appeals' (Board) promulgation of a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  The Board finds that the Veteran has effectively withdrawn the appeal for service connection for right acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis with gout.  Therefore, the Board concludes that no allegation of fact or law remains as to that issue, and the appeal must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.
