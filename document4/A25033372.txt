REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from June 1979 to July 1983.  His service was under honorable conditions. 

The matter is on appeal from October 2014 and May 2015 rating decisions issued by a VA Regional Office (RO). 

In a September 2018 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) increased the rating for the left lower extremity radiculopathy disability from 10 to 20 percent, effective from November 17, 2005, to November 20, 2014; increased the rating for the right lower extremity radiculopathy disability from 10 to 20 percent, effective from November 17, 2005, to November 20, 2014; granted a TDIU from November 21, 2014; and granted based eligibility for DEA benefits from November 21, 2014. 

In a February 2021 rating decision, the AOJ increased the rating for the right lower extremity radiculopathy disability from 20 to 40 percent, effective February 10, 2021. 

The Veteran chose to participate in VA's test program "RAMP", the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program.  This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.  The Veteran opted into RAMP on December 12, 2023, and selected the Direct Review Lane.  As explained on the RAMP Opt-In Election Form, the review is based on evidence submitted to VA as of the date of the election, and the Veteran may not submit additional evidence. Thereafter, in subsequent correspondence, the Board accepted the Veteran's appeal and placed it on the Direct Review docket.  Under Direct Review, the Board will consider all evidence of record up to December 12, 2023.  The Board has not considered any evidence received or submitted after the December 2023 RAMP Opt-In Election. 

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

Increased Rating - Legal Criteria

Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4 (2021).  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (a), 4.1 (2021).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7 (2021).

In accordance with 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2 (2021) and Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991), the Board has reviewed all evidence of record pertaining to the history of the service-connected disabilities at issue.  The Board has found nothing in the historical record which would lead to the conclusion that the current evidence of record is not adequate for rating purposes.  Moreover, the Board is of the opinion that this case presents no evidentiary considerations which would warrant an exposition of remote clinical histories and findings pertaining to the disability.

In both initial rating claims and subsequent increased rating claims, the Board must discuss whether "staged ratings" are warranted, and if not, why not.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

In determining the degree of limitation of motion, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.10, 4.40, and 4.45 are for consideration.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995). 

The basis of disability evaluation is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10 (2021). 

It is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified; findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom are sufficient; and above all, a coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21 (2021).

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance. Functional loss may be due to the absence or deformity of structures or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior in undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.40.  In Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011), the Court held that, although pain may cause functional loss, "pain itself does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by VA regulations applicable to the musculoskeletal system."  Rather pain, may result in functional loss, but only if it limits the ability "to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, or endurance."  Id., quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40. 

With respect to joints, in particular, the factors of disability reside in reductions of normal excursion of movements in different planes.  Inquiry will be directed to more or less than normal movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, deformity or atrophy of disuse.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 (2021).

The intent of the Rating Schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability.  Thus, actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, are entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  The joints should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59 (2021).  In Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011), the Court found that, when 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record, even in non-arthritis context, the Board should address its applicability.

6.  Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy since February 10, 2021, on an extraschedular basis.

The Veteran contends that his left lower extremity radiculopathy disability is more severe than his current 20 percent evaluation for the rating period prior to November 21, 2014, and his 40 percent evaluation since November 21, 2014.  He also contends that his right lower extremity radiculopathy disability is more severe than his current 20 percent evaluation for the rating period prior to February 10, 2021, and his 40 percent evaluation since February 10, 2021.  Finally, he contends that he is entitlement to extraschedular ratings for his left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.  He is currently in receipt of the aforementioned ratings for his left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8520, which addresses impairment of the sciatic nerve.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. 

Diagnostic Code 8520 contemplates impairment of the sciatic nerve.  Incomplete mild paralysis of the sciatic nerve warrants a 10 percent rating.  A 20 percent rating requires moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  A 40 percent rating requires moderately severe paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  A 60 percent rating requires severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, with marked muscular atrophy.  An 80 percent rating requires complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, which is characterized by foot dangle and drop, no active movement possible of muscle below the knee, and flexion of the knee is weakened or (very rarely) lost.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" with peripheral nerve injuries indicates a degree of loss or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to the varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  See Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124 (a).

To clarify the meaning of the undefined subjective terms in the rating criteria as applied in this case, the Board acknowledges that VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (known as the M21-1) provides benchmarks for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe peripheral nerve conditions.  Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 17-18 (2021) (discussing that although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, the standards provided in the M21-1 are relevant guidance promulgated for the purpose of facilitating the efficient and proper resolution of claims, which the Board must consider and address as part of its duty to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision).  

The relevant section of the M21-1 describes mild incomplete paralysis as a disability "limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a smaller area."  A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.  Moderate incomplete paralysis, should be "reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment," where the sensory involvement covers "a larger area in the nerve distribution."  M21-1 examples of a moderate disability include "combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree" or "motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate."  The M21-1 provides that a moderately severe evaluation is available when there is "[m]otor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability."  Atrophy may, but need not, be present for a moderately severe rating.  To reach a severe degree of incomplete paralysis, motor and/or reflex impairment will be expected to reflect a very high level of limitation or disability.  Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases, and marked muscular atrophy is expected for the sciatic nerve.   See M21-1, Part V, sbpt. iii, ch. 12, sec. A.2.c.  

The Board notes that the M21-1 is not binding upon the Board.  The Board, in its consideration of appeals, "is bound by applicable statutes, regulations of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and precedent opinions of the General Counsel of the Department of Veterans Affairs, but not by Department manuals, circulars, or similar administrative issues." 38 C.F.R. § 19.5 (2021); see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (c) (2012).  However, this does not prevent the manual, and the measurements contained therein, from serving as a benchmark when evaluating the degree of severity of peripheral nerve conditions. 

A June 2004 Social Security Administration (SSA) record notes the Veteran's report of pain and numbness shooting down his right leg with loss of strength and endurance.  Examination revealed motor and sensory disturbances involving the right and left lower extremities with numbness and tingling, with the right worse than the left.  There was evidence of pain in the sitting and supine position.

A February 2006 private treatment record shows that range of motion is limited in all planes.  Straight leg test was positive at 45 degrees, bilaterally. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2006.  At the time he reported daily constant radiating and throbbing pain on a 7/10 level and numbness down his legs and into his feet.  The Veteran is prescribed Tramadol and Robaxin for his pain. 

Examination revealed negative foot drop, bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes were (1+) in the bilateral lower extremities.  Muscle strength was (3/5) in the bilateral lower extremities.  Straight leg raising test was positive at 20 degrees, bilaterally.  The Veteran could not walk on his heels or toes.  

A November 2009 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's report of pain radiating to both legs for the past 10 years.  He reported the pain increases when by exercise, movement, touching, manipulation, standing, and walking.  

A February 2010 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's ongoing radicular symptoms in his bilateral lower extremities, the right worse than the left.  He reported bilateral numbness and tingling, as well as some weakness in his legs since 2000.  He reported that the weakness in his right leg has led to falls that occurred around June 2009. 

A March 2010 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's report of decreased muscle strength in his lower extremities bilaterally, and heaviness in his left leg with ongoing bilateral leg pain.  Examination revealed decreased muscle strength of (4/5), bilaterally.  

A May 2010 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's report of weakness in his left leg, but the right leg is worse overall. 

A June 2010 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's report of numbness and tingling in his calves.  He reported some weakness in his legs, the right worse than the left.  He indicated that he utilizes a cane to prevent falling.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2010.  At the time, he reported constant daily bilateral radicular pain in his legs and feet.  He indicated that he utilizes a cane to prevent falling.  He stated that he could not walk more than a half of a block without increased pain.  The Veteran reported a lack of endurance due to his bilateral leg pain. 

Examination revealed that the Veteran could not stand on his heels and toes to walk.  There was evidence of weak extensor hallucis longus muscle strength.  Reflexes were absent (zero) in his knees or ankles.  Positive leg raise test with pain at 30 degrees, bilaterally.  There was no loss of pinprick to the thighs, legs, or feet.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's bilateral radicular pain has progressed along with his lumbar pain. 

A November 2010 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's report of bilateral leg pain, numbness, and tingling.  He reported weakness in his left leg, but indicated that his right leg is worse, explaining that the cold weather affected his pain level.  The Veteran reported that he utilized a cane to prevent falling. 

A January 2011 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's report of stinging pain down his legs and into his feet on a level of 7/10.  He stated that his pain was constant and acute with exacerbations. 

A December 2012 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's report of sharp, shooting, and throbbing pain down his legs. 

The Veteran underwent a VA peripheral nerve examination in May 2015.  At the time, the Veteran reported a progressive worsening of chronic lower extremity pain, paresthesia, and weakness.  He indicated that he could only walk 25 feet before having to rest due to bilateral lower extremity pain and weakness.  The Veteran reported that he requires daily use of a cane for ambulation. 

Examination revealed moderate constant pain, intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness of the bilateral lower extremities.  Muscle strength testing of the bilateral knee extension, bilateral ankle plantar flexion, and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion was active movement against gravity, which was (3/5).  There was no evidence of muscle atrophy.  Reflex exam (deep tendon reflexes) demonstrated absent right knee at zero, left knee, right ankle, and left ankle were hypoactive (1+).  Sensory exam of the upper anterior thigh (L2), thigh/knee (L3/4), and lower leg/ankle (L4/L5/S1) was normal bilaterally.  Sensory exam of the foot/toes (L5) was decreased, bilaterally.  There was evidence of trophic changes of his bilateral lower extremities, with smooth and shiny skin.  The Veteran's gait was abnormal and antalgic due to his bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy.  He used a cane for ambulation.  The examiner found that there was moderate incomplete paralysis of the right sciatic nerve, and moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the left sciatic nerve.  Regarding functional impact of the Veteran's bilateral peripheral nerve condition, he had very limited lower extremity range of motion, lack of balance, chronic weakness, and chronic moderate to severe pain.  The examiner diagnosed bilateral lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy.  

A March 2018 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's report of pain on a 7/10 level down his legs. 

The Veteran underwent a VA peripheral nerve examination in February 2021.  At the time, the Veteran reported constant daily pain in his legs. 

Examination revealed moderate constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness of the bilateral lower extremities.  There was no evidence of intermittent pain of the bilateral lower extremities.  Muscle strength testing of the bilateral knee extension, bilateral ankle plantar flexion, and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion was active movement against some resistance, which was (4/5).  There was no evidence of muscle atrophy.  Reflex exam (deep tendon reflexes) demonstrated bilateral knee and bilateral ankle were hypoactive (1+).  Sensation testing of the upper anterior thigh (L2), thigh/knee (L3/4), and lower leg/ankle (:4/L5/S1) was normal, bilaterally.  Sensation testing of foot/toes (L5) was decreased, bilaterally.  There was evidence of trophic changes bilaterally, to include smooth skin.  The Veteran's gait was abnormal due to his bilateral peripheral neuropathy.  The examiner noted that the Veteran required regular use of a cane.  The examiner found that there was moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the right and left sciatic nerve.  Regarding functional impact of the Veteran's bilateral peripheral nerve condition, he could only walk a half block with the use of an assistive device, he could not stand for more than 45 minutes, and he could not carry anything that weighs more than 20 pounds.  

The Veteran underwent a VA lumbar spine examination in April 2023.  At the time, the Veteran reported constant daily pain that radiates into his legs. 

Examination included muscle strength testing which demonstrates normal strength (5/5) bilaterally, for hip flexion, knee extension ankle plantar flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and great toe extension.  There was no evidence of muscle atrophy.  Reflex exam revealed a hypoactive right knee of (1+), and the right ankle, left knee, and left ankle were normal (2+).  Sensory exam demonstrated normal upper anterior thigh (L2) and thigh/knee (L3/4), bilaterally; decreased lower leg/ankle (L4/L5/S1), bilaterally; and decreased foot/toes (L5), bilaterally.  Straight leg raising test was positive, bilaterally.  There was evidence of moderate constant pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness of the bilateral lower extremities.  There was evidence of severe intermittent pain of the bilateral lower extremities.  The examiner noted involvement of sciatic nerve (L4/L5/S1/S2/S3), bilaterally. 

In an April 2023 opinion, a VA examiner was asked to opine with regard to the severity of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy for the period from November 17, 2005, to November 21, 2014.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran has had progressive radiculopathy in the lower extremities for the period from November 17, 2005, to November 21, 2014.  Earlier imaging demonstrates disc protrusion with nerve impingement.  A March 2009 MRI report shows degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, minimal kyphosis, numerous Schmorl's nodes defects, minimal to moderate osteophytes, minor compression of the anterior-superior margins of T12 and L1 vertebral bodies, degenerative disc disease at L2-L3 level.  A February 2010 MRI report demonstrates multilevel spondylosis, severe degenerative disc disease at L4/L5 and L5/S1.  In addition, the Veteran has complained of weakness in the lower extremities and progressive bilateral lower extremity radiating pain.  The examiner concluded that as per the February 2021 VA examination, it is clear that the Veteran has moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the bilateral sciatic nerve resulting in bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. 

In an October 2023 opinion, a VA examiner was asked to opine with regard to the severity of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy for the period from November 17, 2005, to November 21, 2014.  The examiner indicated that he is unable to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, as the severity of the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is subjective and not documented in the record. 

In a November 2023 opinion, a VA examiner was asked to opine with regard to the severity of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy for the period from November 17, 2005, to November 21, 2014.  The examiner indicated that the severity of the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy for the period in question should be considered moderate.  The examiner based his findings on the following: A November 2005 exam shows deep tendon reflexes present and normal in right and left lower extremities, and straight leg raising test was positive at 30 degrees, bilaterally.  The Veteran continued to report radiating pain from his lumbar spine into his lower extremities.  A February 2006 exam revealed no motor or sensory deficit in the lower extremities, and straight leg raising test was positive at 45 degrees, bilaterally.  A June 2006 exam revealed no apparent neurological deficit present in the lower extremities.  A November 2006 VA examination noted the Veteran's report of daily throbbing pain on a 7/10 level and numbness radiating down his legs.  Examination revealed negative foot drop, bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes were (1+) in the bilateral lower extremities.  Muscle strength in the lower extremities was (3/5).  Straight leg raising test was positive at 20 degrees, bilaterally.  The Veteran could not walk on his heels or toes.  A February 2010 record notes the Veteran's report of bilateral leg weakness and numbness and tingling to his calf, worse on the right leg.  He also indicated that he noticed some weakness in his legs since 2000, and the weakness in his right leg has led to falls that occurred around June 2009.  A March 2010 record notes the Veteran's report of decreased muscle strength in his lower extremities bilaterally, and heaviness in his left leg with ongoing bilateral leg pain.  An October 2010 VA examination report shows that the Veteran reported constant daily bilateral radicular pain in his legs and feet.  He indicated that he utilizes a cane to prevent falling.  He indicated that he could walk more than a half of a block without increased pain.  The Veteran reported a lack of endurance due to his bilateral leg pain.  Examination revealed that the Veteran could not stand on his heels and toes to walk.  He had weak extensor hallucis longus muscle strength.  There were no reflexes in his knees or ankles.  A November 2010 record notes the Veteran's report of bilateral leg pain, numbness, and tingling.  A January 2011 record notes the Veteran's report of stinging pain down his legs and into his feet on a level of 7/10 that was constant, with acute exacerbations.  A December 2012 VA record notes the Veteran's report of sharp, shooting, and throbbing pain down his legs. 

Left Lower Extremity Radiculopathy from November 17, 2005, to October 26, 2010  

Right Lower Extremity Radiculopathy November 17, 2005, to October 26, 2010  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's left and right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy disabilities prior to October 26, 2010.  In this regard, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's left and right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy symptoms and impairment to most closely approximate moderate radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve prior to October 26, 2010.  Specifically, SSA records dated in June 2004 and August 2004 note the Veteran's report of bilateral lower extremity pain and numbness.  A June 2005 SSA record indicates a positive straight leg raising test without evidence of muscle atrophy in the lower extremities.  A November 2005 private record reveals deep tendon reflexes that were normal in the lower extremities.  A November 2006 VA examination report demonstrates muscle strength of (3/5) and deep tendon reflexes of (1+) in the lower extremities.  There was no evidence of drop foot, bilaterally.  A November 2009 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's report of pain radiating to both legs for the past 10 years.  VA outpatient treatment records dated in February 2010 through June 2010 notes the Veteran's report of bilateral lower extremity pain, numbness, weakness, and decreased strength.  A March 2010 VA outpatient treatment record revealed lower extremity muscle strength was decreased on flexion with active movement against some resistance, which was (4/5) bilaterally. In a November 2023 opinion, a VA examiner reviewed the record and found that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy resulted in moderately severe incomplete paralysis during the period from November 17, 2005, to November 21, 2014.  In an April 2023 opinion, a VA examiner reviewed the record and found that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy resulted in moderate incomplete paralysis during the period from November 17, 2005, to November 21, 2014.

The Board acknowledges the November 2023 VA opinion, in which the examiner opined that the severity of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy for the period from November 17, 2005, to November 21, 2014, was moderately severe.  However, in providing the opinion, the examiner cited to the findings on the February 2021 VA examination, noting that it is clear that the Veteran has moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the bilateral sciatic nerve resulting in bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  In this regard, the February 2021 VA examination is not relevant to this stage of the rating period, as the Board is evaluating the period on appeal prior to October 26, 2010.  

Accordingly, an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's left and right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy disabilities, respectively, is not warranted for the period prior to October 26, 2010.  While the Veteran's disabilities were manifested by significant sensory impairment, where the sensory involved a larger area in the nerve distribution, to include motor and reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes, the Board finds that the next higher 40 percent evaluation is not warranted, as the Veteran's left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities are not moderately severe, as motor and reflex impairment did not result in a high level of limitation, and there was no evidence of muscle atrophy.

Left Lower Extremity Radiculopathy from October 26, 2010  

Right Lower Extremity Radiculopathy from October 26, 2010  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a rating of 40 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's left and right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy disabilities prior to November 21, 2014, and February 10, 2021, respectively.  In this regard, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's left and right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy symptoms and impairment to most closely approximate moderately severe radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve as of October 26, 2010.  Specifically, on VA examination in October 2010, the Veteran reported constant daily bilateral radicular pain in his legs and feet.  He utilized a cane to prevent falling.  He could not walk more than a half of a block without increased pain and experienced a lack of endurance due to his bilateral leg pain.  On examination, reflexes were absent in his right and left knees and ankles.  He had weak extensor hallucis longus muscle strength.  Straight leg raising test was positive pain at 30 degrees, bilaterally.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's bilateral radicular pain has progressed along with his lumbar pain.  A November 2010 VA outpatient treatment record notes the Veteran's report of bilateral leg pain, numbness, and tingling, as well as weakness in his left leg.  The Veteran reported that he utilized a cane to prevent falling.  A May 2015 VA examination report notes the Veteran's report of a progressive worsening of chronic lower extremity pain, paresthesia, and weakness.  He indicated that he could only walk 25 feet before having to rest due to bilateral lower extremity pain and weakness.  Examination revealed moderate constant pain, intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness of the bilateral lower extremities.  Muscle strength testing of the bilateral knee extension, bilateral ankle plantar flexion, and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion was active movement against gravity, which was (3/5).  There was no evidence of muscle atrophy.  Reflex exam (deep tendon reflexes) of the right knee was absent at zero, and the left knee, right ankle, and left ankle were hypoactive at (1+).  Sensory exam of the foot /toes (L5) was decreased, bilaterally.  There was evidence of trophic changes of his bilateral lower extremities, with smooth and shiny skin.  The Veteran's gait was abnormal and antalgic.  He used a cane for ambulation.  There was moderate incomplete paralysis of the right sciatic nerve.  There was moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the left sciatic nerve.  A February 2021 VA examination report revealed moderate constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness of the bilateral lower extremities.  Muscle strength testing of the bilateral knee extension, bilateral ankle plantar flexion, and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion was active movement against some resistance, which resulted in (4/5).  There was no evidence of muscle atrophy.  Reflex exam (deep tendon reflexes) demonstrated bilateral knee and bilateral ankle hypoactivity of (1+).  Sensation testing of foot/toes (L5) was decreased, bilaterally.  There was evidence of trophic changes bilaterally, to include smooth skin.  There was moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the right and left sciatic nerve.  The examiner noted that the Veteran required regular use of a cane.  The April 2023 VA examination report demonstrates normal strength (5/5) bilaterally, for hip flexion, knee extension ankle plantar flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and great toe extension.  There was no evidence of muscle atrophy.  Reflex exam revealed the right knee was hypoactive (1+), and the left knee, right ankle, and left ankle were normal (2+).  Sensory exam demonstrated normal upper anterior thigh (L2) and thigh/knee (L3/4), bilaterally; decreased lower leg/ankle (L4/L5/S1), bilaterally; and decreased foot/toes (L5), bilaterally.  Straight leg raising test was positive, bilaterally.  There was evidence of moderate constant pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness of the bilateral lower extremities.  There was evidence of severe intermittent pain of the bilateral lower extremities.  The examiner noted involvement of sciatic nerve (L4/L5/S1/S2/S3), bilaterally.  In a November 2023 opinion, a VA examiner reviewed the record and found that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy resulted in moderately severe incomplete paralysis during the period from November 17, 2005, to November 21, 2014.  In an April 2023 opinion, a VA examiner reviewed the record and found that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy resulted in moderate incomplete paralysis during the period from November 17, 2005, to November 21, 2014.

The Board acknowledges the May 2015 VA examination, in which the examiner found that there was moderate incomplete paralysis of the right sciatic nerve; however, the examination demonstrates deep tendon reflexes of the right knee were absent at zero, muscle strength testing of the right knee and ankle was active movement against gravity, which was (3/5), and sensory exam of the right foot toes (L5) was decreased.  Further, the aforementioned VA and private treatment records and examinations during the rating period demonstrate moderately severe right lower extremity radiculopathy, as demonstrated by the aforementioned reflex and sensory examinations, and the Veteran's consistent report of moderately severe constant pain, numbness, and decreased strength of his right lower extremity. 

The Board also acknowledges the May 2015 and February 2021 VA examination reports, which note trophic changes of the Veteran's left and right lower extremities, as there was smooth and shiny skin, as well as the April 2023 VA examination, which notes the examiner's finding of severe intermittent pain of the bilateral lower extremities.  However, overall, the aforementioned VA and private treatment records and examinations demonstrate no more than moderately severe left and right lower extremity radiculopathy since October 26, 2010, as there is no evidence of any muscle atrophy during the rating period on appeal, and marked muscular atrophy is expected in the sciatic nerve for severe cases. 

Finally, the Board acknowledges the April 2023 VA opinion, in which a VA examiner reviewed the record and found that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy resulted in moderate incomplete paralysis during the period from November 17, 2005, to November 21, 2014.  In this regard, the Board finds that the evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities resulted in moderately severe incomplete paralysis as of the October 26, 2010, VA examination, which demonstrates motor and reflex impairment, to include weak extensor hallucis longus muscle strength, and reflexes that were absent in his knees and ankles, bilaterally.  In addition, the subsequent VA and private treatment records and VA examinations continue to show moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve of the bilateral lower extremities, as they document motor and reflex impairment, to include weakness or diminished reflexes, reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability than moderate incomplete paralysis.   

Accordingly, an evaluation of 40 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's left and right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy disabilities, respectively, is warranted for the period since October 26, 2010, as the Veteran's disabilities demonstrate motor or reflex impairment to include weakness or diminished reflexes at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability than a moderate rating.  The Board finds that the next 60 percent evaluation is not warranted, as the Veteran's left and right lower extremity impairment did not result in a severe degree of incomplete paralysis, as motor and reflex impairment did not result in a very high level of limitation or disability; specifically, there was no evidence of muscle atrophy. 

Further, the Board has considered the lay evidence offered by the Veteran in the form of correspondence, in addition to the medical evidence cited above.  In this regard, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's consistent report of left and right lower extremity pain and numbness.  However, even affording the lay statements full competence and credibility, the evidence simply does not show entitlement to a higher rating under any applicable Code.

Accordingly, a rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for the left lower extremity radiculopathy disability prior to October 26, 2010; a rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for the right lower extremity radiculopathy disability prior to October 26, 2010; a rating of 40 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the left lower extremity radiculopathy disability since October 26, 2010; and a rating of 40 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the right lower extremity radiculopathy disability since October 26, 2010, to include as a "staged" rating(s) pursuant to Fenderson and Hart.

Extraschedular Consideration

The Veteran and his representative raised the issue of entitlement to an extraschedular evaluation for his service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.  Ratings shall be based as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity with the additional proviso that the Secretary shall from time to time readjust this schedule of ratings in accordance with experience.  To accord justice, therefore, to the exceptional case where the schedular evaluations are found to be inadequate, the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director, Compensation and Pension Service, upon field station submission, is authorized to approve on the basis of the criteria set forth in this paragraph an extra-schedular evaluation commensurate with the average earning capacity impairment due exclusively to the service- connected disability or disabilities.  The governing norm in these exceptional cases is:  A finding that the case presents such an exceptional or unusual disability picture with such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization as to render impractical the application of the regular schedular standards. 

In Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008), the Court specified the analytical steps necessary to determine whether referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted.  The Court stated that the RO or the Board must first determine whether the schedular rating criteria reasonably describe the Veteran's disability level and symptomatology.  Id. at 115.  If the schedular rating criteria do reasonably describe the Veteran's disability level and symptomatology, the assigned schedular evaluation is adequate, referral for extraschedular consideration is not required, and the analysis stops.  Id.; see also Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017).

If the RO or the Board finds that the schedular evaluation does not contemplate the Veteran's level of disability and symptomatology, then either the RO or the Board must determine whether the Veteran's exceptional disability picture includes other related factors such as marked interference with employment and frequent periods of hospitalization.  See Thun, 22 Vet. App. at 116.  If this is the case, then the RO or the Board must refer the matter to the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service for the third step of the analysis, determining whether justice requires assignment of an extraschedular rating.  The Board is precluded by regulation from assigning an extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321 (b)(1) in the first instance.  However, the Board is not precluded from raising this question and addressing referral where circumstances are presented which the Director of VA's Compensation and Pension Service might consider exceptional or unusual.  Shipwash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 218, 227 (1995). 

The Board has considered the evidence of record and the Veteran's lay assertions. In its April 2020 decision, the Board referred the issues to the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service for extraschedular consideration in this case. 

In a February 2021 opinion, the Director of Compensation Service recommended against an extraschedular rating for the Veteran's left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.  

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that a higher rating on an extraschedular basis is not warranted at any point during the period on appeal for the Veteran's left or right lower extremity radiculopathy.  The evidence does not demonstrate severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, with marked muscular atrophy, or complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, which is characterized by foot dangle and drop, no active movement possible of muscle below the knee, and flexion of the knee is weakened.

The Board has also considered the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, and the holdings in DeLuca.  However, higher ratings for the Veteran's left or right lower extremity radiculopathy disorders are not warranted on the basis of functional loss due to pain or weakness in this case, as the Veteran's symptoms are supported by pathology consistent with the assigned 40 percent ratings, respectively, and no higher.  In this regard, the Board observes that the Veteran complained of pain, throughout the period, however, the effect of the pain in the Veteran's left and right lower extremities is contemplated in the currently assigned disability ratings. The Veteran's complaints do not, when viewed in conjunction with the medical evidence, tend to establish weakened movement, excess fatigability, or incoordination to the degree that would warrant an increased evaluation.  The Court has held that pain alone does not constitute functional loss under VA regulations that evaluate disabilities based upon loss of motion.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disorders do not warrant disability ratings in excess of 40 percent since October 26, 2010.

The Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an extraschedular rating based on his service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disorder.  In this case, the manifestations of the service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disorder, as discussed above, are contemplated by the schedular criteria.  The Veteran's symptoms included pain, numbness, limited motion, less movement than normal, weakened movement, pain on movement, instability on station, trophic skin changes, standing and/or weight-bearing, and use of a cane.  The Veteran also reported difficulty sleeping and a decreased appetite due to pain.  The question is not whether the Veteran's particular symptoms are explicitly listed in the diagnostic code but whether the symptoms and level of his disability are adequately contemplated by the schedular rating system.  See Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 115 (2008).  While such symptoms are not specifically addressed under the rating criteria, such symptoms were taken into account in assigning the 40 percent disability ratings, respectively.  When comparing this disability picture with the symptoms contemplated by the Schedule, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms are more than adequately contemplated by his current disability ratings.  There is no credible evidence that the Veteran's service-connected disorder causes impairment that is not contemplated by the schedular rating criteria or that renders impractical the application of the regular schedular standards.  See Thun, 22 Vet. App. at 115.  As such, his left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disorder does not satisfy the first criteria for the assignment of an extraschedular rating, as the evidence does not demonstrate that his disability has produced an exceptional or unusual disability picture.

Furthermore, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disorder caused marked interference with employment beyond that contemplated by the assigned rating or the assigned TDIU.  The evidence also does not show frequent hospitalization due to the Veteran's left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disorder.  Accordingly, an extraschedular rating for the Veteran's service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disorder is not warranted.

In reaching the above conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the current appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b).

Earlier Effective Date - Legal Criteria

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

The effective date of an award of increased disability compensation, to include TDIU, shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date, otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of claim, 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).  If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1), (2). If the increase occurred after the date of the claim, the effective date is the date of increase.  Id.  

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) determined that a TDIU award is an award of increased disability compensation for purposes of assigning an effective date.  Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000); Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 420-21 (1999).  

The question in determining the effective date for TDIU is when it was factually ascertainable that the service-connected disabilities rendered a veteran unemployable.  Therefore, the three possible dates would be, depending on the facts of the case: (1) If a veteran becomes unemployable after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose).  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1); or (2) if a veteran's service-connected disabilities rendering him unemployable precede the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable).  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); or (3) if a veteran's service-connected disabilities rendering him unemployable precede the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim). 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997). 

A claimant may indicate their desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b).  If VA receives a complete application for benefits on the form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (a), appropriate to the benefit sought, within one year of receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  Id.; see also Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4 th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021), (invalidating § 3.155 in part to the extent it excludes AMA supplemental claims from the intent to file framework).

7.  Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 21, 2014, for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU. 

See argument Below at 8

8.  Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 21, 2014, for the grant of basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status. 

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date prior to November 21, 2104, is warranted for the award of TDIU.  Moreover, he also contends that he has been unable to work due to his service-connected disabilities since 1993.  See Veteran's VA Form 21-8940 dated in November 2014. 

The Board agrees and grants an earlier effective date for entitlement to a TDIU as of October 26, 2010.  In making this finding, there is competent evidence that the Veteran has been unable to sustain and maintain work since at least October 26, 2010, and the grants of increased ratings for the service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities (herein) supports that the Veteran meets the minimum requirements of entitlement to a TDIU since October 26, 2010.  See 4.16 (a).  Furthermore, as the claim for basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status is directly related to the Veteran's claim of entitlement to TDIU, and entitlement to TDIU has been established as of October 26, 2010, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status is also warranted, effective October 26, 2010.
