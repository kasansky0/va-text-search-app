ORDER

Entitlement to a rating of 100 percent for PTSD, major depressive disorder, with opioid use and alcohol use (PTSD) is granted, effective August 14, 2022.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), due to the Veteran's service-connected PTSD disability, is denied.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) is not warranted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least in approximate balance that during the appeal period, the Veteran demonstrates grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting others; and an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living including an inability to maintain his hygiene.

2. TDIU is not warranted as the Veteran's PTSD is rated at 100 percent.

3. The Veteran does not have disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from his PTSD; and he is not permanently housebound.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an increased rating of 100 percent for PTSD, effective August 14, 2022, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§3.1, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400, 3.2500(c), 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.14, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411, 19.52, 20.1103.

2. The criteria for entitlement to TDIU are not met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 4.16, 4.29.

3. The criteria for SMC are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. § 3.350.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army from July 2007 to July 2008 with additional Army Reserve service.

The decision on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from the regional office (referred to as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ)), was issued in December 2023. Therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

By way of procedural history, the Veteran filed an intent to file a claim in May 2017, but did not file a claim within one year, thus, it had no effect. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(4)(6).

The Veteran then filed another intent to file a claim in October 2018; followed by VA Form 21-526EZ (Claim) in January 2019 for service connection of his claimed PTSD disability. And the AOJ denied it in June 2019. The June 2019 decision became final as the Veteran did not appeal the decision, nor select another available review option, within one year. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

The Veteran filed another intent to file claim in October 2019 (within a year of the October 2018 intent to file), followed by VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim) in February 2021. The AOJ granted service connection for the Veteran's PTSD in October 2021, evaluating the Veteran's disability as 70 percent disabling, effective February 24, 2021. 

The Veteran then filed VA Form 21-526EZ (Claim) in November 2021, requesting a higher rating for his PTSD based on a temporary total evaluation for his disability due to hospital treatment in excess of 21 days under 38 C.F.R. § 4.29. And the AOJ denied the claim in January 2022, citing the November 2021 claim. 

The AOJ then issued another decision, citing a February 2021 supplemental claim, denying the Veteran's inferred TDIU claim in March 2022. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009) (holding that a request for a TDIU, whether expressly raised by a Veteran or reasonably raised by the record, is not a separate "claim" for benefits, but rather, can be part of a claim for increased compensation); see also Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding that a separate, formal claim is not required in cases where an informal claim for a TDIU has been reasonably raised). Both the January and March 2022 decisions became final as the Veteran did not appeal either decision, nor select another available review option, within one year. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

The Board notes the Veteran filed an intent to file in December 2021. However, the December 2021 intent to file was received after the November 2021 claim; and it was followed by another intent to file in July 2022 (within the same year), and no claim was filed within one year of the December 2021 intent to file. Thus, the December 2021 and July 2022 intent to file have no effect. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6).

In March 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-0966 (Intent to File a Claim). In June 2023, the Veteran then filed VA Form 21-526EZ (Claim) requesting a higher rating for his PTSD based on a temporary total evaluation for his disability due to hospital treatment in excess of 21 days under 38 C.F.R. § 4.29. The AOJ denied the claim in June 2023. The Board notes the March 2023 intent to file preserved the Veteran's effective date of claim stemming from the June 2023 decision. However, the June 2023 decision became final as the Veteran did not appeal it, nor select another available review option, within one year. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

In August 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ (Claim) citing "financial problems."  The Veteran also filed VA Form 21-8940 (TDIU Express Claim) and another VA Form 21-526EZ (Claim) requesting a temporary higher rating for his PTSD due to inpatient treatment for substance abuse and TDIU. See August 14, 2023 Claim; August 24, 2023 TDIU Express Claim; August 24, 2023 Claim. 

In December 2023, the AOJ issued a decision (citing the August 14, 2023, claim), but adjudicating the Veteran's increased rating for PTSD and TDIU claims. The August 2023 claim constitutes a new non-initial claim for an increased rating as it was not continuously pursued. C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.160, 3.2500(c); Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

The Veteran then filed VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) in June 2024, citing the December 2023 decision and noting his disagreement with the AOJ's evaluation of his PTSD and his ability to find and maintain employment (entitlement to TDIU). The Veteran selected direct review of his claim; thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes the Veteran filed an intent to file a claim in June 2024, followed by VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim) in November 2024. In his supplemental claim, the Veteran cites his PTSD rating, the effective date of his rating, and his entitlement to TDIU. In February 2025, the AOJ sent the Veteran a letter noting "review of your file revealed that we are already processing a pending appeal for TDIU and mental health condition, which we received on June 25, 2024.  We have forwarded this new evidence to the appropriate processing team for consideration. Since the issue(s) you are claiming are already on an appeal, we cannot accept your claim for that issue at this time." See January 2025 Appeal Notification Letter. 

The Board also notes the Veteran filed three intent to file a claim forms in August 2024, September 2024, and November 2024, but to-date, no new claim has been received. 

Additionally, the Board notes that in January 2025, the Veteran's Representative, Rob Levine & Associates, requested to withdraw a Board hearing. See January 2025 Letter. However, the Veteran selected direct review of his claim in the June 2024 Notice of Disagreement and the request was untimely. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2)(noting requests to modify a Notice of Disagreement must be made by completing a new Notice of Disagreement on a form prescribed by the Secretary, and must be received at the Board within one year from the date that the AOJ mails the notice of the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement, whichever is later.) Here, the time expired on December 6, 2024-one year after the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal. 

Increased Rating

The Veteran contends his PTSD, major depressive disorder, with opioid use and alcohol use (PTSD) is worsening; and that his PTSD is the reason for his substance abuse and addiction. See August 2023 Claim; August 2023 Treatment Records. 

The Veteran has completed several inpatient treatment programs for his substance abuse, but he believes he left the programs too early and relapsed. He believes that he needs a more structured and stable environment to address his recovery challenges: He was discharged from a program in February 2023 to independent housing but relapsed shortly thereafter; and he entered an inpatient treatment program in May 2023, but left early (June 2023) due to his father's death, and relapsed again. See February 2023, May 2023, June 2023, August 2023 VA Treatment Records; June 2023 Hospital Review; December 2023 VA Examination.

Additionally, the Veteran lost his driver's license and custody of his children as a result of substance abuse and domestic violence; and he no longer has supervised visits with his son. He has been arrested several times based on his substance abuse. He also reports that he has a case in Veteran's Court requiring him to participate in substance abuse and behavioral health interventions, and he reports his recovery is his main priority. See March 2023, May 2023, June 2023, August 2023 VA Treatment Records; December 2023 VA Examination.

The Veteran states he finds it difficult to interact with people he does not know but reports having one friend with whom he spends time with. He reports he has been focused on his recovery for the last six or seven years, but he feels hopeless because he does not know how to manage everything on his plate. He feels worthless; and he reports difficulty focusing, remembering, and difficulty with reading comprehension. He states that he has decreased aggression towards others because he is "trying to deal with himself" and he has been "living like a hermit" so that he can stay out of trouble. He has severe anxiety, nightmares, and he is at risk of losing his housing. He has panic attacks daily, and he reports a past suicide attempt in 2018. See May 2023, June 2023, August 2023, September 2023 VA Treatment Records; May 2023 Lay Statement; December 2023 VA Examination.

He believes that people are always watching him and that they are always against him. He states his medications have been changed so many times that it is difficult to keep up. And although he has learned a lot about mental health tools, he does not know how to use them. Finally, he entered another inpatient treatment program in June 2023, and he hopes to transition into a PTSD program following discharge in October 2023. See August 2023 VA Treatment Records; August 2023 Lay Statement; December 2023 VA Examination. 

Relevant Legal Principals 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R.§ 4.1. When rating a service-connected disability, the entire medical history must be considered. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Where there is a question as to which of two ratings should be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided; however, separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one disability is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994); 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 70 percent disability rating is assigned for a psychiatric disorder manifested by occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

A 100 percent disability rating requires total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

The symptoms listed in DC 9411are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002); see also Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 117 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (explaining that the symptoms that could give rise to a given rating are those in like kind, i.e., of similar duration, severity, and frequency, to those provided in the non-exhaustive lists).

Further, "VA is not required to find the presence of all, most, or even some of the enumerated symptoms to assign a particular evaluation . . . ." The Veteran's impairment must be "due to" these symptoms and the evidence must demonstrate the symptoms "have caused the level of occupational and social impairment associated with a particular disability evaluation." Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 18-20 (U.S. 2017) (noting that suicidal ideation-both passive and active-alone may warrant a 70 percent rating.) And favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all subsequent AOJ and Board adjudicators, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

Additionally, lay statements made by a Veteran can be competent and credible when they relate to evidence derived from the witnesses own personal knowledge and limited to what the witness has observed through the senses. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

VA regulations provide that unless otherwise specified, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an increased rating claim is to be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Here, the appeal period begins August 14, 2023, which is the date the Veteran submitted his claim for an increased rating. Per 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) and Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (2010), there is a one-year lookback period for non-initial claims for an increased rating, such as in this case. Therefore, the Board must consider whether an increase in disability occurred at any time from August 14, 2022. C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.160, 3.400(o)(2), 3.2500(c); Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (2010).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2)(A), an effective date for an increased rating "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date that is one year before the date of receipt of the application." Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), the earliest effective date for an increased rating is the earliest date that an increase in disability can be factually ascertained based on all the evidence of record so long as the Veteran has filed a complete claim or filed an intent to file a claim which is received within one year of that date.

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must also analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990). Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) ("although interest may affect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect competency to testify").

Finally, the Board must determine whether the evidence supports the Veteran's claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). The Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate balance" (meaning nearly equal) between evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. 

Facts and Analysis

As noted above, the review period begins August 14, 2023, and the evidence window closed on December 4, 2023. C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.160, 3.400(o)(2), 3.2500(c); Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (2010).

The evidence on review includes a VA examination from December 2023 and VA treatment records from January 2023 to September 2023.

Beginning first with the December 2023 VA examination, the examiner finds the Veteran's occupational and social impairment as "occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood," which equates to a 70 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411. 

In reaching this conclusion, the examiner notes the Veteran's symptoms include: depressed mood; anxiety; panic attacks more than once a week; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting. However, as noted above, the Veteran states that he manages his aggression by "living like a hermit" so that he can stay out of trouble and keep from harming others. See December 2023 VA Examination.

Turning to the Veteran's VA treatment records, although the Veteran is noted as being at "low risk" for suicidal and homicidal ideation, his treatment providers note the Veteran is "in a safe environment [at the inpatient substance abuse treatment facility, with] no access to lethal means [to cause anyone harm.] See September 2023 VA Treatment Records. And his treatment records demonstrate he lost his driver's license, he was arrested several times, he lost custody of his children based on an act of domestic violence, he lost supervised visits with at least one of his children, and he is involved in several different court cases due to his PTSD symptoms and substance abuse issues. All of which indicate the Veteran demonstrates grossly inappropriate behavior. See March 2023, May 2023, June 2023, August 2023 VA Treatment Records; December 2023 VA Examination. 

Additionally, living like a "hermit" to keep from harming others and being in a secure facility without the means to harm someone else does not indicate the Veteran is not in persistent danger of hurting others. Rather, the fact the Veteran has pending charges based on domestic violence (harming someone else) demonstrates the opposite. As such, the record demonstrates the Veteran is in persistent danger of hurting others due to his disability even if the constraints of his treatment (living alone and being in a secure facility) render it impossible to act on these impulses.

Moreover, in September 2023, while the Veteran was seeking inpatient substance abuse treatment, a treatment provider notes the Veteran's appearance as disheveled and malodorous (smelling unpleasant). See September 2023 VA Treatment Records. These facts indicate the Veteran has an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living including an inability to maintain his hygiene. 

Although the Veteran exhibits symptoms indicative of a 70 percent rating for his PTSD (difficulty interacting with others, having few friends, depression, memory issues, daily panic attacks, and severe anxiety); he also exhibits symptoms of a 100 percent rating (grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting others, and an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living including an inability to maintain his hygiene.) See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411; March 2023, May 2023, June 2023, August 2023, September 2023 VA Treatment Records; May 2023 Lay Statement; December 2023 VA Examination.

As such, the Board finds the December 2023 VA examination to be less persuasive than the Veteran's treatment records. Because the December 2023 examiner does not consider the Veteran's lay statements, or the evidence as outlined above, in finding the Veteran's occupational and social functioning are indicative of a 70 percent rating rather than a 100 percent rating, the Board awards it little weight. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contentions that his symptoms have worsened and find him to be competent and credible as his treatment records correlate with his lay statements throughout the appeal period. Additionally, he is competent to report his symptoms and how he feels; but he is not competent to evaluate his symptoms and assign a rating based on the same as that requires special medical and/or legal education and familiarity of VA procedure. See February 2023, March 2023, May 2023, June 2023, August 2023, September 2023 VA Treatment Records; May 2023 Lay Statement; December 2023 VA Examination; Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991)

The Board finds the evidence of record is in approximate balance between a 70 percent and a 100 percent rating. Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds the evidence warrants an increased rating of 100 percent, effective the date of claim, August 14, 2022. Accordingly, the claim is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.160, 3.400(o)(2), 3.2500(c), 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, DC 9400-9432; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (2010).

TDIU and SMC

The Veteran contends he has been unable to find and maintain gainful employment because of his PTSD symptoms and that these symptoms require him to be in an inpatient treatment program. He worked as a railroad conductor from 2013 to 2019, but he lost his job due to his PTSD and substance abuse issues. And he worked for a short time in a transitional work assignment at the VA, from October 2022 to December 2022, but he walked off the job due to his PTSD and substance abuse issues. He then worked at Amazon, from July 2022 to October 2022, but he applied for medical leave to seek inpatient treatment for his PTSD and substance abuse. See May 2023, June 2023 VA Treatment records; August 2023 Lay Statement; December 2023 VA Examination.

Relevant Legal Principals

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), a TDIU rating may be assigned in cases in which the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of their service-connected disabilities, provided that either the Veteran's single service-connected disability is ratable at 60 percent or more, or, if the Veteran has multiple service-connected disabilities, one of the disabilities is ratable at 40 percent or more and the others bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.

The term "unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains economic and noneconomic components. The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). A protected environment includes lower income positions that, due to the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market. See LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024). The noneconomic component requires consideration of a Veteran's ability to secure or follow that type of employment. In determining whether a Veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, attention is given to the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training; the Veteran's physical ability to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue; and the Veteran's mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).

In evaluating a Veteran's employability, consideration may be given to his level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his age or impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164, 168 (1991). The fact that a Veteran may be unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not determinative. The ultimate question is whether a Veteran, because of service-connected disability, is incapable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he can find employment. See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

However, the Court has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled. Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994), citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990). But a grant of a 100 percent disability does not always render the issue of TDIU moot. VA's duty to maximize a Veteran's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 243 (U.S. 2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). Specifically, special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is warranted when a Veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total and has an additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more. See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280 (analyzing 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)). 

"SMC is available when, 'as the result of service-connected disability,' a Veteran suffers additional hardships above and beyond those contemplated by VA's schedule for rating disabilities." Breniser v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 64, 68 (U.S. 2011) (citing 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114 (k)-(s)). Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), SMC is payable at the housebound rate if the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling and either of the following are met: (1) there is an additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or (2) he is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

Finally, Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.29, a total disability rating (100 percent) will be assigned without regard to other provisions of the rating schedule when it is established that a service-connected disability has required hospital treatment in a Department of Veterans Affairs or an approved hospital for a period in excess of 21 days or hospital observation at Department of Veterans Affairs expense for a service-connected disability for a period in excess of 21 days. However, this provision does not apply when the Veteran is currently receiving a total disability rating for the disability for which hospitalization was required. See M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, Chapter 8, Section B.1.c - When the Provisions of 38 CFR 4.29 Do Not Apply. 

Facts and Analysis

Here, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD disability meet the schedular criteria for entitlement to TDIU. See December 2023 Rating Decision. And favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all subsequent AOJ and Board adjudicators, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. However, entitlement to a TDIU is not warranted as the Veteran's PTSD is already rated at 100 percent. C.F.R. §§ 4.16, 4.29. 

Additionally, the Veteran is not entitled to SMC because he does not have other service-connected disabilities that are independently rated at 60 percent; and he is not permanently housebound as reflected in his treatment records. See August 2023 VA Treatment Records (noting the Veteran left inpatient treatment to attend his father's funeral); September 2023 VA Treatment Records (noting the Veteran participated in a recreational therapy hiking trip to Mossy Bank Park. The Veteran was able to walk various trails, play frisbee, and socialize with other Veterans while enjoying nature); December 2023 VA Examination (noting the Veteran worked at Amazon from July 2022 to October 2022, but applied for medical leave to seek inpatient treatment for his PTSD and substance abuse); January 2025 Code Sheet; 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). 

Accordingly, because the Veteran is rated 100 percent for his PTSD disability, and he was hospitalized for that same disability, the TDIU claim is denied. And SMC is not warranted because the Veteran does not have disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from his PTSD; and he is not permanently housebound. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104; 3.350(i), 4.16.
