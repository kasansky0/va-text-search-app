ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not currently have a pseudofolliculitis barbae disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active-duty service from November 1974 to November 1977.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's April 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the rating decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In adjudicating such claims, reasonable doubt that exists because of an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence concerning any point will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a pseudofolliculitis barbae disability. Specifically, he contends that he was diagnosed with pseudofolliculitis barbae while in service. See April 2022 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim (SSC).

By way of procedural history, VA received the Veteran's claim in his October 2021 VA Form 526EZ Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits. The claim was initially denied in a January 2022 rating decision. Thereafter, in response to a Supplemental Claim in April 2022, the AOJ denied the claim again in its October 2022 rating decision. During a February 2023 higher-level review (HLR) of the October 2022 rating decision, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error and directed correction and special review of the file. Following the correction and special review, the AOJ continued its denial in its October 2023 rating decision. 

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a timely Supplemental Claim, to which to AOJ denied in the April 2024 rating decision on appeal. Given that the AOJ has consistently found that new and relevant evidence was received to readjudicate the claim in its October 2022, October 2023 and April 2024 rating decisions, the Board accepts such finding as favorable to the Veteran and, therefore, not at issue here. As the Board accepts such finding that new and relevant was received, it shall proceed to adjudicate the claim on its merits. 

In his April 2022 SSC, the Veteran stated that Army regulation required soldiers to shave every day, and he had to shave every day because his "beard grew back fast". He stated that while he was on active duty he was diagnosed by service medical personnel with pseudofolliculitis barbae. In his December 2023 SSC, the Veteran further stated that he was given a "shaving profile" in service that allowed him to wear a light beard instead of the mandatory daily full face hair shaving. He also stated that he had a cyst behind his left ear that was surgically removed while in service. He claims that he now has scars covering about 25 to 50 percent of his face, no longer shaves and uses a topical cream.

Service treatment records do not reflect any "shaving profile", nor do they reflect a diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae or of any skin condition, other than a benign cyst behind his left ear, which the Veteran reported existed since birth. See April 1976 service treatment records. In April 1976, at the age of 20 years old, the benign cyst behind his left ear was surgically removed. Also, an in-service skin assessment examination documented "no rashes". See May 1976 service treatment records. 

VA treatment records are silent as to any diagnosis, complaints or treatment for the claimed pseudofolliculitis barbae condition. See December 2017 VA treatment records (wherein it documents "Skin: No rashes, purpura, or petechiae"); July 2014 VA treatment records (wherein a "current skin assessment" noted "no wounds, pressure ulcers or other skin problems"; and August 2013 VA treatment records (wherein it documents "No suspicious masses or lesions, erythema, draining wounds on skin of face, scalp, or neck").

To address the Veteran's claim, he was afforded two VA skin examinations, one in November 2021 and the other in May 2023. 

During the November 2021 examination, the Veteran reported that in 1975 he began to notice the bumps around bottom of face around beard line, sensitive and painful to touch. He reported that he currently has persistent bumps around the beard line that are sensitive/painful. He further reported that he does not undergo any treatment or use any creams. He reported that he had last shaved about one month prior to the examination. Although the examiner remarked that the Veteran "has no visible characteristics [of pseudofolliculitis barbae] after Veteran let the beard grow out", pursuant to the Veteran's assertions, she documented that the Veteran has pseudofolliculitis barbae that was diagnosed in 1975. The examiner observed that the Veteran did not have any scarring of the face. The examiner did not find the Veteran's claimed condition to be related to service and explained that "[w]hile it is true that pseudofolliculitis barbae likely incurred due to the requirement to shave, it is less likely than not to be caused by serving in the military as veteran may have developed these symptoms any time he shaved. Further, there are no complaints found in treatment records for this condition during activity duty. It is a common findings in up to 60% of African Americans and treatment is to let the beard grow out. On exam, there is no evidence of rash as veteran grew out the hair after shaving it one month ago".

At the May 2023 VA examination, the examiner did not find the Veteran to have any current skin disability.  The examiner documented the Veteran's history of pseudofolliculitis barbae that began in 1974, as the Veteran had reported. However, the examiner noted that it has "[n]ow resolved since avoiding close shaving of face". The examiner did not observe any facial scarring. The examiner did not find the Veteran's claimed skin condition to be related to service. The examiner's rationale for the negative nexus opinion was that "it would occur any time Veteran used a razor to obtain a close shave. There is no evidence to suggest this condition is caused by the military but is more likely than not [the] Veteran's skin reaction to using a razor before, during, and after military service".

Without a current diagnosed pseudofolliculitis barbae disability, the first foundational Shedden criterion of a current disability for service connection is not met. The Board understands that the Veteran may sincerely believe that he currently has pseudofolliculitis barbae; however, the record does not reflect the Veteran, a layperson, to have the medical training and expertise to opine competently on medical questions such as those presented in the instant case. Lay statements are not competent evidence regarding diagnosis or etiology in such case. See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007), Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Furthermore, any lay statements he has offered on the current situation are contradicted by the medical records that do not show any such scarring.

The Board finds the VA medical nexus opinions of record most probative for they were the most comprehensive in addressing the Veteran's statements, the medical evidence of record and their own observations of the Veteran on examination. Therefore, the evidence in this case is not so evenly balanced to require the application the of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule as required by law and VA regulations. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

As such, entitlement to service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae is denied.
