ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus granted.  

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's current tinnitus had onset in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1992 to June 1996, including service in Southwest Asia.

This case was docketed by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) based on a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), filed by the Veteran on August 15, 2024.  In the NOD, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  He identified the appealed issue as tinnitus and cited a May 2024 rating decision.  The May 2024 rating decision confirmed and continued a previous denial of service connection for tinnitus.  It found that new and relevant evidence had been received this claim, and this determination is binding upon the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

The instant decision results in a complete grant of the benefit sought and therefore delay in adjudicating this claim to allow the docket modification period to lapse would not benefit the Veteran and is therefore not warranted.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  

As to the evidentiary period, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the May 2024 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service department records confirm that the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was as an electrical / mechanical equipment repairman.  The Veteran had over a year of sea service and earned awards for Southwest Asia service.  

Service treatment records (STRs) do not show any complaint or treatment for tinnitus or associated symptoms.  However, they confirm that the Veteran was enrolled in a hearing conservation program.  May 1996 audiogram showed hearing acuity thresholds within normal limits.  

In December 2020, the Veteran had a VA-contract hearing loss examination with an audiologist.  In relevant part, the Veteran reported developing tinnitus right after separation.  It was intermittent and affected both ears.

In his original April 2023 service connection claim, the Veteran stated that he was stationed near bombers for nearly his entire enlistment.  He developed intermittent tinnitus, and it was becoming somewhat more intense.  

In February 2024, L.B., who is qualified as a Physician's Assistant, Certified (PA-C) and Occupational Hearing Conservationist, issued a positive medical opinion.  She conducted a complete review of the Veteran's medical history and noted the circumstances of his naval service.  She considered the Veteran's reports that he developed tinnitus right after separation.  She reviewed medical literature confirming that noise exposure can lead to tinnitus, chronic or noticeable tinnitus symptoms may arise after the noise exposure, and affected individuals may have normal audiograms.  She opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was due to military noise exposure and acoustic trauma.  

In May 2024, the Veteran had a VA-contract tinnitus examination with an audiologist.  The Veteran reported that he first noticed symptoms within a year of separation from military service.  The audiologist furnished a negative medical opinion.  She stated that there was no evidence that tinnitus was related to noise injury.  There was no evidence of hearing loss or significant hearing threshold changes during military service.  She cited a medical article finding that it was rare that noise exposure induced tinnitus was unaccompanied by hearing loss.  Without objective evidence of a noise injury and report of tinnitus in service, a link to service could not be established.  In the closing remarks, the audiologist noted that the Veteran denied significant noise exposure outside of military service.  During military service, he reported being exposed to excessive levels of noise from aircraft and various equipment associated with aircraft activity.  He first noticed tinnitus within a year of separation when he tried to sleep in quiet environments.  His tinnitus fluctuated in intensity and was most noticeable in quiet environments.  

For the following reasons, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to service.

The Veteran's reports and the May 2024 VA-contract examination report show a current tinnitus disability.

Service records reflect that the Veteran had a MOS as an electric / mechanical repairman.  The Veteran reports recurrent noise exposure throughout active service due to proximity to aircraft and associated activity.  STRs reflect that the Veteran was monitored in a hearing conservation program.  The Veteran's statements about military noise exposure are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service, and the Board finds them credible.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (each disabling condition for which a veteran seeks service connection must be considered based on factors including the basis of places, types, and circumstances of service as shown by service records).  Thus, military noise exposure is conceded, and the Veteran has met the in-service injury element.

The remaining issue is whether there is a relationship between in-service noise exposure and current tinnitus.  

The Veteran is competent to report tinnitus symptoms.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Both the December 2020 and May 2024 VA-contract audiologists noted reports of tinnitus symptoms beginning shortly after separation.  The evidence thus shows a date of onset shortly after separation.  

The February 2024 private medical opinion supports a relationship to service.  The clinician issuing the medical opinion is qualified as a PA-C with an additional certificate indicating hearing conservation expertise.  She conducted a complete review of the record and cited supporting medical literature for her opinion.  Thus, her positive medical opinion is entitled to probative weight.  

The May 2024 VA-contract medical opinion weighs against a relationship to service.  Although the VA-contract audiologist cites medical literature to support her medical opinion, she does not directly address the positive February 2024 medical opinion and its supporting medical literature.  Her comments appear to imply that some type of in-service documentation for decreased hearing acuity is necessary for a positive medical opinion.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Given these limitations with the May 2024 VA-contract medical opinion, the Board does not find it more persuasive than the February 2024 private medical opinion.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of a relationship to service for tinnitus is at least in a state of relative equipoise.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
