CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date of April 21, 2017 for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy were met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400 (2022).

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date of June 12, 2017 for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy were met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400 (2022).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Marine Corps from February 1980 to February 1984.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 Higher-Level-Review (HLR) decision, following an August 2022 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In August 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), electing the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after that decision cannot be considered.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Earlier Effective Dates

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than May 10, 2022 for the grants of service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, secondary to service-connected thoracolumbar degenerative arthritis, to include spinal stenosis and lumbosacral strain.

The assignment of an effective date for an award of disability compensation is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim or supplemental claim shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Veteran filed a new claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) for service connection for a low back disability in April 2016.  In a July 2016 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for a lumbosacral strain, effective April 21, 2016.  (The disability was ultimately recharacterized as a thoracolumbar spine disability, and the effective date was changed to March 17, 2016, the date the Veteran submitted an Intent to File a Claim.)  In July 2016, the Veteran appealed the initial rating, describing worsening symptoms relating to his back, legs, and feet.  In June 2017, he filed a new claim (VA Form 21-526), seeking a "back condition increase."  In a July 2017 letter, the AOJ notified the Veteran that it had received his claim, but that the AOJ was "already processing a pending appeal for lumbosacral strain."

In August 2022, the AOJ granted service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, assigning an effective date of May 10, 2022, the date VA received an Intent to File a Claim (though the Board cannot find any record of such).

The Board notes that, given the Veteran's appeal of the initial rating assigned for his thoracolumbar spine disability, if evidence of radiculopathy first became manifest during that pending appeal, the claim for an increased initial rating for the thoracolumbar spine disability necessarily encompassed a claim for service connection for secondary radiculopathy symptoms.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, Note 1 (providing for separate ratings for objective neurologic abnormalities associated with orthopedic disabilities); Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021) (38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2) requires that, when entitlement to secondary service connection is raised, a formal claim for secondary service connection need not be filed, rather, VA must consider those complications in connection with the claim on appeal).

The crucial question for the Board is the date entitlement arose.  Put another way, the question is when there was first evidence of manifestations of lower extremity radiculopathy.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For the reasons explained below, the Board finds that entitlement arose on April 21, 2017 for the right lower extremity, and on June 12, 2017 for the left lower extremity.  To this extent, then, entitlement to earlier effective dates are granted.

The relevant evidence shows that the Veteran first reported symptoms of right leg pain and numbness, radiating from his spine, in April 2017.  Specifically, a VA primary care record dated April 21, 2017 indicates his report of chronic low back pain to the right side with radiating pain into the right leg.  This marked the first time symptoms of right lower extremity pain were noted in the record.  The following month, the Veteran again reported right lower extremity pain during another primary care visit; the examiner ordered an MRI "to assess for radiculopathy."  The Veteran received an MRI on June 12, 2017, which revealed fairly severe degenerative changes with mild foraminal stenosis at the exit of the L3 bilaterally "with the right worse than the left."  A July 2022 VA medical opinion explained that the indication of bilateral stenosis in the MRI report meant that there was likely radiculopathy in both lower extremities; this is consistent with the "right worse than the left" statement, which implies at least some symptomatology on the left side.  Accordingly, the June 2017 MRI marks the first time symptoms of left lower extremity radiculopathy were noted in the record.  A subsequent VA Compensation and Pension (C&P) back examination, in October 2021, revealed symptoms consistent with sciatic radiculopathy in both lower extremities.

The Board concludes that the proper effective dates for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is April 21, 2017, and for left lower extremity radiculopathy is June 12, 2017, as those are the dates entitlement arose for each lower extremity, on a facts-found basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b) (providing that the effective date of an award will be the date of receipt of the claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later).  The Veteran does not assert, nor does the medical evidence show, that there were manifestations of lower extremity radiculopathy prior to those dates.  Notably, a June 2016 C&P back examination report was negative for radicular symptoms in the lower extremities.  Accordingly, to this extent, the Veteran's claims are granted.

As a final note, the Board finds that the issues of entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy were not denied, implicitly or explicitly, prior to the August 2022 rating decision which granted service connection.  The "implicit denial" rule provides that in certain circumstances, a claim for benefits will be deemed to have been denied, and thus finally adjudicated, even if VA did not expressly address that claim in its decision.  Adams v. Shinseki, 568 F.3d 956, 961 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Munro v. Shinseki, 616 F.3d 1293, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (the implicit denial rule applies to both formal and informal claims).  The implicit denial rule applies when the VA's decision provides a veteran with reasonable notice that his claim for benefits was denied.  Adams, 568 F.3d at 964.  Here, the rating for the Veteran's service-connected thoracolumbar spine disability was adjudicated in July 2016, May 2019, September 2020, November 2021, and May 2022 rating decisions.  None of those decisions discussed lower extremity symptoms or mentioned radiculopathy.  As such, the Veteran could not have been put on notice that claims for those benefits had been adjudicated until the August 2022 rating decision granting service connection.

REASONS FOR REMAND

3. Entitlement to an increased initial rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy, to include assigning an initial rating in the first instance from April 21, 2017 to May 10, 2022

4. Entitlement to an increased initial rating for left lower extremity radiculopathy, to include assigning an initial rating in the first instance from June 12, 2017 to May 10, 2022

The Veteran appealed the initial ratings assigned for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, from May 10, 2022; those issues are properly before the Board.  However, given the Board's decision to grant earlier effective dates for service connection, there are now unrated periods between the new effective dates and the effective date assigned by the AOJ (May 10, 2022).  By law, the AOJ, acting on behalf of the Secretary, makes the initial review or determination of a disability claim.  That decision is then "subject to one review on appeal" by the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  A final decision at this juncture would deprive the Veteran of his right to AOJ review in the first instance, and thus these matters must be remanded for such review in accordance with the law.  

Additionally, further evidentiary development is needed.  When the rating criteria do not contemplate the ameliorative effects of medication, such effects must be discounted when evaluating the severity of a service-connected condition.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012); Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (Mar. 12, 2025).  The Veteran's radiculopathy is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8520.  That DC does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication.  The Veteran received a VA C&P back examination in June 2022, during which he reported treating his back and lower extremity symptoms with physical therapy, heat treatment, back injections, topical cream, oral medications, and pain management.  However, the examiner's opinion does not indicate whether the ameliorative effects of treatment and medication were discounted when assessing the overall severity of the Veteran's symptoms.

As such, the C&P report of record is inadequate, which reflects a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  An updated VA examination is required.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  The clinician should provide a full description of the disabilities and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disabilities under the rating criteria.  The clinician should provide a detailed rationale in support of each pertinent finding.

When estimating the overall severity of the Veteran's radiculopathy, the clinician must attempt to discount the ameliorative effects of medication used to treat the Veteran's disabilities.

2. Readjudicate the issues of entitlement to increased initial ratings for the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, to include assigning initial ratings for the period from April 21, 2017 (for the right lower extremity) and from June 12,2017 (for the left lower extremity).  All indicated development should be completed, to include (if necessary) the provision of an additional VA examination to ascertain the severity of the Veteran's symptoms.
