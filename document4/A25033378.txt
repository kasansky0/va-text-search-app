TDIU

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability as his service-connected disabilities have precluded him from obtaining or following substantially gainful employment/occupation consistent with his experience, education, and training since December 1, 2018.

TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(1). Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19. In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). The fact that a Veteran is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough to warrant a TDIU. See, Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

As an initial matter, the Board has thoroughly reviewed and considered the argument presented by the Veteran's representative. The Board notes May 23, 2018 is the date of the VA examination which gave rise to entitlement for service connection of the Veteran's bowel condition. The Board finds this is not the appropriate date to establish continuous pursuit of a claim for an increased rating as it is merely the effective date and not tied to a claim for an increased rating. 

Nevertheless, the record indicates in December 2017 the Veteran submitted a claim for entitlement to service connection for right side drop foot as secondary to the Veteran's service connected back disability. See, VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) received December 2017. The AOJ interpreted and adjudicated the December 2017 claim as a claim for an increased rating for the Veteran's service connected peripheral neuropathy right lower extremity (previously rated as sciatica right leg). See, Rating Decision - Narrative February 2019. As this interpretation is, in this case, favorable to the Veteran, the Board will not disturb that interpretation and adopt the AOJ's interpretation of the December 2017 claim filed by the Veteran as one for an increased rating.

A request for TDIU is "part and parcel" of a claim for an increased disability rating and is not a separate freestanding claim itself but rather an alternate way to obtain a total disability rating without being rated 100 percent disabled under the Rating Schedule. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-55 (2009) (TDIU is implicitly raised whenever a veteran, who presents cogent evidence of unemployability, seeks to obtain a higher disability rating). Here, the Veteran submitted a claim for what has been interpreted as a claim for an increased rating and during the Veteran's continuous pursuit of that claim, the Veteran became unemployed. Thus, Rice, applies.

In this case, the Veteran has been service connected for neurological complication bowel urgency/incontinence associated with degenerative arthritis with intervertebral disc syndrome and spondylolisthesis with a disability rating of 60 percent effective May 23, 2018; sciatic neuropathy right lower extremity associated with degenerative arthritis with intervertebral disc syndrome and spondylolisthesis  with a disability rating of 10 percent effective July 8, 2004, 20 percent effective January 20, 2016, 20 percent effective December 18, 2017, and 40 percent effective February 2019; degenerative arthritis with intervertebral disc syndrome and spondylolisthesis with a disability rating of 20 percent effective April 4, 1975, 100 percent effective September 10, 2015, 40 percent effective February 1, 2016 and 40 percent effective August 2022; sciatic neuropathy left lower extremity associated with degenerative arthritis with intervertebral disc syndrome and spondylolisthesis with a disability rating of noncompensable effective May 10, 2007, 10 percent effective January 10, 2013, 20 percent effective January 20, 2016, and 40 percent effective August 18, 2022; pseudofolliculitis barbae with a disability rating of noncompensable effective June 6, 2006, and 30 percent effective August 18, 2022; hemorrhoids with a disability rating of 20 percent effective January 7, 2022; anterior neck disfigurement (scar neck) associated with pseudofolliculitis barbae with a disability rating of 10 percent effective June 14, 2021; and surgical scar mid-lower back with a noncompensable disability rating effective September 10, 2015. See, Rating Decision - Codesheet dated January 18, 2023. Hence, the Veteran has met the Schedular criteria for a TDIU since May 23, 2018. Therefore, the Board will examine whether the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of his service connected disabilities.

The evidence before the Board is the Veteran was last employed November 30, 2018. VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability received June 2021; Correspondence received June 2021; VA 21-4192 Request for Employment Information in Connection with Claim for Disability Benefits received November 2021.

The record contains opinions from the VA examiner and a private Vocational Specialist. See, C&P Exam received June 2021; C&P Exam received June 2021; C&P Exam received June 2021; C&P Exam received June 2021; Medical Treatment Record Non-Government Facility received December 2023.

The Board notes the VA opinion consists of 4 single page Individual Unemployability Statements by a Certified Medical Examiner, Family Nurse Practitioner, Nurse Practitioner - General Practice. See, C&P Exam received June 2021; C&P Exam received June 2021; C&P Exam received June 2021; C&P Exam received June 2021. The Board finds the VA opinion to be inadequate as it is internally inconsistent in that it says the Veteran has no work restrictions, sedentary work restriction, and no work restrictions but must be near a bathroom. Id. It is unclear to the Board if this VA examiner discussed the Veteran's limitations with the Veteran or reviewed the claims file. The Board affords this opinion little probative weight.

The Vocational Assessment produced by the Veteran concludes the Veteran has been unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment, including unskilled sedentary employment as a result of his service connected back condition, bilateral sciatic neuropathy, and fecal incontinence since at least December 2018. Medical Treatment Record Non-Government Facility received December 2023. The Board finds this opinion to be persuasive as it is based on input from the Veteran; the Veteran's education and work history; a thorough review of the Veteran's claims file with appropriate citations to the record; and is authored by a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor with a Master of Science of Rehabilitation Counseling. The Board affords this opinion significantly probative weight and value.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed and considered the medical and lay evidence in the Veteran's claims file. In consideration of such, and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded him from securing substantially gainful employment/occupation consistent with his experience, education and training beginning December 1, 2018. 

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; "Put differently, if the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance (which includes but not limited to equipoise), the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt." Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, entitlement to a TDIU is warranted. The claim is granted.

EARLIER EFFECTIVE DATES

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, shall be the later of the day following separation from service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is made within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2).

Additionally, when a veteran submits a claim to reopen a previously denied claim, and such claim is subsequently reopened and allowed, absent a claim of a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a prior final decision, and showing thereof, the effective date of the award of disability compensation shall be the date of receipt of the claim to reopen or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See, 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r); Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2005).

However, 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) provides an exception to this general rule. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1), if at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim. Section 3.156(c)(3) provides that if newly received, relevant service department records form all or part of the basis for the award of a benefit, then the effective date for such award is the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions applicable to the previously decided claim. See, Blubaugh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310, 1313 (noting that the purpose of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) is to place a claimant in the position they would have been in had VA considered the relevant service department record before the disposition of the earlier claim).

At the outset, the Board is mindful that effective March 24, 2015, VA updated the regulations concerning the filing of claims, adopting a standardized claims system. See, Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014). In part, VA replaced the informal / formal claims process with a standardized and more formal process. See, 79 Fed. Reg. at 57663-64; see also, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (effective March 24, 2015). The purpose of these amendments was to improve the quality and timeliness of the processing of veterans' claims for benefits by standardizing the claims and appeals processes through the use of specific VA forms. VA deleted former 38 C.F.R. § 3.157, which allowed for reports of examination or hospitalization to be treated as claims under certain circumstances, and completely rewrote 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, removing the provisions which allowed for the filing of informal claims.

Entitlement to the earlier effective date of December 1, 2018 for DEA Chapter 35 is granted. 

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an effective date earlier than August 18, 2022 for DEA Chapter 35. For the following reasons, the Board agrees.

Basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits for the child or surviving spouse of a veteran is established in one of several ways: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

Eligibility to DEA begins on any date between: (1) the effective date of the rating decision, and (2) the date notification to the person from whom eligibility is derived. 38 U.S.C. § 3512(a), (d).

As the Veteran has now been granted a TDIU effective December 1, 2018, the Board also concludes that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of December 1, 2018 for the grant of entitlement to DEA Chapter 35 under VA's laws and regulations. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021.

Entitlement to the earlier effective date of December 8, 2021 for service connection of hemorrhoids is granted.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an effective date earlier than January 7, 2022 for his service connected hemorrhoid condition. For the following reasons, the Board agrees. 

The AOJ granted the Veteran entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids, on a direct basis, with a 20 percent disability rating effective January 7, 2022. The AOJ based the effective date on an intent to file a claim the Veteran submitted in January 2022. VA 21-0966 Intent to File received January 2022; Notification Letter dated January 2023.

As an initial matter, the Veteran's service connected hemorrhoid condition for which he is seeking an earlier effective date was first diagnosed during VA examinations occurring during the development of the Veteran's claims for service connection or increased ratings of other disabilities. The Veteran did not make a formal claim for service connection for a hemorrhoid condition and, in this case, the regulations regarding the use of standardized forms are not relevant to the Board's analysis.

Thus, the question before the Board is when entitlement arose for service connection of the Veteran's hemorrhoid condition.

The Veteran's fecal incontinence was first raised during a VA examination for the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for "foot drop." C&P Exam received June 2018 and dated May 23, 2018. The Veteran formally submitted a claim for entitlement to fecal incontinence in January 2019. See, VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) received January 2019.

In a December 2018 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with mild or moderate internal or external hemorrhoids with a history of, but not currently, bleeding. See, C&P Exam received December 2018 at page 3. However, approximately two and a half years later, in a June 2021 VA examination, the Veteran was found not to have internal or external hemorrhoids. See, C&P Exam received June 2021. 

In December 2021 the VA examiner corrected the prior "erroneous diagnosis," and although the Veteran was again diagnosed with small to moderate external hemorrhoids, the VA examiner reported they were unrelated to the Veteran's service connected bowel urgency incontinence. See, C&P Exam received December 2021. The Veteran then submitted an intent to file a claim in December 2021. See, VA 21-0966 Intent to File received December 2021.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the medical and lay evidence of record including the Veteran's lay statements. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's VA treatment records mention hemorrhoids but do not include a diagnosis of a hemorrhoid condition. See, CAPRI received August 2022 at progress notes dated May 12, 2006 and May 15, 2007; CAPRI received November 2018 at progress note dated April 27, 2017.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Board shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; "Put differently, if the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt." Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Providing the benefit of the doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes the evidence is at least in approximate equipoise and therefore, entitlement to the earlier effective date of December 4, 2018, the date the Veteran was first diagnosed with a hemorrhoid condition during his pursuit of an increased rating for another service-connected disability, is warranted.

The claim is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 14, 2021 for service connection of anterior neck disfigurement (scar, neck) is denied.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an effective date earlier than June 14, 2021 for service connection of his anterior neck disfigurement (scar, neck) secondary to his pseudofolliculitis barbae. See, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement received November 2023 at page 9.

The AOJ granted service connection for the Veteran's anterior neck disfigurement (scar, neck) secondary to his service connected pseudofolliculitis barbae effective June 14, 2021 finding the Veteran's June 2021 application for increased compensation based on individual unemployability include a claim for an increased disability rating for his pseudofolliculitis barbae. See, Rating Decision - Narrative dated December 2022. 

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the Veteran' s supplemental claim application, lay statement and application for increased compensation based on individual unemployability received June 14, 2021. VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application received June 2021, VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability received June 2021, and Correspondence received June 2021. While the Board does not understand these submissions to be a request for an increased disability rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae, because the AOJ's interpretation results in a favorable finding for the Veteran, the Board will not disturb this finding.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the medical and lay evidence of record. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2007 for his pseudofolliculitis barbae. See, Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility received May 2007. This VA examination report does not include a finding of any scarring. Id. Likewise, the photographs that were ordered at the time of the April 2007 VA examination do not indicate scarring. See, Photographs received May 2007. Additional photographs were taken in April 2008 and do not indicate scarring. See, Photographs received March 2008. 

The record contains a progress note from February 2009 that reports the Veteran having "sparse, scattered fading red/hyperpigmentation macula-papules (some are erected) over both jaws." See, Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility received February 2009.

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in June 2021. See, C&P Exam received June 2021. This VA examiner reported scarring caused by the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae. Id. at page 14. A scars/disfigurement disability benefits questionnaire diagnosed the Veteran with hyperpigmentation of the anterior neck related to pseudofolliculitis barbae. See, C&P Exam received June 2021.

The Board's thorough review of the medical and lay evidence of record indicates the June 2021 VA examination report is the first diagnosis of scarring caused by the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae. Thus, adopting the favorable finding by the AOJ, the earliest date the Veteran's scarring was ascertainable would be the date of the receipt of the Veteran's claim for an increased disability is June 14, 2021.

The Board has considered the argument submitted by the Veteran, through his representative, and notes the argument does not address the issue of an earlier effective date for the Veteran's scarring caused by his pseudofolliculitis barbae. See, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement received November 2023.

The record also does not include statements by the Veteran, or on his behalf, during the one-year period prior to the June 2021 increased rating claim pertaining to his pseudofolliculitis barbae or its residuals such as scarring. Thus, the evidence does not show the Veteran's anterior neck disfigurement (scar, neck) caused by his pseudofolliculitis barbae was factually ascertainable within the one year period prior to the June 2021 increased rating claim.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the claim for an effective date earlier than June 14, 2021 for service connection of the Veteran's anterior neck disfigurement (scar, neck) caused by his pseudofolliculitis barbae must be denied.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding an effective date earlier than June 14, 2021 for service connection of his anterior neck disfigurement (scar, neck) caused by his pseudofolliculitis barbae, the benefit-of the doubt doctrine is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The claim is denied.

INCREASED RATINGS

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that a claimant may experience multiple distinct variations of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Entitlement to a disability rating of 100 percent effective May 19, 2024, but not before, for neurological complications, bowel urgency incontinence is granted.

Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran has been in possession of a 60 percent disability rating for his neurological complications, bowel urgency incontinence since May 23, 2018 pursuant to DC 7332. The Veteran contends he is entitled to a higher disability rating for this disability. As discussed more fully below, with the amendment to DC 7332 effective May 19, 2024, but not before, the Board agrees.

Effective May 19, 2024, Section 4.114 and DCs 7335-7332 were amended.

Generally, when a law or regulation changes after a claim has been filed, but before the administrative or judicial appeal process has been concluded, the version most favorable to the Veteran applies. VAOPGCPREC 11-97 (Mar. 24, 1997), VAOPGCPREC 3-2000 (April 10, 2000). In the usual course, the disability must be rated according to both the old and new rating criteria, and the Veteran must receive the benefit of the more favorable rating schedule.

Pursuant to VA General Counsel Opinion, a new law or regulation has prohibited "retroactive effects" if it is less favorable to a claimant than the old law or regulation; while a liberalizing law or regulation does not have "retroactive effects." If there are no resulting retroactive effects, VA ordinarily must apply the new provision - however, at no point prior to the effective date of that provision. See, VAOPGCPREC 7-2003 (Nov. 19, 2003); 69 Fed. Reg. 25179 (2004); see also, 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114. Because the effective date of the new regulation - May 19, 2024 - is after the evidence window closed in this Direct docket case, the older regulation was in effect at the time of the rating decision.

DC 7332, in relative part, at the close of the record, which is pre- May 19, 2024, assigns a 60 percent disability rating for "extensive leakage and fairly frequent involuntary bowel movements." A 100 percent disability rating is provided for "complete loss of sphincter control." 

Effective May 19, 2024, DC 7332 was amended, in relative part, to assign a 100 percent rating for complete loss of sphincter control characterized by incontinence or retention that is not responsive to physician-prescribed bowel program and requires either surgery or digital stimulation, medication (beyond laxative use) and special diet; or incontinence to solids and/or liquids two or more times per day, which requires changing a pad two or more times per day. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7332 (emphasis added).

The Board has thoroughly reviewed all of the medical and lay evidence of record.

During the period on appeal, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. C&P Exam received December 2022. The VA examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of neurological complications of back conditions including bowel urgency/incontinence. Id. at page 2. The VA examiner acknowledged the Veteran's reports that he wears "adult diapers and uses 2/day on average" with fecal incontinence episodes about 5 times per week on average; fecal urgency with a warning period of only about 10 to 20 seconds; and with stools that are usually formed but occasionally in the form of diarrhea. Id. The VA examiner reported the Veteran has impairment of rectal sphincter resulting in leakage that necessitates wearing of a pad, constant slight leakage and occasional involuntary bowel movements. Id. at pages 2-3.

The VA examiner reported the Veteran's neurological complications of back conditions including bowel urgency/incontinence impacted the Veteran's ability to work and prevented the Veteran from maintaining substantially gainful employment doing physical or sedentary work.

The Board's thorough review of the record indicates prior to the May 19, 2024 amendment to DC 7332, the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 60 percent for his neurological complications of back conditions including bowel urgency/incontinence. However, with the May 19, 2024 amendment to DC 7332, the Veteran's incontinence to solids and/or liquids two or more times per day which require the changing of a pad two or more times per day satisfies the criteria, pursuant to DC 7332 as amended, for a 100 percent disability rating. 

When considering this rating, the Board has considered the impact of functional loss in the Veteran's neurological complications of back conditions including bowel urgency/incontinence. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 206 (1995). Here, the Veteran contends that his neurological complications of back conditions including bowel urgency/incontinence has worsened. However, while the Veteran experiences symptoms, overall, it does not appear that these symptoms resulted in complete loss of sphincter control which was required for the higher rating of 100 percent under the pre-amended DC 7332. Thus, prior to May 19, 2024, the symptoms complained of by the Veteran are adequately contemplated in the rating he received prior to the May 19, 2024 amendment to DC 7332.

Although the Veteran does not have the medical expertise to identify the specific level of disability of the Veteran's neurological complications of back conditions including bowel urgency/incontinence according to the appropriate diagnostic code, the record contains competent evidence from medical personnel who have examined the Veteran during the current appeal. These medical personnel have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with the evaluations which directly address the criteria under which these disabilities are evaluated.

The Board has also considered the occupation and social functioning lost due to the Veteran's neurological complications of back conditions including bowel urgency/incontinence, and finds the award of a TDIU effective December 1, 2018, as discussed previously, is contemplated to compensate the Veteran for this loss. 

Here, prior to May 19, 2024, the record indicates the Veteran did not have a finding of complete loss of sphincter control and thus, under the pre- May 19, 2024 amendment DC 7332, a disability rating in excess of 60 percent is not warranted. However, effective May 19, 2024, the Veteran's symptomology satisfies the criteria for a 100 percent rating pursuant to the amended DC 7332.

The Board finds that the evidence is persuasively in favor of finding, effective May 19, 2024, but not before, the Veteran's neurological complications of back conditions including bowel urgency/incontinence. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.124a, DC 7332 (2023 and 2024). 

Entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 20 percent for hemorrhoids is denied.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an initial disability rating greater than 20 percent for his service connected hemorrhoid condition. The Veteran has been in receipt of a 20 percent disability rating for his hemorrhoids effective January 7, 2022. 

As previously discussed, the Board has granted the Veteran the earlier effective date of December 5, 2018 for service connection for his hemorrhoid condition.

During the pendency of the appeal, the rating criteria for Diagnostic Code 7336 was amended May 19, 2024. If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g). If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110. Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to May 19, 2024, and both the old and new rating criteria as of May 19, 2024, applying the criteria that is more favorable to him.

In this regard, prior to May 19, 2024, a noncompensable rating is assigned for mild or moderate hemorrhoid symptoms; a 10 percent rating is assigned for large or thrombotic, irreducible hemorrhoids with excessive redundant tissue, evidencing frequent recurrences; and a maximum 20 percent rating is assigned for hemorrhoids with persistent bleeding and with secondary anemia, or with fissures.

As of May 19, 2024, under Diagnostic Code 7336, a 10 percent rating is assigned for prolapsed internal hemorrhoids with two or less episodes per year of thrombosis; or external hemorrhoids with three or more episodes per year of thrombosis; and a maximum 20 percent rating is assigned for evidence of internal or external hemorrhoids with persistent bleeding and anemia; or continuously prolapsed internal hemorrhoids with three or more episodes per year of thrombosis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114.

Under either the criteria prior to May 19, 2024 or the revised DC 7336 effective May 19, 2024, the maximum Schedular disability rating is 20 percent.

The Board has considered whether the Veteran's hemorrhoid condition is such that would warrant an extraschedular evaluation. 

The Veteran was afforded numerous VA examinations in this matter. 

The December 2018 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with mild or moderate small external hemorrhoids with a history of, but not currently, bleeding. See, C&P Exam received December 2018. As previously discussed, the June 2021 VA examiner did not diagnose the Veteran with internal or external hemorrhoids. See, C&P Exam received June 2021. The December 2021 VA examiner corrected the prior "erroneous diagnosis," and although the Veteran was again diagnosed with small to moderate external hemorrhoids, but the VA examiner reported they were unrelated to the Veteran's service connected bowel urgency incontinence. See, C&P Exam received December 2021.

The December 2022 VA examination confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of hemorrhoids with flare-ups of painful hemorrhoids with bleeding several times per month; large or thrombotic, irreducible, with excessive redundant tissue, evidencing frequent recurrences; and persistent bleeding. See, C&P Exam received December 2022. 

The Board finds no exceptional or unusual factors with regard to the Veteran's hemorrhoid condition that would warrant an extraschedular evaluation. Here, DC 7336 specifically contemplates the Veteran's symptomology associated with his hemorrhoids. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7336. Accordingly, referral to the Director, Compensation Service, for consideration of an extraschedular rating is not warranted as the manifestation of the Veteran's disability is accounted for in the schedular rating assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 3.321; Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008), aff'd sub nom., Thun v. Shinseki, 572 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

The Board has considered the Veteran's argument in support of this appeal. See, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement received November 2023. The Board notes the argument does not address the issue of why the Veteran believes he is entitled to a disability rating in excess of the Schedular maximum for his service connected hemorrhoids. The record also does not contain a lay statement by the Veteran on this point.

The Board has considered whether other DCs would provide the Veteran with a higher benefit and finds no other DC under which the Veteran would be more appropriately evaluated. 

In conclusion, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's service connected hemorrhoids. As the evidence is persuasively against a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's service connected hemorrhoid condition, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

The claim is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating greater than 30 percent for pseudofolliculitis barbae is denied.

After submitting a supplemental claim on August 18, 2022, the Veteran's disability rating for his pseudofolliculitis barbae was increased from noncompensable to 30 percent effective August 18, 2022 pursuant to DC 7813. See, Rating Decision - Narrative dated January 2023. The Veteran contends it should be higher.

DC 7813 is rated using the General Rating Formula for the Skin. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

As is relevant here, a rating of 30 percent disabling under the General Rating Formula involves characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or, systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.

A rating of 60 percent disabling under the General Rating Formula, the highest Schedular rating available, involves characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or, constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.

VA defines "topical therapy" as "treatment that is administered through the skin." See, 38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a). VA now defines "systemic therapy" as "treatment that is administered through any route (orally, injection, suppository, intranasally) other than the skin." Id. 

The Board has considered all the evidence of record, lay and medical, as it bears on the issue of rating the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae. See, Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of a disability, or symptoms of disability, susceptible of lay observation).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in this matter. C&P Exam received December 2022.

In the December 2022 VA examination, the VA examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae which is treated with topical corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, as well as benzoyl peroxide wash and clindamycin swabs, for 6 weeks or more, but not constant, during the prior 12 months. C&P Exam received December 2022 at pages 1-2. The VA examiner reported the Veteran's dermatitis affected less than 5 percent of the Veteran's total body area and 20 to 40 percent of his exposed area. Id. at page 3. The VA examiner reported the Veteran did not have acne, chloracne, vitiligo, scarring alopecia, alopecia areata, hyperhidrosis, chronic urticaria, primary cutaneous vasculitis, erythroderma, erythema multiforme, or toxic epidermal necrolysis; tumors or neoplasms; or scarring or disfigurement. Id. at pages 3-4. The VA examiner also reported the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae did not impact his ability to do physical or sedentary work. Id. at page 4. The Board acknowledges this VA examination report is uncontroverted and affords it persuasive probative weight.

The record does not indicate the Veteran had characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.

The Board has also reviewed and considered the Veteran's argument in support of this appeal as well as the Veteran's lay statements contained within the evidentiary window and finds they do not address the issue of a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae.

The Board has considered whether another DC would provide the Veteran with a higher benefit and finds no other DC under which the Veteran would be more appropriately evaluated.

The Board recognizes an earlier VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with hyperpigmentation of the anterior neck related to pseudofolliculitis barbae. See, C&P Exam (Skin Diseases Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)) received June 2021; C&P Exam (Scars/Disfigurement DBQ) received June 2021. As discussed more fully below, the Veteran is being compensated for this disability separately as the AOJ has assigned a separate rating for the Veteran's hyperpigmentation of the anterior neck.

In conclusion, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's service connected pseudofolliculitis barbae. As the evidence is persuasively against a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's service connected pseudofolliculitis barbae, the benefit-of-the-doubt rules does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

The claim is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating greater than 10 percent for anterior neck disfigurement (scar, neck) is denied.

The Veteran is currently in possession of a disability rating of 10 percent for his service connected anterior neck disfigurement (scar, neck) pursuant to DC 7800 effective June 14, 2021. The Veteran contends he is entitled to a higher disability rating.

As an initial matter, the Board recognizes that the VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018. However, DC 7800 was not changed by the August 13, 2018, amendments.

Pursuant to DC 7800 a 10 percent disability rating is assigned for a burn scar of the head, face, or neck, a scar of the head, face, or neck due to other causes, or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck involves one characteristic of disfigurement. See, 38 C.F.R. § 4.118; DC 7800. The possible characteristics for disfigurement are: (1) a scar 5 or more inches (13 or more centimeters) in length; (2) a scar at least one-quarter inch (0.6 centimeters) wide at the widest part; (3) surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation; (4) a scar adherent to underlying tissue; (5) skin hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches (39 square centimeters); (6) skin texture abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding six square inches (39 square centimeters); (7) underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding six square inches (39 square centimeters); and (8) skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches (39 square centimeters). Id., Note 1.

A 30 percent disability rating is assigned for a scar or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck that involves visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features - nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips, or with two or three characteristics of disfigurement. See, 38 C.F.R. § 4.118; DC 7800. See also, Id. at Note 1.

A rating of 50 percent disabling is assigned for a scar or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck involving visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features, or with four or five characteristics of disfigurement. Id.

A rating of 80 percent disabling, the highest Schedular rating under DC 7800, is assigned for a scar or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck involving visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features or paired sets of features or with six or more characteristics of disfigurement.

The Board has considered all of the medical and lay evidence contained in the evidence window regarding the assigned disability rating for the Veteran's neck disfigurement (scar, neck). See, Davidson v. Shinseki, 582 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in this matter. C&P Exam received June 2021. The VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with an anterior neck disfigurement of hyperpigmentation measuring 19 centimeters in length and 9 centimeters in width for a total area of 171 square centimeters. Id. at page 17. The VA examiner found no evidence of elevation; depression; adherence to underlying tissue or missing underlying soft tissue; no induration/inflexibility; no abnormal texture; and no gross distortion or asymmetry of facial features or visible or palpable tissue loss. Id.

The Board's thorough review of the medical and lay evidence contained within the evidentiary window indicates no discussion of the Veteran's neck disfigurement associated with pseudofolliculitis barbae outside of the June 2021 VA examination.

Thus, upon review, the Board finds the weight of the evidence contained in the evidence window shows that the Veteran's neck disfigurement (scar, neck) involves only one characteristic of disfigurement. See, 38 C.F.R. § 4.118; DC 7800.

Specifically, the only characteristic of disfigurement present in the Veteran's anterior neck disfigurement (scar, neck) is hyperpigmentation measuring 19 centimeters in length and 9 centimeters in width for a total area of 171 square centimeters. Otherwise, the disfigurement does not adhere to underlying tissue without underlying soft tissue missing much less have underlying tissue missing in an area of 6 square inches or 39 square centimeters. Id. The skin texture is normal, non-fibrous, and flexible throughout and therefore below the required 6 square inches or 39 square centimeters threshold to meet this characteristic of disfigurement. Id. 

The next highest rating of 30 percent disabling requires both visible or palpable tissue loss, and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features, or two or three characteristics of disfigurement. See, 38 C.F.R. § 4.118; DC 7800. There is no evidence the Veteran's neck disfigurement rises to the level of gross distortion or asymmetry or involves tissue loss. Finally, as previously noted, the scar involves only one characteristic of disfigurement, not two or three.

The Board has also considered the other DCs pertaining to scars. The disfigurement's location on the Veteran's neck precludes the scar from receiving a rating under DC 7801 and 7802, the scar is neither deemed unstable nor painful as contemplated under DC 7804, and the evidence of record does not raise any disabling effects not already considered in a rating under DCs 7800 through 7804.

In conclusion, the evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for his anterior neck disfigurement (scar, neck). The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is therefore not for application and the claim for an increased rating must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for surgical scar mid-lower back is denied.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a compensable disability rating for his mid-lower back surgical scar.

The Veteran's scar is rated pursuant to DC 7802, which rates burns scars or scars due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Under those criteria, a 10 percent rating is only permitted when the area or areas affected cover 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802.

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations in connection with his claim in June 2021 and December 2022. C&P Exam received June 2021; C&P Exam received December 2022.

The December 2022 VA examiner reported the Veteran's mid-lower back surgical scar is the result of his service-connected decompression and spinal fusion surgery in September 2015. See, C&P Exam received December 2022. The VA examiner observed the Veteran's scar was not painful; not unstable; and not due to burns. Id. at page 2. The VA examiner found the Veteran's scar to be without underlying tissue damage; and did not result in the limitation of function including limitation of motion. Id. at pages 2-3. The VA examiner measured the Veteran's scar of the mid-lower back to be 10 x 1 centimeters. Id. at page 2.

The prior VA examination in June 2021 noted no objective evidence that the Veteran's mid-lower back scar was painful; unstable; due to burns; tender to palpation; or have underlying soft tissue damage. See, C&P Exam received June 2021. This VA examiner reported the Veteran's mid-lower back scar measured with an approximate total area of 2 squared centimeters.

The record indicates the Veteran's scar is nonlinear and not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Further, his scar is no greater than 2 square centimeters and does not comprise an area large enough to qualify for a compensable rating under the applicable rating criteria.

The Board has reviewed the argument submitted by the Veteran's representative as well as the Veteran's lay statements. The Board notes neither the argument submitted, nor the Veteran's lay statements contained within the evidentiary window allege the Veteran's mid-lower back scar to be unstable or painful.

The Board has considered whether any of the other rating codes applicable to scars may be applied in this analysis but finds that they should not. The mid-lower back scar in question does not affect the head, face, or neck (DC 7800), do not include underlying soft tissue damage (DC 7801), and are not reported to be painful or unstable (DC 7804). Thus, there is no rating criteria which may give rise to a higher rating.

As such, a compensable rating is not supported at this time and the claim is denied. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, because the evidence is against the claim, that doctrine does not apply. See, 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

The claim is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating greater than 40 percent for degenerative arthritis with intervertebral disc syndrome and spondylolisthesis is denied.

The Veteran is currently in possession of a disability rating of 40 percent for his degenerative arthritis with intervertebral disc syndrome and spondylolisthesis pursuant to DC 5243, which the Veteran contends should be higher. For the following reasons the Board disagrees.

When assessing the severity of a musculoskeletal disability that is at least partly rated on the basis of limitation of motion, VA must also consider the extent that the Veteran may have additional functional impairment above and beyond the limitation of motion objectively demonstrated, such as during times when the symptoms are most prevalent ("flare-ups") due to the extent of his or her pain (and painful motion), weakness, premature or excess fatigability, and incoordination-assuming these factors are not already contemplated by the governing rating criteria. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 204-07 (1995).

Effective February 7, 2021, the application of DCs 5242 and 5243 were revised as follows: DC 5242, which contemplates degenerative arthritis, now includes degenerative disc disease, and DC 5243, which contemplates IVDS, is to be assigned only when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve root. The rating criteria for Diagnostic Codes 5235-5241 and the general rating formula for diseases and injuries of the spine were not revised. 

Ratings under the General Spinal Formula are made with or without symptoms such as pain (whether or not it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the area of the spine affected by residuals of injury or disease.

As is relevant here, a 10 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or a combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees; or muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Spinal Formula.

A 20 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis or abnormal kyphosis.

A 30 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the cervical spine, 15 degrees or less, or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine.

A 40 percent rating requires evidence of forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. Id.

A 50 percent evaluation is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. Id. Finally, a 100 percent evaluation is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. Id.

For VA compensation purposes, normal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is 0 to 90 degrees, extension is 0 to 30 degrees, left and right lateral extension are 0 to 30 degrees and left and right lateral rotation are 0 to 30 degrees. Id. Note (2). The combined range of motion (ROM) refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right lateral rotation. Id. The normal combined ROM for thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees. Id. Each ROM measurement is to be rounded to the nearest five degrees. Id. Note (4).

Unfavorable ankylosis is "a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching." Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis. Id. Note (5). The criteria for a rating based on ankylosis may be met by evidence demonstrating the functional equivalent of ankylosis. See, Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 20 (2021). Thus, a higher rating may be warranted by showing that the level of impairment most closely approximates the level of functional loss contemplated by favorable or unfavorable ankylosis under the General Rating Formula.

Any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including but not limited to bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under the appropriate diagnostic codes. Id. Note (1).

Under the IVDS Formula, a spine disability is rated based on the presence of incapacitating episodes, which are defined as periods of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that require bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5243, IVDS Formula, Note (1). A 20 percent rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks. Id. A 40 percent rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks during the past 12 months. Id. A 60 percent rating, which is the maximum, is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the past 12 months. Id.

The Board's review of the VA examinations afforded to the Veteran indicate that, although the Veteran has had flexion at 30 degrees or less, the Veteran has never had unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine, unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine, or IVDS with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the prior 12 months. C&P Exam received December 2022; C&P Exam received June 2021. Thus, the criteria for any rating in excess of 40 percent for the Veteran's degenerative arthritis, IVDS and spondyloschisis under DC 5243 is not warranted.

The Board has reviewed all of the medical and lay evidence of record.

In considering the appropriate disability ratings, the Board has considered the lay statements of the Veteran. In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence and account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and prove the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the Veteran. See, Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994).

The Board finds the Veteran to be competent to report and discuss his symptomology to include pain. Barr v, Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307 (2007). The record does not, however, indicate the Veteran has the medical expertise to render opinions regarding the degree of impairment caused by the Veteran's disability. See, Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When considering this rating, the Board has considered the impact of functional loss in the Veteran's back due to flare-ups of pain, fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, and weakness. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 206 (1995). Here, the Veteran contends that his back condition has worsened. However, while the Veteran experiences symptoms, overall, it does not appear that these symptoms result in additional and significant functional loss equivalent to ankylosis as he still has some range of motion (ROM) in his back and the symptomology complained of by the Veteran is adequately contemplated in the rating he receives. See, Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 37-43 (2011).

Although the Veteran does not have the medical expertise to identify the specific level of disability of the Veteran's back condition according to the appropriate diagnostic code, the record contains competent evidence from medical personnel who have examined the Veteran during the current appeal. These medical personnel have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with the evaluations which directly address the criteria under which these disabilities are evaluated.

The Board has also considered the occupation and social functioning lost due to the Veteran's degenerative arthritis, IVDS and spondyloschisis, and finds the award of a TDIU effective December 1, 2018, as discussed previously, is contemplated to compensate the Veteran for this loss.

Here, throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran has not had a finding of unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine; or unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine; or IVDS with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the prior 12 months. Thus, an evaluation in excess of 40 percent for the Veteran's degenerative arthritis, IVDS and spondyloschisis pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Spinal Formula is not warranted.

Entitlement to a disability rating greater than 40 percent for sciatic nerve left lower extremity is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating greater than 40 percent for sciatic nerve right lower extremity is denied.

For the period on appeal, the Veteran has been in possession of a 40 percent disability rating pursuant to DC 8520 for his sciatic neuropathy, right lower extremity since February 24, 2019 and August 18, 2022 for his sciatic neuropathy, left lower extremity. The Veteran contends his disability ratings for his bilateral sciatic nerve lower extremity should be higher. For the following reasons, the Board disagrees.

Under the criteria of DC 8520, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, where the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost, is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520. The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. 

"Mild" is generally defined as "not severe" or "temperate." Merriam-Webster's Dictionary (merriam-webster.com/dictionary). "Moderate" is generally defined as "tending toward the mean or average amount." Id. "Severe" is generally defined as" of a great degree." Id. "Marked" means having a distinctive or emphasized character. See, Stover v. McDonough, 25 Vet. App. 394, 407 (2022) ("[W]hen the Board adjudicates a claim, it must explain what it understands the relevant legal standard to be.").

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See, 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence, to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. It should also be noted that the use of terminologies such as "severe" by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue. All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is assigned at the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See, Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the medical and lay evidence contained within the evidentiary window.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in this matter. See, C&P Exam received December 2022. The VA examiner reported the Veteran has bilateral lower extremity radicular pain with moderate constant pain, severe intermittent pain, severe paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and severe numbness. Id. at page 14. The VA examiner indicated the Veteran's bilateral sciatic nerve was involved, but that the Veteran had no other signs or symptoms of radiculopathy. Id. at pages 14-15. Finally, the VA examiner reported the Veteran does not have muscle atrophy. Id. at page 11. The Board notes this medical opinion is uncontroverted.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the Veteran's VA treatment records and has found no indication of muscle atrophy. See, e.g., CAPRI received November 2018; CAPRI received November 2021; CAPRI received December 2021; CAPRI received August 2022.

On review, the Board finds the December 2022 VA examination to be adequate to address the question presented. The examiner conducted an in-person evaluation with appropriate testing; considered the Veteran's statements prior to forming an opinion; and is supported by the record. Further, as noted previously, the opinion as to the severity of the Veteran's sciatic bilateral lower extremity is uncontroverted. Thus, the Board gives this opinion great probative weight.

In this case, the VA examiner noted an assessment of moderate and severe radiculopathy pain but did not find marked muscle atrophy which is necessary for a disability rating of 60 percent under DC 8520. Further, the VA examiner found decreased sensory in the Veteran's foot/toes but did not find complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve including foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost which is necessary for the maximum Schedular rating of 80 percent under DC 8520.

The Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against finding the Veteran's sciatic, left lower extremity, or sciatic right lower extremity, warrants a rating in excess of 40 percent at any time during the period on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.124a, DC 8520.

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. The claims are denied.
