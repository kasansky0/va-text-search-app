FINDING OF FACT

The decision not to adjudicate the Veteran's claim was predicated on factual inaccuracy.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran's August 2022 supplemental claim and November 2023 requests for higher-level review (HLR) were valid and timely submissions. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Navy from May 1989 to June 2007. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 decision letter issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As such, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after that cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, since the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in its adjudication. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Procedural History

Within one year of separation, on July 16, 2007, the Veteran submitted a service-connection claim for bilateral hearing loss. In February 2008, the AOJ issued a decision, which granted the claim, and a 10 percent rating was assigned, effective June 26, 2007, the day following separation from active service. 

Within one year of its issuance (and still within one year of separation), on March 7, 2008, the Veteran filed a TDIU claim, which included an initial service-connection claim for a bilateral knee disability and an increased rating claim for bilateral hearing loss. In July 2008, the AOJ issued a decision, which denied the claim. The Veteran did not file a substantive appeal and new and material evidence was not received within one year of its issuance. Subject to revision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE), that decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

In February 2014, a routine future examination was scheduled to assess the current severity of the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss. In March 2014, the AOJ issued a decision, which confirmed and continued the assigned 10 percent rating based on that examination. The Veteran did not file a substantive appeal and new and material evidence was not received within one year of its issuance. Subject to revision based on CUE, that decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

At any time after a decision is final, the claimant may request, or VA may initiate, review of the decision to determine if there was a [CUE] in the decision. Where evidence establishes such error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1). That is exactly what happened in this case.

On November 2, 2018, the Veteran submitted an intent to file. A few days later, on November 8, 2018, he filed a request to reopen the bilateral knee claim most recently addressed in a July 2008 rating decision, to include a new increased rating claim for bilateral hearing loss (currently evaluated as 10 percent disabling), and entitlement to a TDIU. 

In January 2019, the AOJ issued a decision, which revised the July 2008 rating decision based on CUE and thereby granted entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee degenerative arthritis. Separate 10 percent ratings were assigned for the right and left knee. The effective dates for those awards were October 25, 2007, and December 19, 2007, respectively. Entitlement to SMC A&A was also granted. The effective date of that award was November 2, 2018, the date VA received the intent to file. The issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss was denied. Lastly, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU was determined to be moot.

The Veteran appealed that decision, which included a revision of the July 2008 decision. That is to say that he timely filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) under the legacy review system, seeking the highest possible rating and earliest possible effective date for bilateral knee degenerative arthritis, SMC A&A, and bilateral hearing loss. See November 2019 NOD. In April 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, which was accepted as a timely opt-in to the modernized review system (AMA) by way of a statement of the case (SOC) issued the previous month. See March 2020 SOC.

In June 2020, the AOJ issued an HLR decision, which denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for the initial evaluation of the Veteran's bilateral knee degenerative arthritis and entitlement to SMC housebound prior to November 2, 2018. A rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss was also denied. The issue of entitlement to an increased rating for the Veteran's bilateral knee degenerative arthritis was deferred to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error and to obtain an adequate VA examination. Consequently, the matter was returned to the rating activity and placed into the supplemental review lane for further development.

In July 2020, apparently by its own initiative, the AOJ issued a rating decision, which re-iterated its denial of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss but determined that the disability was static; essentially deciding that re-examination was unnecessary.

In October 2020, the aforesaid development to assess the severity of the Veteran's bilateral knee disability was completed. Later that month, the AOJ issued a supplemental review rating decision, which denied entitlement to ratings in excess of 10 percent for bilateral knee degenerative arthritis. See October 2020 Rating Decision.

Several months later, effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for disabilities of the knee and leg. The amended Diagnostic Code 5257 provides ratings for other impairment of the knee based on recurrent subluxation or instability, and patellar instability. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

On June 30, 2021, the Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, requesting review of the July and October 2020 rating (non-HLR) decisions, which denied increased ratings for his bilateral hearing loss and bilateral knee disability, to include entitlement to SMC A&A. On August 23, 2021, the AOJ issued an HLR decision, citing a "difference of opinion" as the October 2020 VA knee examination was found inadequate for rating purposes under the amended criteria. Like before, the matter was returned to the rating activity and placed to the supplemental review lane for further development with instructions to (1) establish an EP 040 (supplemental claim) and (2) obtain a new VA knee examination that was adequate for rating purposes. See August 2021 Rating Decision.

After development was completed, in September 2021, the AOJ issued a supplemental review decision, which granted separate 10 percent evaluations for the Veteran's bilateral knee instability (DC 5257). The effective date was October 8, 2020, the date of the new VA knee examination. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss was again denied. The issues of entitlement to separate ratings in excess of 10 percent for bilateral knee instability and degenerative arthritis were deferred for yet another VA examination. See September 2021 Rating Decision. After development was completed, in December 2021, the AOJ issued another supplemental review decision, which denied separate ratings in excess of 10 percent for bilateral knee instability and degenerative arthritis.

Within one year of its issuance, in August 2022, the Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issues of entitlement to an earlier effective date and ratings in excess of 10 percent for bilateral knee degenerative arthritis and instability, to include entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss, which were most recently addressed in the August, September, and December 2021 rating decisions. See August 2022 VA Form 20-0995. 

From there, the AOJ effectively stonewalled the Veteran's claim. Compare November 2022 Incorrectly Established Claim Letter with July 2023 Request for Application Letter and March 2024 Subsequent Development Letter (hereinafter "rejection letters"). For example, the August 2022 VA Form 20-0995 was treated as a request for an application in future correspondence. The first two letters mischaracterized the supplemental claim as an initial claim for increase and misdirected procedure (i.e., file a VA Form 21-526EZ). To be clear, the Veteran's August 2022 claim was not an initial claim for increase (or new claim). It was clearly a supplemental claim. See August 2022 VA Form 20-0995 (Blocks 13A-B). 

On November 21, 2022, the AOJ issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied an earlier effective date for bilateral knee instability and SMC A&A. However, it did not address the issues of entitlement to separate ratings in excess of 10 percent for bilateral knee degenerative arthritis and instability, to include entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss. Consequently, the claim remains pending. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(c).

Within one year of the prior decision, on November 3, 2023, the Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, and requested review of the November 2022 supplemental claim decision in its denial of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the initial rating of bilateral knee instability and SMC A&A. Still within one year of the prior decision, on November 17, 2023, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, and requested review of the rejection letters issued in November 2022 and July 2023, which essentially declined adjudication of the above mentioned issues found as part of a valid supplemental claim.

In March 2024, the AOJ issued an HLR decision, which denied entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 8, 2020, for the initial 10 percent ratings assigned for bilateral knee instability. The issue of entitlement to SMC A&A was returned for correction of a duty to assist error and the matter was deferred for additional development. Later that month, on March 27, 2024, VA rejected the Veteran's November 17, 2023, HLR request seeking increased ratings for BHL, bilateral knees (generally), and bilateral knee instability. March 2024 Subsequent Development Letter ("rejection letter" or "decision letter"). This appeal followed.

The rejection letters issued November 25, 2022, July 18, 2023, and March 27, 2024, are void.

By way of his attorney, the Veteran contends that the basis for the rejection letter was improper because his August 4, 2022, submission was a timely and valid appeal of the August 2021, September 2021, and December 2021 rating decisions.

A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the following administrative review options, as specified (except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c), (e), and (f) of this section), after any decision by the agency of original jurisdiction, Board of Veterans' Appeals, or by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, provided that any appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is timely filed as determined by the court: (1) Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. (2) Following notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. (See appeal to the Board, 38 CFR 20.202). (3) Following notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. (4) Following a decision on an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the claimant may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

Therefore, the Veteran asserts that it was improper to instruct him to file this appeal on the incorrect form, as a supplemental claim filed within one year of a decision is one means of continuously pursuing a claim. See May 2024 Appellate Brief.

The Board agrees. 

VA letters rejecting the Veteran's supplemental claim and HLR requests each constitute a decision. Because the Veteran filed a timely appeal, the Board retains jurisdiction to review the matter.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a), the Secretary must decide all questions of law and fact necessary to a determination of benefits. A "decision" includes any AOJ action that adjudicates such questions. VA regulations clarify that a decision from the agency of original jurisdiction is final only if proper notice is provided (38 C.F.R. § 3.104(a)), and even then, it does not become final until one year passes without the filing of an appeal. Furthermore, 38 U.S.C. § 5104(a) requires the Secretary to provide written notice of any decision affecting benefits, including reasons for the decision and options for further review.

A decision need not take the form of a traditional rating decision to qualify as adjudicative. When VA correspondence decides affecting entitlement to benefits and resolves a legal issue (e.g., whether a filing is timely) it meets the definition of a "decision" under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a). Once issued, such decisions are binding unless appealed within the prescribed period. However, the legal effect of a decision is stayed during the one-year appeal window. If the claimant initiates an appeal within that period, the decision is not final and remains subject to further review.

In this case, VA letters rejecting the Veteran's August 2022 supplemental claim and November 2023 HLR requests did more than perform a ministerial function - they made legal determinations that the claims could not proceed. This is adjudicative in nature and qualifies as a "decision." The Veteran responded by timely submitting a VA Form 10182 to appeal the rejection to the Board. As such, the Board maintains jurisdiction to review the merits.

With respect to the initial ratings assigned for a bilateral knee disability, the Board finds the claim has remained open, or has otherwise been continuously pursued, from February 26, 2008, the date VA received the claim (i.e., within one year of discharge). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400, 3.2500. As discussed, the Veteran continued to seek review of the January 2019 decision, which included revision of the July 2008 decision based on CUE.

With respect to a non-initial rating for bilateral hearing loss, the Board finds the claim has remained open, or has otherwise been continuously pursued, from November 2, 2018, the date that VA received the intent to file. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400, 3.2500.

Scope of Claim

In Clemmons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that when a Veteran makes a claim, he or she is seeking service connection for symptoms regardless of how those symptoms are diagnosed or labeled. The scope of a disability claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and?the other information of record. 23?Vet. App.?1, 4-6.

Evidence raised by the record indicates that the Veteran has been diagnosed with right and left knee degenerative arthritis from October 25, 2007, and December 19, 2007, respectively; within one year of his release from active service. During the same period, the Veteran was seen with complaints of "pain in joint involving lower leg bilateral knee pain, locking and giving out" with onset noted on active duty ("AD"). See April 17, 2008, VA Treatment Record. As pertinent here, objective medical evidence is not required to establish lateral knee instability under Diagnostic Code 5257, so objective medical evidence cannot be categorically found more probative than lay evidence with respect to this Diagnostic Code. See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347, 352-53 (2018). 

The Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claim accordingly.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to initial separate ratings in excess of 10 percent for bilateral knee degenerative arthritis, to include entitlement to staged ratings, from June 26, 2007, is remanded.

2. Entitlement to initial separate 10 percent ratings for bilateral knee instability, to include entitlement to staged ratings, from June 26, 2007, is remanded.

3. Entitlement to a non-initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss from November 2, 2017, is remanded.

On March 27, 2024, VA rejected the Veteran's November 17, 2023, HLR for increased ratings for BHL, bilateral knees, and bilateral knee instability, claiming that (a) "the time limit to file this application has passed" for BHL and (b) the other issues were "ineligible for a Higher-Level Review because they were last processed as a Higher-Level Review, and this cannot be done twice in a row." March 2024 Subsequent Development Letter ("decision letter"). By way of his attorney, the Veteran contends that VA was incorrect on both counts.

The issue for the Board to decide is whether the March 2024 decision letter was proper. 

The Board concludes that it was not. 

The letter rejecting the Veteran's HLR appeal of the ratings assigned for bilateral hearing loss, bilateral knees (generally), and bilateral knee instability, was improper. However, notwithstanding the propriety of the letter (discussed above), the AOJ has yet to address all of the issues raised by the Veteran's valid supplemental claim. 

Accordingly, the foregoing issues are remanded.

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to October 8, 2020, for bilateral knee instability, is remanded.

As the effective date claim is inextricably intertwined with the claim seeking readjudication of the initial evaluation of a bilateral knee disability, it must be remanded as well. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).

5. Entitlement to a TDIU, to include SMC A&A, from June 26, 2007, is remanded.

The Veteran's TDIU claim was raised as part and parcel of an increased rating claim for his bilateral knee disability. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). This similarly includes a claim for entitlement to SMC A&A. See March 2008 VA Forms 21-4138, 8940. As the claim for a TDIU and SMC A&A are inextricably intertwined with the foregoing claim, they must be remanded as well. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).
