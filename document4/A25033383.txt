REMANDED

Entitlement to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance benefits, under Chapter 1606 of Title 10 of the United States Code (Chapter 1606 or Montgomery GI Bill for Selected Reserves (MGIB-SR)), is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The appellant serves in the Army Reserve and has a reserve obligation termination date of March 7, 2030. She had a period of active duty for training (ADT) from June 2023 to September 2023. It is noted that because the appellant does not have active service and is not service-connected for any disability, veteran status is not conferred. See Hill v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 243 (2016).

On the May 14, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant identified a March 19, 2024, decision and the issue as: Denial of Montgomery GI Bill; thus, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act, applies. She elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. 

§§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim.

Entitlement to VA educational assistance benefits, under Chapter 1606, is remanded.

The appellant appeals a decision issued in March 2024 that denied entitlement to MGIB-SR educational assistance benefits. See VA Form 10182 (May 2024).

The Board finds that remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the March 2024 decision on appeal. In this regard, prior to the decision on appeal, the AOJ did not obtain relevant records in the custody of a Federal department or agency. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2).

Under the MGIB-SR, educational assistance benefits are available for members of the Selected Reserve of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, as well as the Army and Air National Guard. 38 C.F.R. § 21.7520. The Department of Defense (DoD) decides who is eligible for the program, and VA makes the payments for the program. 10 U.S.C. § 16132(c); 38 C.F.R. 

§ 21.7540(a). Additionally, the DoD is to send notice of entitlement to Chapter 1606 benefits for an eligible service member pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 16132(c).

Here, prior to the decision on appeal, the record does not include a Chapter 1606 notice from the DoD, or a copy of the appellant's military personnel records. In addition, it is unclear whether the AOJ relied upon outdated records of the appellant's service to determine that she is ineligible for Chapter 1606 educational assistance benefits. In this regard, a March 2024 information report shows that the appellant is not eligible for Chapter 1606 educational assistance benefits because, effective March 8, 2022, she has not completed initial ADT. However, as noted above, the record contains a DD Form 214 indicating that the appellant completed the required ADT on September 9, 2023. 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the March 2024 decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In remanding this matter, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the appellant's assertions. Neither the appellant's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain the appellant's complete military personnel records.

2. Request from the DoD a notice of entitlement to Chapter 1606 benefits for the appellant, pursuant to 

10 U.S.C. § 16132(c). Associate a copy of any negative response received.
