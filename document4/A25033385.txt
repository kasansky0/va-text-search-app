FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At worst, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss has been manifested by level II hearing in the right ear and level II hearing in the left ear.

2. The Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD, to include an unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder, is related to his active-duty service.

3. The Veteran has not had a diagnosis of PTSD at any time during the appeal period.

4. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, it is at least as likely as not his headaches or migraines including migraine variants manifested during active-duty service with a continuity of symptomology since active service.

5. The Veteran has not had a diagnosis of sleep apnea at any time during the appeal period.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from July 2011 to November 2011, August 2013 to August 2014, and February 2021 to July 2021.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision.

The Veteran timely appealed the decision to the Board in a February 2024 Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182) and requested a direct review by a Veterans Law Judge.  Since the Veteran chose direct review, the Board, in adjudicating this matter, may consider evidence associated with the record through the January 2024 rating decision on appeal.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (a), 4.1.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  The analysis in the following decision is therefore undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different ratings may be warranted for different time periods.

Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  A claim will be denied if the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

1. A compensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran requests a compensable evaluation for his bilateral hearing loss.  See February 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is assigned a noncompensable rating, effective from November 14, 2022.  See January 2024 Codesheet.  For the following reasons, the Board finds the criteria for a higher rating have not been satisfied.

Hearing loss is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100.  In evaluating service-connected hearing loss, disability ratings are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are performed.  See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by puretone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz).  38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

To evaluate the degree of disability from defective hearing, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.85, Tables VI and VII, DC 6100.

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the puretone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 dB or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86 (a).

In exceptional situations, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Further, when the average puretone threshold is 30 dB or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 dB or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86 (b).

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran received a VA examination in July 2023.  The examination reflects the Veteran exhibited puretone thresholds, in dB, as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	20	20	25	25	30

LEFT	20	15	25	25	30

The July 2023 VA examination report shows that based on audiometric and speech discrimination testing, the Veteran's right ear hearing loss was manifested by a puretone threshold average of 25 dB and a speech discrimination score of 88 percent.  His left ear hearing loss was manifested by a puretone threshold average of 24 dB and a speech discrimination score of 84 percent.

Applying these values for the right ear to Table VI, the puretone threshold average of 25 dB and the speech recognition score of 88 percent together yield a designation of Level II for the right ear.  The puretone threshold average of 24 dB and the speech recognition score of 84 percent yield a designation of Level II for the left ear.  The point where designations II and II intersect in Table VII yields a 0-percent rating.  Id.

The Board notes the alternative criteria as highlighted above under 38 C.F.R.         § 4.86 do not apply in this case for the either ear.

The functional effects of hearing loss on the Veteran's daily life activities and occupational functioning have been taken into consideration by VA.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.10; Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447, 455-56 (2007).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran believes his hearing acuity is worse than has been evaluated.  However, far more probative of the degree of the disability are the results of testing prepared by a skilled professional as the schedular criteria are predicated on audiological findings rather than subjective reports of severity of hearing loss.  In essence, lay statements are of limited probative value.  As a layperson, the Veteran is competent to report difficulty with his hearing; however, he is not competent to assign particular speech recognition scores or puretone decibel readings to his current acuity problems.  As indicated above, ratings of hearing loss disability involve mechanical application of the rating criteria to the findings on official audiometry.  Lendenmann, 3 Vet. App. at 345.

The Board sincerely empathizes with the Veteran and acknowledges he has hearing loss that causes him inconveniences and challenges.  However, when a claimant's hearing loss results in an inability to hear or understand speech or to hear other sounds in various contexts, those effects are contemplated by the schedular rating criteria.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369 (2017).

Accordingly, for the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to as whether a higher evaluation is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against such finding.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107 (b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch, supra.

Service Connection

Generally, service connection will be awarded when a veteran has a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R.        § 3.303 (d).

To establish service connection on a direct basis, the evidence must show: (1) a current disability; (2) an incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a link between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

For the chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a), including psychoses, alternatively, service connection may be established with evidence of chronicity of the disease during service or during a presumptive period following service separation, or for conditions noted during service (or in a presumptive period) but not shown to be chronic at the time, by showing a continuity of symptomatology after service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).  When chronicity or continuity is established, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, no matter how remote in time from the period of service, will be service connected unless clearly attributable to causes unrelated to service (i.e., "intercurrent" causes).  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f).

If the evidence for and against a claim is in equipoise, the claim will be granted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  A claim will be denied if the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch, supra.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

2. Service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include an unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder, is granted.

The Veteran contends service connection is warranted for PTSD.  See February 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

Here, all three elements to establish service connection have been satisfied as to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include an unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (a), Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d at 1166-67.  First, as concerning the requisite current diagnosis, the Board observes the January 2024 rating decision on appeal notes a favorable finding of a current diagnosis for an unspecified trauma and stressor-related disorder.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding absent clear and unmistakable error, which is not demonstrated here.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

As to an in-service event, the Veteran's military records show the Veteran served in Afghanistan and received the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Campaign Star.  Therefore, an in-service stressor is conceded.

The Veteran is also competent to attest to such matters he has experienced or to the onset of his symptomatology, and his statements are considered evidence in support of the claim.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307-308 (2007).

Finally, as to the third element, that of a nexus between the Veteran's currently diagnosed psychiatric disorder and his in-service stressors, a VA psychologist in December 2023 found the Veteran meets the current diagnosis for an unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder, which is at least as likely as not a result of his active service or extensive exposure to incoming rocket and mortar attacks, which injured servicemembers.

Accordingly, given the above, the Board finds service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition is warranted.  Notably, there is no adequate negative opinion of record negating that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric condition is unrelated to the in-service events of record.  As such, the Board finds a nexus is established, and service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition is granted.

3. Service connection for PTSD is denied.

The Veteran asserts he experiences PTSD.  See February 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  The Board finds the weight of the competent and credible evidence establishes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with the provisions of DSM 5.

The probative medical evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a).  There is no medical evidence in the file showing a diagnosis of PTSD.  A December 2023 VA examination notes after an examination of the Veteran, his symptoms do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under DSM 5.  Instead, the Veteran has been diagnosed with an unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder under DSM 5 for which he is now service connected.  See December 2023 Initial Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

A review of the record contains no actual diagnosis of PTSD under the DSM 5 as defined by VA regulations.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304 (f), 4.125 (a).  Although the Veteran is competent to report what he observes and how he feels, he is not competent to attribute his symptoms to a specific mental diagnosis such as PTSD.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has also explicitly stated that PTSD is not capable of a lay diagnosis.  Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence...is competent and sufficient to identify").  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence, specifically the December 2023 VA examination.  See also January 2024 Addendum VA Nexus Opinion

Accordingly, since the probative evidence of record does not show the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD, the claim must be denied.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

4. Service connection for headaches or migraines including migraine variants is granted.

The Veteran contends service connection is warranted for migraines.  See February 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  Concerning the requisite current diagnosis, the Board observes the January 2024 rating decision on appeal notes a favorable finding of a current diagnosis for a diagnosis of migraines with migraine variants.  Further, the January 2024 rating decision notes favorable findings that the Veteran was exposed to burn pit toxins, harmful air particulates, and MOS-related toxins in addition to having participated in a toxic exposure risk activity during active service in the Southwest theaters of operation and had an MOS that exposed him to dust, fumes, solvents, and other harmful particulates.  As a result, an in-service event is also established.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings absent clear and unmistakable error, which is not demonstrated here.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

In this case, for the reasons stated below, the Board finds, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, it is at least as likely as not his headaches or migraines including migraine variants manifested during active-duty service with continuity of symptomology since active service.

Regarding this, VA received a negative etiological opinion for direct service connection in November 2023.  The examiner concludes the Veteran's migraines are less likely than not caused by the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activities.  For their rationale, the examiner found no medical or scientific evidence available that provides an indication of a relationship between the development of migraines and the TERAs.

The Board finds the examiner's rationale is inadequate because the examiner merely states there is no relationship between the Veteran's migraines and his in-service TERAs without explaining why there is no relationship between the two.  This renders the rationale conclusory and insufficient.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).

However, the Board notes the November 2023 Headaches Disability Benefits Questionnaire notes the Veteran reported a date of onset in 2013 after deployment.  In this case, the Veteran is competent to describe in-service events and observable symptomology in the form of migraines or headaches.  See Jandreau, supra.  As such, the Board, in resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, finds it is at least as likely as not his headaches or migraines including migraine variants manifested during active-duty service with continuity of symptomology since active-duty service.

Thus, the Board finds it is approximately at least as likely as not the Veteran's headaches or migraines including migraine variants manifested during active-duty service with continuity of symptomology since discharge.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338-39.  Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for headaches or migraines including migraine variants is granted.

5. Service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

The Veteran contends service connection is warranted for sleep apnea.  See February 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

As to this, an October 2023 sleep study is negative for sleep apnea.  Instead, during a VA psychiatric examination in December 2023, the Veteran's symptoms were found to include chronic sleep impairment and sleep disturbance to include a difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep.

In this case, the weight of the evidence reflects any history of sleep impairment represents a manifestation or symptom of the Veteran's now service-connected psychiatric condition, and his sleep disturbance is now compensated as part of his disability evaluation for his now service-connected psychiatric condition.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328 (1997) (holding that the VA's and the Court's interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary and therefore the decision based on that interpretation must be affirmed); see also Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.  So, without competent evidence of a current sleep disorder that is separate and distinct from the symptoms associated with the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability, service connection cannot be awarded.  Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143-44 (1992).

After weighing all the evidence, the Board finds service connection for sleep apnea is unwarranted as an October 2023 sleep study did not confirm a diagnosis of sleep apnea.  See also November 2023 Sleep Apnea Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

The evidence is persuasively against the claim, and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, supra.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for a back condition is remanded.

2. Service connection for a right knee condition is remanded.

3. Service connection for a left knee condition is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for back and bilateral knee conditions.  See February 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  

The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for this claim.  In determining whether the duty to assist requires that a VA medical examination be provided or medical opinion obtained with respect to a veteran's claim for benefits, four factors are for consideration: (1) competent evidence of a current disability or recurrent symptoms; (2) establishment of an in-service event, injury, or disease; (3) indication that the current disability may be associated with an in-service event; and (4) sufficient competent medical evidence to decide the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-85 (2006).

Here, based on the Veteran's documented combat service, the Board finds the lack of VA examinations constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  38 C.F.R.       § 20.802 (a).  Thus, a remand is necessary to afford the Veteran the requisite VA examinations consistent with the remand directives below.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ should schedule the Veteran for VA examinations and opinions to determine the nature and etiology of any back or bilateral knee disabilities.  All studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.

The appropriate Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) should be filled out.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file, including the Veteran's service treatment records, post-service medical records, and statements.

It should be noted the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he had first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.

Following a review of the record, to include the Veteran's lay statements as well as any other evidence that may be added to the record concerning onset and recurrence of symptomatology, the examiner should provide an opinion as to the following:

Is it approximately at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) the Veteran's disability was either incurred in or otherwise related to the Veteran's military service to include wear and tear due to military activities and any combat service?

In offering any opinion, the examiner must consider the full record, to include the Veteran's lay statements.  The opinions must reflect consideration of the Veteran's reports as to his history and symptomatology.

If an opinion cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, it must be clear whether this is due to a lack of knowledge among the medical community at large or insufficient knowledge of the specific examiner.  The examiner must explain whether there is any potentially available information that, if obtained, would allow for a non-speculative opinion to be provided.

The examiner must provide a comprehensive report that includes a complete rationale for all opinions and conclusions reached.
