DOCKET NO. 220311-227543
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of reduction of right knee limitation of extension is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On October 2, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran, through his authorized representative, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty with the United States Army from June 1990 to December 2012.  He had service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War and is a recipient of the Bronze Star Medal, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the Combat Action Badge, among other decorations and awards.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in January 2022.

In the March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  However, in October 2024, the Veteran, through his representative, submitted a written statement requesting to withdraw his appeal.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  Here, the Veteran's withdrawal, submitted by his authorized representative, was in writing and included his name, applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
