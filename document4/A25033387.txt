FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On February 1, 1977, the Veteran filed a claim seeking compensation for a left knee disability and back disability.  An October 1977 rating decision denied service connection for a left knee disability and awarded a noncompensable rating for a back disability, and the Veteran was notified of this decision on November 11, 1977.  The Veteran did not file a timely appeal of the October 1977 rating decision, and new and material evidence was not actually or constructively received within one year of the date of notification.

2. The Veteran's filed an increased rating claim on November 13, 2008, which encompassed a claim of entitlement to service connection for left knee strain and left hip strain.  

3. The Veteran's left knee strain associated with left ankle strain manifested not later than November 13, 2008.

4. The Veteran's left hip strain associated with left ankle strain manifested not later than November 13, 2008.

5. In a March 9, 2009, statement received on March 13, 2009, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim for his back disability.  An August 2012 rating decision awarded, in relevant part, an increased 40 percent rating for a back disability effective March 9, 2009.  New and material evidence was actually received in February 2013.  The claim was readjudicated in December 2013, and new and material evidence was actually received in October 2014.  The claim was readjudicated in December 2014, and in February 2015 the Veteran filed a timely Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  

6. The Veteran's bladder incontinence associated with a back disability manifested not later than March 9, 2009.

7. The Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with a back disability manifested not later than March 9, 2009.

8. The Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with a back disability manifested on October 11, 2019, but not earlier.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1975 to December 1976.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from October 2020 and November 2020 rating decisions by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In May 2021, the Veteran filed a timely NOD and elected the Board Hearing docket.

In December 2024, the Veteran testified at a virtual hearing before the undersigned.  Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record when the Veteran was notified of the AOJ decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or her representative at or within 90 days of the Board hearing.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and before the Board hearing was held, or evidence submitted more than 90 days after the Board hearing.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

The Veteran included the issues of pes planus, fibromyalgia, and a toe disability with osteopenia in her NOD.  At the hearing, the Board and the Veteran clarified that these issues were not presently before the Board, as no AOJ decision was issued adjudicating those issues within one year prior to the Veteran filing her NOD.  See December 2024 Hearing Transcript at 2.  Additionally, with respect to the appeals of the awards of service connection for the Veteran's left knee, left lower extremity radiculopathy, right lower extremity radiculopathy, and bladder incontinence, the Board and the Veteran clarified that she was only seeking an earlier effective date of service connection, but not a higher rating.  See id. at 19, 24-26.  With respect to the award of service connection for a left hip disability, the Veteran clarified that the appeal included both entitlement to an earlier effective date of service connection and an increased initial rating.  See id. at 25-26.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion that she requires aid and attendance.  See, e.g., May 2020 VA Form 21-2680.  As the Veteran does not assert that this requirement is due to her left hip disability, this issue is not within the scope of this appeal.  

The evidence shows that the Veteran's left hip disability contributes to her inability to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment.  See, e.g., February 2020 TDIU Opinion; April 2021 Board Decision at 17.  Although the April 2021 Board decision denied entitlement to a TDIU prior to March 15, 2019, the present decision awards earlier effective dates of service connection for the Veteran's left knee strain, left hip strain, bladder incontinence, and left and right lower extremity radiculopathy.  Thus, the Board has added the issue of entitlement to a TDIU prior to March 15, 2019, for appellate consideration as part and parcel of the increased initial rating claim on appeal.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009); Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394 (2024).

The Veteran's Arguments

In the Veteran's written submissions and her testimony at the Board hearing, she argues that she is entitled to a total rating effective from her original claim filed in 1977, or in the alternative from her 2008 date of claim.  See, e.g., December 2024 Hearing Transcript at 18; December 2020 Statement in Support of Claim; see also January 2021 VA Form 20-0995.  As discussed below, the October 1977 rating decision that adjudicated the Veteran's original compensation claim was not appealed and that decision is final.  Thus, that decision cannot be revised unless the Veteran establishes that it was the product of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  If the Veteran believes that the October 1977 rating decision was the product of CUE, she may wish to consult with her representative regarding how to proceed.

While the Board cannot award an increased rating retroactive to 1977, the record does reflect that service connection for the Veteran's left hip disability and left knee disability were awarded as an aspect of the Veteran's appeal as to entitlement to an increased initial rating for a left ankle disability.  See September 2019 Board Remand at 2; November 2020 Rating Decision.  Thus, the applicable date of claim for the Veteran's left hip and left knee disabilities is November 13, 2008. 

Moreover, this appeal arises from the Veteran's appeal of the initial award of service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy and bladder incontinence.  See October 2020 Rating Decision.  These disabilities are associated with her back disability, and VA's rating schedule provides that when rating diseases and injuries of the spine, objective neurologic impairments associated with the spine are to be rated as separately.  As discussed below, the evidence shows that the Veteran's March 9, 2009 claim seeking an increased rating for her back disability has remained pending, and thus that is the applicable date of claim.

Law and Regulations for Earlier Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection shall be the later of the date of receipt of the application or the date that the entitlement to the benefit arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For claims seeking an increased rating for a disability that is already service connected, the Board may award an increased rating from the date of a factually ascertainable increase in disability, if that factually ascertainable increase was within one year of the date of receipt of an increased rating claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

VA's modernized appeals system governs appeals where an original decision was issued on or after February 19, 2019.  VA's legacy appeals system was the appeals system in place prior to the effective date of the modernized system.  While this appeal is governed by VA's modernized appeals system, the procedures governing VA's legacy appeals system are relevant in determining the finality of decisions issued prior to February 19, 2019.  

Under VA's legacy appeals system, a decision is final unless it is timely appealed or unless new and material evidence is received within the time to appeal the decision.  If new and material evidence is actually or constructively received within the time to appeal a decision, then that evidence will be considered in connection with the pending claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  A veteran's VA treatment records are considered constructively received as of the date that they are generated.  See Lang. v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision makers.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).  Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with the previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.  Id.

After an initial decision is issued in VA's legacy system, an appellant typically has one year to file an NOD.  Once an appellant files a timely NOD, VA will issue an SOC, and an appellant can then perfect an appeal by filing a timely substantive appeal.  An appellant typically must file a substantive appeal within 60 days from the date that an SOC is issued, or one year from the date of notification of the decision on appeal, whichever is later.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (as in effect prior to February 19, 2019).  If a timely appeal is not initiated, or if an appellant does not perfect an appeal, then the initial decision becomes final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (as in effect prior to February 19, 2019).

On March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary of VA, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sep. 25, 2014).  Current VA regulations require a NOD to be filed on VA's prescribed form.  Prior to March 24, 2015, VA did not require the use of a standardized form to file an NOD.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201 (2012) (NOD does not require special wording); Palmer v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 434, 437 (2007) ("VA has always been, and will continue to be, liberal in determining what constitutes a Notice of Disagreement").

Prior to March 24, 2015, VA allowed for the filing of informal claims without any particular format or requirements aside from (1) an intent to apply for benefits; (2) an identification of the benefits sought; and (3) a communication in writing.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, an application for a formal claim would be sent to the claimant, and if that application was completed within one year of provision to the claimant the date of the informal claim would be used as the date of claim.  A formal claim filed prior to March 24, 2015 was required to identify, at least at a high level of generality, the current condition upon which the Veteran's claim for benefits is based.  See Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran has a long and complex claims history.  The Board will discuss this history below and apply the law to the facts in a general sense, and then will proceed to discuss how this impacts each issue on appeal.

The Veteran's 1977 Claim

The Veteran separated from active duty on December 15, 1976.  In February 1977, VA received her original claim seeking compensation for an injured left foot, injured left knee, flat feet, and back problem.  In November 1977, she was notified of an October 1977 rating decision that awarded service connection for pes planus, a left foot scar status-post surgery, and mid-back strain.  That decision assigned a noncompensable (zero percent) rating effective from December 16, 1976.  The October 1977 rating decision also denied service connection for a left knee disability, noting that no disability was found on examination. 

The Veteran did not appeal the October 1977 rating decision, and new and material evidence was not actually or constructively received within one year of the date the Veteran was notified of the decision.  In this regard, the Board acknowledges that the AOJ was unable to locate the Veteran's VA treatment records from 1977 to 1988.  See, e.g., April 2015 Report of General Information (formal finding of unavailability of records).  However, the Veteran has stated that she ceased receiving VA treatment prior to the issuance of the October 1977 rating decision.  See, e.g., September 1977 Statement in Support of Claim (stating that she had completed her VA appointments); December 2024 Hearing Transcript at 8 (testifying that prior to 2008, she last went to the VA hospital in October 1977 for x-rays).  As the Veteran did not file a timely appeal of the October 1977 rating decision, and as new and material evidence was not actually or constructively received within one year of the date she was notified of that decision, the October 1977 rating decision is final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105 ; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 20.1103; Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 252 (2010).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that she was not notified of the October 1977 rating decision, as she resided at that address until 1979 and during that time did not receive any anything from VA.  See December 2024 Board Hearing Transcript at 20.  The presumption of regularity has the effect of presuming that VA fulfilled its duties.  See Romero v. Tran,33 Vet. App. 252 (2021).  Here, the relevant duties include the duty to notify the Veteran of the October 1977 rating decision.  

The existence of a legal duty is enough for the presumption of regularity to attach.  Romero, 33 Vet. App. at 254.  Once the presumption attaches, the next question is whether there is clear evidence to rebut the presumption, and if there is clear evidence of irregularity then the presumption is rebutted and the burden shifts to the VA to prove that it did its duty in this case.  Id. at 261.  Though a statement of nonreceipt of nonreceipt standing alone is not enough to rebut the presumption, a statement of nonreceipt coupled with other evidence can be.  Id.  Other evidence can include, for example, "clear evidence to the effect that VA's 'regular' mailing practices are not regular or that they were not followed.'"  Id. (quoting Ashley v. Derwinski (Ashley II), 2 Vet. App. 307, 309 (1992).

Here, the presumption of regularity is not rebutted, and the claims file shows that the Veteran responded to other notices that VA mailed her at about the same time.  In this regard, the evidence in the claims file shows that on November 11, 1977, notice of the October 1977 rating decision was mailed to the Veteran's address of record, as the notice letter in the claims file bears a date stamp and the Veteran's address.  See November 1977 Notification Letter.  Moreover, notice of the October 1977 rating decision was mailed to the same address as notice of the July 1977 VA examination, which the Veteran attended.  See July 1977 VA Examination Letter; July 1977 VA Examination Report.  Additionally, in July 1977 the Veteran was mailed notice that her educational assistance allowance had been discontinued, and in September 1977 she responded a statement explaining why she withdrew from classes.  See July 1977 Notification Letter; September 1977 Statement in Support of Claim.  This contemporaneous evidence that the Veteran received and responded to VA notices is more probative than the Veteran's statement at the December 2024 Board hearing that she did not receive notice of the October 1977 rating decision.  Thus, the presumption of administrative regularity is not rebutted.

The Veteran's Claims in 2008 and Thereafter

On November 13, 2008, the Veteran filed a claim seeking an increased rating for her left foot disability.  See November 2008 Statement in Support of Claim.  The Board subsequently determined that this claim included a claim of entitlement to service connection for a left ankle disability, notwithstanding that the AOJ did not adjudicate service connection for a left ankle disability until December 2014.  See September 2018 Board Decision and Remand.  Moreover, on March 9, 2009, the Veteran filed a claim seeking, in relevant part, an increased rating for her back disability.  The November 2008 and March 2009 claims were denied by a May 2009 rating decision, and the Veteran filed a timely NOD.  

In August 2012, the AOJ issued a rating decision that awarded a 40 percent rating for a back disability effective March 9, 2009, and a 10 percent rating for a left foot scar effective June 4, 2009.  The AOJ also issued an SOC addressing the Veteran's appeal of the May 2009 rating decision, although as discussed below, the Veteran was not notified of this SOC until February 2013.  

In December 2012, the Veteran attempted to file an NOD with the August 2012 rating decision, arguing (among other things) that she was entitled to higher ratings for her left foot, left ankle, and back.  See December 2012 Statement in Support of Claim.  The Veteran subsequently argued that she wanted her 50 percent combined disability evaluation increased to 100 percent.  See January 2013 Congressionals.  

On February 7, 2013, the AOJ mailed the Veteran notice of its determination that she had not been notified of the August 2012 SOC.  See February 2013 Notification Letter.  The AOJ stated that as the evidence showed that the Veteran had not received the SOC, VA was "not considering [her] recent correspondence as a notice of disagreement or substantive appeal because you have not received the Statement of the Case for these issues."  Id.  The AOJ notified the Veteran that she had 60 days from February 7, 2013, to submit a substantive appeal.  Id.

On February 28, 2013, VA received medical records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) related to the Veteran's claim for SSA disability benefits.  These records were relevant to the Veteran's back disability, including urinary incontinence and a neurological disability in the left lower extremity.  See, e.g., October 13, 2005 Private Treatment Note; December 18, 2005 Private Treatment Record; April 14, 2007 Internal Medicine Examination Report; March 20, 2008 Private Treatment Note.  Moreover, these records were received within one year of the August 2012 rating decision and within the time to perfect an appeal of the August 2012 SOC.  However, the AOJ did not issue a Supplemental SOC, as required by the VA regulations that were then in effect.  See 38 C.F.R. ?§§ 19.31, 19.37.  Thus, as the AOJ did not readjudicate the claim, the August 2012 rating decision never became final.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

The Board acknowledges that the August 2012 rating decision was generated as a partial grant of benefits after the Veteran had filed an NOD with the May 2009 rating decision.  However, as discussed below, the Veteran's appeal of the May 2009 rating decision was closed due to failure to file a timely substantive appeal and the AOJ did not consider whether the SSA records were new and material evidence until December 2013.  

On April 23, 2013, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 9.  The AOJ initially requested that the Veteran's representative complete a VA Form 646 in support of the Veteran's appeal.  See September 2013 VA Form 646.  However, on December 18, 2013, VA notified the Veteran that her VA Form 9 was untimely.  See December 2013 Notification Letter.  

In December 2013, the AOJ issued a rating decision that continued the Veteran's 40 percent rating for a back disability and her 10 percent rating for a left foot scar and denied entitlement to a TDIU.  However, this decision did not become final, as new and material evidence was received within one year.  See May 2014 Feet Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ); October 2014 Back DBQ.  

In December 2014, the AOJ issued a rating decision that in relevant part denied a rating in excess of 40 percent for a back disability, denied service connection for left knee arthritis, and denied service connection for left ankle sprain.  

In February 2015, the Veteran submitted a printout from VA's e-Benefits website showing that the Board had issued a decision on December 18, 2013, and that her appeal was pending as of December 23, 2013.  See VA Memorandum.  The Veteran attached a note inquiring as to the status of her appeal, including her back and left ankle disabilities.  Id.  VA subsequently provided the Veteran additional notice that her April 2013 VA form 9 was untimely.  See December 2015 Correspondence.

Here, VA's actions had misled the Veteran into believing that her appeal as to her back disability had remained pending, as in February 2015 VA's e-Benefits system erroneously informed her that this appeal was pending notwithstanding the AOJ's determination that her appeal was untimely.  Moreover, after the Veteran inquired as to the status of her appeal in February 2015, VA did not send her a response until December 8, 2015, less than two weeks before the expiration of the time to appeal the December 2014 rating decision.  Although the Veteran did not protest VA's determinations that her VA Form 9 was untimely, it is clear that she desired to continue her appeal.  The Board liberally construes the Veteran's February 2015 inquiry as to the status of her appeal as a timely NOD as to the December 2014 rating decision, as her inquiry unambiguously indicates her despite to contest the denial of a higher rating for her back disability.  Critically, the laws and regulations in effect in February 2015 did not require the use of a prescribed form.

In May 2015, the AOJ awarded service connection for left ankle strain and awarded an initial 10 percent rating effective December 14, 2012.  The Veteran perfected an appeal of this decision.  In September 2018, the Board granted an effective date of November 13, 2008, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for a left ankle disability.  The Board explained that the Veteran's November 2008 claim encompassed this disability, and the Veteran had continuously prosecuted this claim.  

In September 2019, the Board remanded the issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for a left ankle disability and entitlement to a TDIU.  The Board noted that in March 2019 correspondence, the Veteran's treating physician had opined that the Veteran's left ankle problems had caused the Veteran back pain, hip pain, and knee pain, and had aggravated the Veteran's shoulder.  See September 2019 Board Remand at 2.  The Board explained that additional development was necessary, as if these other joint complaints were related to her left ankle disability, then the Veteran's disability picture would not be contemplated by the rating schedule.  See id.

In October 2020, the AOJ issued a rating decision awarding service connection for bladder incontinence and right and left lower extremity radiculopathy associated with the Veteran's back disability.  The AOJ explained that this was an adjudication of a new claim that the Veteran had filed in February 2020.

In November 2020, the AOJ issued a rating decision that awarded service connection for left knee strain, as well as limitation of extension, flexion, and other impairments of the hip caused by left hip strain.  The AOJ explained that this adjudication was related to the September 2019 Board Remand.  

In April 2021, the Board issued a decision adjudicating the Veteran's appeal of the May 2015 rating decision.  The Board denied an increased initial rating for a left ankle disability; denied a TDIU prior to March 15, 2019; granted a TDIU from March 15, 2019, to May 20, 2020; and thereafter dismissed the issue of entitlement to a TDIU as moot.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and it is final.

1. Entitlement to an effective date of November 13, 2008, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for left knee strain is granted.

The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to service connection for a left knee disability effective from December 16, 1976, the day after separation from service, or in the alternative from November 13, 2008.  The Veteran is currently in receipt of service connection for a left knee disability effective from February 24, 2020.  See November 2020 Rating Decision.  

As noted above, the September 2019 Board Decision and Remand raised the issue of compensation for a left knee disability as part of the initial rating for the Veteran's left ankle disability.  Thus, the applicable date of claim is November 13, 2008, the effective date of service connection for the Veteran's left ankle disability, and this issue turns on when entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability arose.  

A July 1977 VA examination report notes the Veteran's report of pain and weakness in the left knee, with the knee giving out if she gets up too quickly.  Range of motion testing showed full range of motion bilaterally.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with residuals, left knee strain, chronic.  

A December 20, 2005 Private Treatment Note reflects that the Veteran fell at a store and was now experiencing left ankle, leg, and knee pain, and she believed that she had reinjured all of her old injuries.  The Veteran was assessed as having pain due to strain or sprain.  

An April 14, 2007 Internal Medicine Examination noted full range of motion in the knees bilaterally, with the Veteran complaining of pain in her hips on examination.  

In 2014, the Veteran was diagnosed with knee arthritis by x-ray examination.  See October 2014 Knee DBQ at 6-7.

Here, it is as likely as not that the Veteran's left knee disability had manifested as of November 13, 2008.  In this regard, while the Veteran's left knee arthritis was not diagnosed until 2014, the evidence of record shows complaints of left knee pain and weakness prior to 2008 due to strain, and she had previously been diagnosed with chronic residuals of knee strain.  The Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt in this regard and finds that this disability had manifested as of November 13, 2008.

The Board acknowledges that service connection for the Veteran's left knee strain was premised on aggravation of that disability by the Veteran's left ankle disability.  See November 2020 Rating Decision at 3.  However, the evidence also supports a direct link between the Veteran's left ankle disability and her left knee strain.  See, e.g., February 2020 Proximate Cause Knee Opinion.  The Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt in this regard.

The Board cannot award an effective date of service connection earlier than November 13, 2008.  In this regard, while there is evidence showing that the Veteran's left knee disability had manifested prior to November 13, 2008, the October 1977 rating decision denied service connection for a left knee disability on the basis that no disability was found at the VA examination.  As explained above, that decision is final, and thus the Board cannot award benefits based on the Veteran's February 1977 claim.  Accordingly, the earliest applicable date of claim is November 13, 2008, and that is the earliest date that service connection can be granted in the absence of a showing of CUE.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of November 13, 2008, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for left hip strain is granted.

The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to service connection for a left hip disability effective from December 16, 1976, the day after separation from service, or in the alternative from November 13, 2008.  The Veteran is in receipt of service connection for left hip strain effective from February 24, 2020.  See November 2020 Rating Decision. 

As noted above, the September 2019 Board Decision and Remand raised the issue of compensation for a left hip disability as part of the initial rating for the Veteran's left ankle disability.  Thus, the applicable date of claim is November 13, 2008, the effective date of service connection for the Veteran's left ankle disability, and this issue turns on when entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability arose.  

An April 14, 2007 Internal Medicine Examination report notes that the Veteran's range of motion in the hip joints was limited by pain.  

A June 2009 VA examination report notes the Veteran's report that narcotic pain medication seemed to help everything, including her hip pain.  

Here, the evidence shows the presence of functional impairment due to left hip pain prior to and soon after the November 13, 2008, date of claim.  The Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt in this regard and finds that a left hip disability had manifested by November 13, 2008.  

The Board acknowledges that service connection for the Veteran's left hip strain was premised on aggravation of that disability by the Veteran's left ankle disability.  However, as with the Veteran's left knee, the evidence also supports a direct link between the Veteran's left ankle disability and her left hip disability.  See, e.g., February 2020 Proximate Cause Hip Opinion.  Thus, it is as likely as not that entitlement to service connection for left hip strain arose by November 13, 2008.

The Board cannot award an effective date of service connection earlier than November 13, 2008.  In this regard, the Board acknowledges that there is evidence that a left hip disability had manifested prior to November 13, 2008.  However, prior to November 13, 2008, the Veteran did not file a claim for a left hip disability, or a claim that reasonably encompasses a claim for a left hip disability.  In this regard, the Veteran's 1977 claim did not explicitly include or reasonably encompass a claim for a left hip disability.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that her hip claim was filed earlier than 2020, as an earlier claim addressed the entire left side of her body.  See December 2024 Hearing Transcript at 15.  The Board agrees with this statement to the extent that the Board previously determined that the Veteran's November 2008 claim encompassed more than just her left ankle disability.  However, to the extent that the Veteran is arguing that her 1977 claim also included a left hip disability, the evidence shows that the 1977 claim did not reasonably encompass a left hip disability.  In this regard, a formal claim for benefits is required to identify, at least at a high level of generality, the condition upon which a claim for benefits is based.  See Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  Here, there is nothing in the Veteran's February 1977 claim identifying her left hip as distinct from her claim for compensation for a back problem and injured left knee, even at a high level of generality.  To the extent that a claim for a left hip disability was encompassed within the claims for a left knee disability and back disability, this claim was implicitly denied by the October 1977 rating decision.

There are four factors that the Board should consider when determining whether a claim was implicitly denied.  The Board should consider (1) the specificity or relatedness of the claims involved; (2) the specificity of the adjudication (whether the decision at issue adjudicated the pending claim using language that could reasonably be inferred as denying the pending claim; (3) the timing of the claims involved; and (4) whether the claimant was represented at the time.  Cogburn v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 205, 212-13 (2010) (Cogburn I).  

Here, any claim for a left hip disability would be based on the February 1977 claim.  The October 1977 rating decision adjudicated that claim in full by denying service connection for a left knee disability and granting service connection for a back disability and assigning an initial noncompensable rating.  Thus, the first two factors weigh in favor of finding that any claim was implicitly denied.  In this regard, the AOJ adjudicated the claims using essentially the same language used by the Veteran.  Moreover, the claim for a left hip disability would have arisen from the same submission as the claims for a back problem and left knee injury adjudicated in the October 1977 rating decision, and thus the third factor also weighs in favor of implicit denial.  The fourth factor weighs in favor of the Veteran, as at the time she was represented by a Veteran Service Organization, not an attorney.  

The balance of the factors weighs substantially in favor of finding that any claim for a left hip disability was implicitly denied by the October 1977 rating decision.  The claim was adjudicated using essentially the same language that the Veteran used on her claim form and clearly was addressing the Veteran's February 1977 original compensation claim.  Although the Veteran was not represented by an attorney, any reasonable individual would believe that the February 1977 had been adjudicated in full.  

Accordingly, the earliest applicable date of claim is November 13, 2008, and that is the earliest date that service connection can be granted.

3. Entitlement to an effective date of March 9, 2009, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for bladder incontinence is granted.

The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to service connection for bladder incontinence effective from December 16, 1976, the day after separation from service, or in the alternative from November 13, 2008.  The Veteran is in receipt of service connection for bladder incontinence associated with her back disability effective from January 16, 2020.  

As discussed above, the Veteran's March 9, 2009 claim seeking an increased rating for her back disability was never subject to a final denial.  Thus, as the Veteran's bladder incontinence was awarded as secondary to the Veteran's back disability and as VA rating criteria for the spine direct adjudicators to rate objective neurologic abnormalities separately, the applicable date of claim for bladder incontinence is March 9, 2009.  In this regard, the Veteran timely appealed the initial award of service connection for bladder incontinence.  See De Hart v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 371 (2023).  Accordingly, this appeal turns on the date that the Veteran's bladder incontinence associated with her back disability manifested.

An October 13, 2005 Private Treatment Note reflects the Veteran's reports of urine accidents since a motor vehicle accident.  

An April 14, 2007 Internal Medicine Examination notes the Veteran's report of stress incontinence.  

The October 2020 Urinary Tract DBQ reflects that the Veteran was diagnosed with bladder incontinence in 2004 that had stayed the same.  That examiner subsequently opined that the Veteran had neurogenic urinary incontinence as likely as not secondary to her back condition.  See October 2020 Bladder Opinion.  The AOJ subsequently awarded service connection based on this opinion.  See October 2020 Rating Decision.

Here, the AOJ has made a favorable finding that the Veteran's bladder incontinence is proximately due to her back disability, and that finding is not clearly erroneous.  Moreover, the evidence shows that this bladder incontinence had manifested by March 9, 2009, the date of claim.  Accordingly, an effective date of March 9, 2009, for the award of service connection for bladder incontinence is warranted.  

The Veteran is not entitled to an effective date of service connection for bladder incontinence prior to March 9, 2009.  In this regard, the Board acknowledges that there is evidence that the Veteran's bladder incontinence had manifested prior to March 9, 2009.  However, an October 1977 rating decision awarded a noncompensable rating for a back disability, and that decision is final.  Thus, the Board cannot award benefits based on the Veteran's February 1977 claim.  Accordingly, the earliest applicable date of claim is March 9, 2009, and that is the earliest date that service connection can be granted.

4. Entitlement to an effective date of March 9, 2009, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve, is granted.

5. Entitlement to an effective date of October 11, 2019, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve, is granted. 

The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy from December 16, 1976, the day after separation from service, or in the alternative from November 13, 2008.  The Veteran is in receipt of service connection for left and right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy associated with her back disability effective from May 21, 2020.  

As discussed above, the evidence shows that the Veteran's March 9, 2009 claim seeking an increased rating for her back disability was never subject to a final denial.  Thus, as the Veteran's left and right lower extremity radiculopathy were awarded as secondary to the Veteran's back disability and as the rating criteria for the back direct VA to rate objective neurologic abnormalities, the applicable date of claim for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy is March 9, 2009.  In this regard, the Veteran timely appealed the initial award of service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy.  See De Hart, supra.  Accordingly, this appeal turns on the date that the Veteran's left and right lower extremity radiculopathy associated with her back disability manifested.

A December 18, 2005 Private Treatment Note reflects the Veteran's reports of pain and burning in her left leg following a fall.  Although the Veteran was concerned that it might be a deep vein thrombosis, her provider told her that this was unlikely and noted that this was likely neuropathic pain.  

A March 20, 2008 Private Treatment Note reflected the Veteran's report of falling about once a month when her left leg does not support her, with muscle spasms in her left leg.  

The June 2009 VA examination report notes the Veteran's report of pain radiating into the left anterior hip, down the left leg, and into the toes.  

An October 11, 2019 Private Treatment Note reflects buttock pain, left greater than right.  

An October 12, 2019 letter from Dr. C.K. reflects the presence of radicular symptoms.  

An October 2020 Peripheral Nerves DBQ reflects a diagnosis of radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities, with a date of diagnosis of October 24, 2020.  

Here, the evidence shows the presence of chronic left lower extremity pain assessed as being of neurological origin present as early as 2005.  While no examiner has opined that this is proximately due to the Veteran's back disability, the Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt in this regard.  Thus, the Veteran is entitled to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy effective from March 9, 2009, the date of claim for an increased rating for her back disability.  

The Board acknowledges that the October 2014 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's left side weakness was related to her stroke in 2013.  See October 2014 Back DBQ (Remarks).  However, that examiner noted that although the Veteran told him that her left knee had given out prior to her stroke, he did not see documentation confirming this in the medical record.  Id.  As noted above, the evidence shows that the Veteran had left side symptoms prior to her stroke in 2013, and thus the October 2014 examiner's opinion does not weigh against the claim.  

With regard to the effective date of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, the evidence supports an effective date of October 11, 2019.  In this regard, a treatment note of that date reflects the Veteran's complaints of buttock pain, left greater than right.  The Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and finds that this likely represents an initial manifestation of the right lower extremity radiculopathy diagnosed in October 2020.  

The Veteran is not entitled to an effective date of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy prior to March 9, 2009.  In this regard, the Board acknowledges that there is evidence that the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy had manifested prior to March 9, 2009.  However, the October 1977 rating decision awarded a noncompensable rating for a back disability, and that decision is final.  To the extent that the Veteran argues that her February 1977 claim included a claim for left lower extremity radiculopathy as part of her claim for back problems, any such claim was implicitly denied.  In this regard, the Cogburn factors weigh in favor of implicit denial for left lower extremity radiculopathy for the same reasons they weigh in favor of implicit denial for a left hip disability: the October 1977 rating decision denied claims filed on the same form, at the same time, using essentially the same language as the Veteran used in her claim, and any claim for radiculopathy would be closely related to a claim for a left knee disability and back problems.  While the fourth Cogburn favor weighs in favor of the Veteran, the totality of the Cogburn factors weigh in favor of implicit denial.  Thus, as the Board cannot award benefits based on the Veteran's February 1977 claim, the earliest applicable date of claim is March 9, 2009.

Additionally, the Board acknowledges that there is evidence discussing the Veteran's left lower extremity symptoms on March 20, 2008, during the one-year lookback period prior to the date of claim.  However, the evidence does not show a factually ascertainable increase in disability during the lookback period.  Accordingly, the evidence does not support an effective date of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy prior to March 9, 2009.

With respect to right lower extremity radiculopathy, the weight of the evidence does not show that right lower extremity radiculopathy manifested prior to October 11, 2019.  While the Veteran is competent to report her symptoms, differentiating radiculopathy from other complaints is a complex question that is beyond the knowledge of a layperson.  The evidence does not show that the Veteran has the necessary skill, experience, and training necessary to competently diagnose radiculopathy associated with her back disability.  Accordingly, entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 11, 2019, for the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is not warranted.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

6. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability, as secondary to a left ankle disability, is remanded.

Remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  In this regard, the Veteran asserts that her right shoulder disability is due to her left ankle disability, as her right shoulder disability was incurred as a result of fall when her left ankle gave out.  Although the Veteran noted her right ankle as the primary disability on her claim, see February 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, the February 2020 examiner provided an opinion addressing the service-connected left ankle.  See February 2020 Shoulder Opinion.  However, the AOJ did not secure an adequate medical opinion. 

The February 2020 medical opinion is inadequate as it does not consider the effects of a fall caused by the Veteran's left ankle disability giving out, as claimed by the Veteran.  Moreover, an August 2020 addendum opinion addresses the Veteran's right ankle disability, and additionally the examiner used an incorrect legal standard.  Additionally, no examiner of record provided an opinion addressing aggravation.  

On remand, the AOJ should secure an adequate medical opinion addressing the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right shoulder disability.  

7. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for limitation of left hip extension is remanded.

8. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for limitation of left hip flexion is remanded.

9. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for other impairment of the left hip is remanded.

Remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error, as the October 2020 Hip DBQ is inadequate for rating purposes.  In this regard, the examiner erroneously indicated that the Veteran did not use any assistive devices, notwithstanding the evidence that she requires the use of a walker.  See, e.g., March 26, 2019 Dr. C.K. Letter; December 2019 Ankle DBQ; October 2020 Spine DBQ.  Moreover, although the examiner noted that the Veteran was not being tested during a flare-up or after repeated use over time, and further indicated that there were additional limitations during a flare-up and after use over time, the examiner estimated that the Veteran's range of motion during a flare-up or after use over time would be the same as her baseline range of motion.  See October 2020 Hip DBQ at 5, 8-9.  In the absence of an explanation as to why this additional functional loss cannot be expressed in terms of range of motion, these responses are contradictory.  

On remand, the Veteran should be afforded an adequate examination as to the severity of her left hip disability.  

10. Prior to March 15, 2019, entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

Action on this issue is deferred, as it is intertwined with the development above and the AOJ's award of initial ratings following the implementation of the awards of earlier effective dates of service connection in this decision.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right shoulder disability.  The claims file should be available to the examiner.  No further examination of the Veteran is necessary unless the examiner deems otherwise.

The examiner should address the following:

(a)	Opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability or nearly 50 percent probability) that the Veteran's right shoulder disability is due to her left ankle disability, to include as a result of a fall or falls caused by her left ankle giving out.

(b)	 Opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability or higher) that the Veteran's right shoulder disability has been made worse by her left ankle disability, to include as a result of a fall or falls caused by her left ankle giving out.

In addressing subparts (a) and (b) of this question, the examiner should address the Veteran's argument that her right shoulder disability is the result of a fall that occurred as a result of her service-connected left ankle giving out, as well as relevant medical records.  See, e.g., Medical Treatment Records Received January 29, 2009; Medical Treatment Records Furnished by SSA Received February 28, 2013.  

A complete rationale for the examiner's opinion should be provided, citing to specific evidence of record, as necessary.? If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training). 

If the inability to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation is due to a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), the AOJ should develop the claim to the extent it is necessary to cure any such deficiency.  If the inability to provide an opinion is due to the examiner's lack of requisite knowledge or training, then the AOJ should obtain an opinion from a medical professional who has the knowledge and training needed to render such an opinion.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination as to the nature and severity of her left hip disability.  The claims file should be available to the examiner.  All findings should be reported in detail.

The examiner should address the following:

(a)	Assess the severity of the Veteran's left hip disability.  In doing so, the examiner should accurately record what assistive devices that the Veteran requires.  If the examiner indicates that no assistive devices are required, it is essential to reconcile this with the evidence that the Veteran uses a walker.

(b)	Provide an opinion describing functional impairment of the Veteran's left hip disability due to flare-ups and after repeated use over time, accounting for pain, incoordination, weakened movement, and excess fatigability on use, and, to the extent possible, report such impairment in terms of additional degrees of limitation of motion.  If the examiner is unable to provide such an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner must provide a rationale for this conclusion, with specific consideration of the instructions in the VA Clinician's Guide to estimate, "per [the] veteran," what extent, if any, flare-ups affect functional impairment.  The examiner must include a discussion of any specific facts that cannot be determined if unable to opine without speculation.

If the examiner records a baseline range of motion that is identical to estimated range of motion after use over time or during flare-ups, it is essential that the examiner provide a rationale for doing so.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
