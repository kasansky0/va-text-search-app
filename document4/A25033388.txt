ORDER

The appeal as to the propriety of the creation of an overpayment in the amount of $2,825 for recurring clothing allowances from 2007 to 2011 is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

1. On December 21, 2021, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), expressing disagreement with a dispute for overpayment in the amount of $2,825 for recurring clothing allowances from 2007 to 2011. The appeal was docketed under Docket No. 211221-402209.

2. On May 18, 2022, the Veteran filed a duplicate VA Form 10182. The appeal was docketed under Docket No. 220518-243793.

3. The current appeal under Docket No. 211221-402209, is a duplicate appeal and the issues of the appeal have been addressed in a separate appeal by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) under Docket. No. 220518-243793. Therefore, this appeal is moot.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to the propriety of the creation of an overpayment in the amount of $2,825 for recurring clothing allowances from 2007 to 2011 have been met; the matter is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty from September 1988 to September 1992 and from June to July1996. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on his filing of the December 21, 2021, VA Form 10182, where the Veteran stated: 

Putting in a dispute for overpayment of $2[,]825 for reoccurring clothing allowance award print audit/ Effective August 2011 for year 2007 -2011. Debt came in Nov 2020 Aug-July. I received notice of the debt for the first time on a letter dated May 4, 2021 then on June 7th 2021and again on July 6, 2021then finally Aug 2, 2021

1. The appeal as to the propriety of the creation of an overpayment in the amount of $2,825 for recurring clothing allowances from 2007 to 2011 is dismissed. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. 

In December 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, to appeal an overpayment in the amount of $2,825 for recurring clothing allowances from 2007 to 2011. The Veteran's VA Form 10182 was received in the claims file on December 21, 2021. The appeal was docketed under this current appeal stream, Docket No. 211221-402209. 

In May 2022, VA received a second VA Form 10182 from the Veteran appealing the clothing allowance overpayment issue and electing the Direct Review docket. The Veteran's second VA Form 10182 was received in the claims file on May 18, 2022. The appeal was docketed under Docket No. 220518-243793. Notably, the VA Form 10182 received on May 18, 2022, is a duplicate of the December 21, 2021, VA Form 10182.

As a result of the above, the same issue involving the clothing allowance overpayment and debt were incorrectly placed on the Board's docket twice, under separate docket numbers. During the pendency of the appeal, the Veteran's claim was addressed in a February 2025 Board decision under Docket No. 220518-243793. Specifically, the Board remanded the Veteran's claim to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) to obtain outstanding records and correct deficiencies in notice. 

Accordingly, the appeal as to the issue of a clothing allowance overpayment or debt from years 2007 to 2011 under Docket No. 211221-402209 is duplicative and is now dismissed as moot.

As the February 2025 Board decision already addressed the issue on appeal, the Board no longer has jurisdiction over the issue. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed and any appeal for which it has no jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104, 20.201, 20.202. Accordingly, the instant appeal under Docket No. 211221-402209 is dismissed.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board notes that the Veteran is not prejudiced. This dismissal only pertains to the invalid appeal that was docketed under Docket No. 211221-402209.
