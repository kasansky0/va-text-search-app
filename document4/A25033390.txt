ORDER

The award of eligibility for agent fees to L.M., the Veteran's prior representative, based on past-due benefits awarded in a December 2022 rating decision, was improper.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a July 2008 rating decision, service connection was granted for status post hemorrhoidectomy, fistulectomy, and sphincterotomy (rectal conditions); a noncompensable rating was assigned.  The Veteran appealed the initial rating assigned and such appeal was ultimately perfected.

2. In a September 2008 Decision Review Officer (DRO) hearing, the Veteran reported that he experienced depression due to his rectal conditions.

3. In April 2011, the Veteran and L.M. validly executed and filed a VA Form 21-22a and a Fee Agreement.

4. In November 2011, a VA Form 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, was submitted.

5. In February 2013, L.M. withdrew her representation of the Veteran.

6. In an April 2013 rating decision, entitlement to a total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) was denied.

7. In a September 2017 decision, the Board granted a 20 percent rating for the Veteran's rectal conditions and denied entitlement to a TDIU.

8. In August 2018, the parties entered into a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) in which the parties agreed that a remand was warranted with respect to the issue of entitlement to a higher rating for the Veteran's rectal conditions.  The parties also agreed that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU had not been appealed and should be dismissed.  In August 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) granted the JMPR, thereby remanding the issue of entitlement to a higher rating for the Veteran's rectal conditions and dismissing the issue of entitlement to a TDIU.

9. In a March 2022 decision, the Board noted that the issue of entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric condition had been raised by the record and remanded the issue.  The Board also found that entitlement to a total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) had been raised by the record and remanded the issue.

10. In a December 2022 rating decision, service connection was granted for major depressive disorder; a 50 percent rating was assigned effective September 15, 2008, a 70 percent rating was assigned effective July 20, 2022, and a 100 percent rating was assigned effective November 22, 2022.  The decision also awarded a TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance, both effective July 20, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for agent fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the January 2023 rating decision have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2022 Fee Decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In a February 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran requested review of the December 2022 Fee Decision under the Board's direct review docket.  Under direct review, a Board decision is based on the evidence at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a hearing or accept additional evidence into the record in its direct review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of December 16, 2022, the date of the decision on appeal.

Procedural Requirements

A claim for agent fees constitutes a contested claim and, therefore, is subject to special procedural requirements.  See Mason v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 1 (2012).

Specifically, under applicable criteria, upon the filing of a notice of disagreement (NOD) in a contested claim, all interested parties are to be furnished a copy of the substance of the NOD, including the type of review requested.  38 C.F.R. § 20.403.  Thereafter, the non-appealing party has 30 days within which to file a brief, argument, or request a different type of review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.404.

Here, in a June 2023 correspondence, the Board attempted to notify L.M. that the Veteran had submitted a VA Form 10182 regarding entitlement to attorney fees, that the Veteran had requested review under the Board's direct review docket, and of the 30-day window within which to file a brief, argument, or request a different type of review.  The Board also attempted to provide L.M. with a redacted copy of the February 2023 VA Form 10182.  See June 2023 Board Correspondence.  Such correspondence was mailed to the last address of record but was returned as undeliverable.  See August 2023 Return Notice.

However, it is a claimant's responsibility to keep VA informed of their current contact information, including current address.  See Lamb v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 227 (2008); Hyson v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 262, 265 (1993).  As the June 2023 correspondence was sent to L.M.'s last known address, the Board finds that the procedural requirements with regards to contested claims have been met, and the Board may proceed with adjudication of this appeal.

Analysis

The award of eligibility for agent fees to L.M., the Veteran's prior representative, based on past-due benefits awarded in a December 2022 rating decision, was improper.

The Veteran contends that eligibility for agent fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a December 2022 rating decision was improperly awarded to L.M., his prior representative.

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.  To represent a claimant before VA, a representative must execute a power of attorney, on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative."

Agents or attorneys may charge claimants fees for representation once: (a) the agent or attorney has complied with regulatory power of attorney (POA) and fee agreement requirements; and (b) an AOJ has issued notice of an initial decision on a claim.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.631, 14.636.

In other words, agents or attorneys are eligible for the payment of fees, based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded in a decision, only if there is a valid POA and Fee Agreement AND the decision which awarded the past-due benefits was the result of a valid appeal.  

Here, the record reveals that, in April 2011, a valid VA Form 21-22a appointing L.M. as the Veteran's representative, as well as a Fee Agreement providing for the direct payment of 20 percent of past-due benefits, were submitted.  See April 2011 VA Form 21-22a; April 2011 Fee Agreement.  The record also reveals that, in a March 2022 decision, the Board found that entitlement to service connection for a mental health condition and entitlement to a TDIU had been raised as part of the appeal seeking a higher rating for the Veteran's service-connected hemorrhoids; the December 2022 rating decision followed.

However, as indicated above, in March 2013, nearly a decade prior to such issues being raised by the record, L.M. revoked her representation of the Veteran.  See March 2013 Correspondence.  Thereafter, the Veteran appointed The American Legion as their representative in November 2014.  See November 2014 VA Form 21-22.  In August 2021, the Veteran appointed S.D. as their attorney representative, who remained their representative at the time the issues of entitlement to service connection for a mental health condition and entitlement to a TDIU were raised by the record and at the time of the December 2022 rating decision, which granted such issues.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-22a.  Notably, only one representative will be recognized at a given time and, unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney constitutes a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(e), (f).

In short, as L.M. revoked her representation prior to when the issues of entitlement to service connection for a mental health condition and entitlement to a TDIU were raised by the record, and as the Veteran had other representation at such time, the Board is unable to find that L.M. provided representation with respect to such issues.  

Therefore, the Board finds that the criteria to establish eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees to L.M., the Veteran's prior attorney, based on past-due benefits awarded in the December 2022 rating decision, have not been met and, as such, the December 2022 Fee Decision awarding such fees to L.M. was improper.

Accordingly, the appeal is granted.
