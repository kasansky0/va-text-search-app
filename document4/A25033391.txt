DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

A January 5, 2021, effective date for service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine with spondylolisthesis, degenerative disc disease, and lumbar scoliosis (hereafter, "low back disability"), is granted.

An initial 70 percent rating, but no higher, effective August 9, 2019, for PTSD is granted.

An effective date of August 9, 2019, for TDIU is granted. 

An effective date of August 9, 2019, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 is granted.

REMANDED

The claim of entitlement to an initial rating higher than 10 percent prior to April 13, 2023, and higher than 40 percent thereafter, for service-connected low back disability, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim for service connection for a low back disability was received January 5, 2021, and she has continuously pursued service connection since then.

2. The Veteran's PTSD has manifested with social and occupational impairment with deficiencies in most areas since the effective date of service connection, August 9, 2019.  She has not had total social and occupational impairment during the period on review.

3. The Veteran's PTSD has caused her to be unable to obtain and maintain substantial gainful employment since August 9, 2019.

4. The Veteran has a total and permanent rating starting from August 9, 2019.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1978 to March 1981.

This appeal is from a July 2023 rating decision and an October HLR (higher level review) rating decision.  The Veteran timely appealed to the Board, asking for placement on the direct review docket.  This means that the record closed on the date of notification of each decision on review, and that the Board's consideration of the evidence is restricted to that which was of record on the date of notification.

The Veteran's low back and PTSD claims were addressed in the July 2023 rating decision, which had a notification date of July 21, 2023.  The record closed with respect to these claims on that day.  

The Board notes that the VA form 10182 does not actually list PTSD, but it appears this was an error.  The issue specifically listed is, "evaluation to include rating back to date of claim, 8/9/19, to include entitlement to TDIU."  The Board finds this was referring to the PTSD, which has an effective date of August 9, 2019.  In further support of this finding, PTSD was addressed in the attached argument, and PTSD is the only other rating addressed in the July 2023 rating decision (apart from the low back, which is also on appeal).  Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran appealed the initial rating for PTSD.  

The Veteran's TDIU and DEA were reviewed in the October 2023 rating decision, and originated from a September 2023 rating decision, which had a notification date of September 27, 2023.  The record closed with respect to these claims on that day.

The Veteran is advised that if she has possession or knowledge of any evidence that is relevant to the claims decided herein, she should file it along with a supplemental claim within a year of this decision.   

Finally, the Board notes that a March 2025 letter was sent to the Veteran and her representative regarding a waiver of the right to switch dockets.  This letter was sent out in error, and the Board regrets any confusion it may have caused.

1. A January 5, 2021, effective date for service connection for low back disability is granted.

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of service connection, shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.? 38?U.S.C. §?5110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.400. 

Under current regulations, in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed.? 38?U.S.C. §?5101(a); 38?C.F.R. §?3.151(a).? The term "claim" means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA on an application form prescribed by the Secretary.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.1.? 

Prior to March 2015, an informal claim was acceptable to establish a service connection claim.? See 38?C.F.R. §?3.155(a) (repealed 2015).? An informal claim included any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits.? The communication must have identified the benefit sought.? Id.? An informal claim included any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits.? The communication must have identified the benefit sought.? Id.? In order for a document to be recognized as an informal claim, "there must be a reasonable expectation for VA to act in the manner that the claimant intended."? King v. Shinseki, 23?Vet. App.?464, 470 (2010).

Under the modernized system, which controls in this decision, a claim can be continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued.  If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  In 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p), the AMA categorizes claims as either "supplemental" or "initial."  An "initial" claim cannot establish continuous pursuit, regardless of whether it was received within one year of the issuance of the prior VA decision.  

Turning to the facts, the AOJ (agency of original jurisdiction) assigned the current effective date for service connection for the low back disability as November 17, 2022.  This is the date of receipt of a supplemental claim for service connection.

The Veteran has appealed for an effective date of January 5, 2021, which is the date of receipt of a supplemental claim for service connection for the back.  This claim was denied in a February 2021 rating decision, but the Veteran has continuously pursued the claim since then.  Indeed, the Veteran filed a request for HLR within a year of the February 2021 rating decision, resulting in a December 2021 HLR rating decision, after which she filed the November 17, 2022, supplemental claim, which is her current effective date.

The record shows she was diagnosed with segmental and somatic dysfunction of the lumbar region in 2020.  A February 2021 VA examination shows degenerative arthritis.  The February 2021 VA examiner opined against a relationship to service, but the January 2023 VA examiner opined in favor of a relationship, resulting in the grant of service connection.  As she has had a low back disability diagnosis since the receipt of her January 5, 2021, claim, that is the appropriate effective date.

The Board does not find an even earlier effective date is warranted.  The Board notes the Veteran filed a new claim for service connection for the back in August 2020; however, the Veteran was advised that the back had been previously considered for service connection, and therefore the claim needed to be filed on a supplemental claim form.  The Veteran was further advised that no action would be taken until the correct form was received, which was not until January 5, 2021.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Prior to the above, there are no other formal or informal claims for service connection for the back that have not been adjudicated.  She filed a claim in April 1981 that was denied in April 1982, and the record does not show that any new and material evidence was received in the year thereafter.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156.  She did not appeal that decision and it is now final.  

Accordingly, there is no basis upon which to assign an effective date earlier than January 5, 2021, the date of receipt of her claim.  

The Board notes that the disability rating for this newly assigned period of service connection (from January 5, 2021, to November 17, 2022) will be assigned in the first instance by the AOJ.

2. An initial 70 percent rating effective August 9, 2019, for PTSD is granted.

The Veteran has been continuously pursuing this claim since receipt of her initial claim, August 9, 2019.  Service connection and an initial rating were granted in a December 2020 rating decision.  She filed a request for HLR within a year, in December 2021.  This resulted in a December 2021 HLR rating decision.  She filed a supplemental claim in November 2022 that was addressed in a December 2022 rating decision.  She filed a supplemental claim in April 2023, which resulted in the July 2023 rating decision on appeal.  

Thus, the period on review starts on August 9, 2019, the effective date of service connection.  The Board is restricted to the evidence of record at the time of the decision on review, so the Board may consider the evidence up until July 21, 2023.

The Veteran's PTSD is currently rated 50 percent disabling, effective from August 9, 2019, and 70 percent disabling from October 24, 2022, under DC 9411.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  

She has argued that her 70 percent rating should be assigned for the entire period on review.  She has not argued that a 100 percent rating is warranted; indeed, her appeal specified that she was requesting an earlier effective date for her 70 percent rating.  Based on the appeal being from the rating decision granting service connection, the issue is one of increased rating as the entire period is before the Board and this allows the Board to use the regulations most beneficial to this appeal. Thus, the inquiry here is whether she meets the criteria for a 70 percent at any time during the period on appeal.

Under DC 9411, a 50 percent evaluation is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands, impairment of short and long-term memory; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and, difficultly in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  Id. 

A 70 percent evaluation is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.? Id.? 

A 100 percent evaluation requires total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and, memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.? Id.? 

The symptoms listed above serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating, and are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list.? See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16?Vet. App.?436, 442-44 (2002).? 

According to the applicable rating criteria, when evaluating a mental disorder, the frequency, severity, duration of psychiatric symptoms, length of remissions, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission must be considered.  See 38?C.F.R. §?4.126(a).

Turning to the evidence, and in resolving doubt in her favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms caused social and occupational impairment with deficiencies in most areas since the effective date of service connection.  

In January 2020, she was anxious and the clinician noted that the Veteran appears to be constantly battling her memories leading her to often be emotionally absent or to dissociate.  She had a constricted affect and her behavior was guarded.  

The October 2020 VA examiner noted the Veteran had difficulty with her family relationships due to emotional numbing, and that she also had trouble with intimacy in her marriage.  The Veteran reported that she had worked as a teacher but found it difficult to obtain a position where she felt safe.  She obtained a degree to get a position in administration but her increasing anxiety and panic at work led her to retire.  She has not worked full-time since 2013.  Her symptoms include depressed mood, persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about herself/others/the world, persistent and distorted cognitions about the cause or consequences of her traumatic events, hypervigilance, and suspiciousness. 

The above-cited evidence sufficiently shows deficiencies in most areas, including family relations, work, mood, and thinking.  The Board finds that the evidence shows her symptoms more closely approximate the criteria for a 70 percent rating and that any doubt is to be resolved in her favor.  

The Board does not find that a 100 percent rating for total social and occupational impairment is warranted.  The record shows that she is married and that her husband is supportive of her.  She reported a fair relationship with their children.  The record does not show gross impairment of thought processes or communication, delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, disorientation to time or place, or memory loss for the names of close relatives, her own occupation, or her own name.  She is not a danger to herself or others.  Further, the Veteran's attorney-representative has specifically asserted that the 70 percent rating is warranted from the date of service connection, and this decision grants the specific benefit sought.

Accordingly, an initial 70 percent rating is warranted from August 9, 2019, and this claim is granted.

3. An effective date of August 9, 2019, for TDIU is granted.

4. An effective date of August 9, 2019, for the grant of eligibility for DEA under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 is granted.

When any impairment of mind or body sufficiently renders it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation, that impairment will be found to be causing total disability.  38?C.F.R. §?3.340.  If the total rating is based on a disability or combination of disabilities for which the Schedule for Rating Disabilities provides an evaluation of less than 100 percent, it must be determined that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to produce unemployability without regard to advancing age.  38?C.F.R. §?3.341.  In evaluating total disability, full consideration must be given to unusual physical or mental effects in individual cases, to peculiar effects of occupational activities, to defects in physical or mental endowment preventing the usual amount of success in overcoming the handicap of disability and to the effects of combinations of disability.  38?C.F.R. §?4.15. 

If the schedular rating is less than total, a total disability evaluation can be assigned based on individual unemployability if the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disability, provided that the Veteran has one service-connected disability rated at 60 percent or higher; or two or more service-connected disabilities, with one disability rated at 40 percent or higher and the combined rating is 70 percent or higher.  The existence or degree of nonservice-connected disabilities will be disregarded if the above-stated percentage requirements are met, and the evaluator determines that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities render her incapable of substantial gainful employment.  38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a). 

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" has two components, one economic and one noneconomic.  The economic component means an occupation outside of a protected environment and earning more than marginal income as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  Ray v. Wilkie, 31?Vet. App.?58, 73 (2019). 

The noneconomic component is the ability to obtain such employment.  In determining whether a veteran can secure, follow, and maintain a substantially gainful occupation, the Board must consider: (1) the Veteran's occupational history, education, skill, and training; (2) whether the Veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and (3) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  See id.

Generally, the effective date for an increased rating is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38?C.F.R. § 3.400(o). However, if it is factually ascertainable that the increase in severity had occurred within the year before the claim was filed, then the effective date is that earlier date.  38?C.F.R. §?3.400(o)(2).

Here, the Veteran's TDIU has been assigned effective from October 24, 2022, the date of receipt of her claim for a TDIU.  She has argued that TDIU should be effective from August 9, 2019, as part of her claim for a higher rating for PTSD. 

The Board agrees.  As of this decision, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for a TDIU starting from August 9, 2019.  Her TDIU has been awarded as caused by her service-connected PTSD.  The evidence pertaining to her PTSD shows that she has depression, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation, difficulty establishing effective work relationship, and difficulty adapting to stress, all of which significantly interfere with the ability to perform the physical and mental acts required of her past work.  The evidence shows she had to quit her teaching job due to her anxiety and panic, and that she did not feel safe despite moving to different jobs multiple times.

Accordingly, the Board finds that TDIU is warranted from August 9, 2019, at which point service connection for PTSD with a 70 percent rating is established.  Prior to that, the Veteran is service connected for one disability, residuals of tonsillectomy, which is rated noncompensably.

The Veteran has also appealed for entitlement to DEA benefits prior to the current effective date.  DEA benefits are payable to the child or surviving spouse of a Veteran, who will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) The Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran had a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability.  38?U.S.C. §?3510; 38?C.F.R. §?3.807(a). 

The current effective date has been assigned based on the Veteran's award of TDIU, and she has been found to have permanent and total service-connected disability.  Given the Board's finding that TDIU is warranted from August 9, 2019, she is now considered to have permanent and total disability since then.  Accordingly, her DEA benefits are warranted from August 9, 2019.

In sum, an effective date of August 9, 2019, is assigned for both TDIU and DEA benefits.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. The claim of entitlement to an initial rating higher than 10 percent prior to April 13, 2023, and higher than 40 percent thereafter, for service-connected low back disability, is remanded.

The Veteran has appealed for a higher initial rating for her back.  Upon review of the evidence, the Board has identified a pre-decisional duty to assist error committed by the AOJ prior to the decision on appeal, and is remanding for correction of that error.

VA had a duty to assist in gathering evidence in support of claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  The record shows that she provided VA with authorization in April 2023 to obtain private treatment records pertaining to the back from a Dr. C., but that the AOJ was unable to establish communication with his office and no records were received.  However, her VA treatment records show that records from that treatment provider have been scanned into her medical record.  See, for example, VA treatment records dated November 23, 2021, and December 10, 2021.  These records were not associated with the claims file, which was error because they are in the possession of VA.  It is not clear that any of the non-VA records associated with her VA medical record have been obtained, which shall be remedied on remand.  

If the Veteran has possession or knowledge of any evidence that she wishes to be considered pertaining to the rating for the back, she is advised to file it as soon as possible so that it may be reviewed in conjunction with readjudication of this claim.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain all non-VA medical records that have been associated with the Veteran's VA treatment records. See, for example, VA treatment records dated November 23, 2021, and December 10, 2021.
