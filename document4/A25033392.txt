ORDER

New and relevant evidence having been received, readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence added to the claims file since the unappealed July 2009 rating decision, which denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss, is new and tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the claim. 

2. The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is related to acoustic trauma sustained in service.

3. The Veteran's tinnitus disability is related to acoustic trauma sustained in active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. New and relevant evidence has been received, and readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is required. 38 U.S.C. § 5108 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.2501 (2024).

2. The criteria for service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385 (2024).

3. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1131, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from January 1971 to October 1972.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2024 and January 2025 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the March 2025, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement, "NOD"), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2024 and January 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Initially, the Board notes that the time for filing a request to change the elected AMA docket has not yet elapsed. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see also Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). However, in filing the March 2025 NOD, the Veteran also submitted a thorough appellate brief that included argument and consideration of the evidence of record, reiterating their election of the Direct Review Docket, and seeking specific appellate relief. Considering the argument presented, along with the favorable findings outlined herein which allow for the benefit sought (entitlement to service connection) to be granted in full, in addition to the status of the case as having been advanced on the docket, the Board finds that the Veteran has waived the remaining period for requesting a change of docket. 

Claim for Readjudication - Bilateral Hearing Loss

In a July 2009 rating decision, the Veteran was denied entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. In that decision, the AOJ determined that the evidence did not support a finding that the bilateral hearing loss disability began during the Veteran's active service, noting that the Veteran's hearing acuity did not significantly change until after his separation from service. The Veteran did not appeal that decision, but rather, filed a supplemental claim via VA Form 20-0995 in October 2024. In the rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied the readjudication of the claim, finding that new and relevant evidence had not been received. 

VA Treatment records added to the claims file since the time of the prior adjudication of the claim demonstrate that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a bilateral hearing loss disability and has continued to receive treatment. See September 2022, VA Treatment Records. The Board finds that this information is new as it had not previously been received by the VA. In addition, it is relevant, as it addresses a diagnosis and treatment for the condition. Accordingly, readjudication of the claim for service connection of tinnitus is warranted.

Service Connection - Bilateral Hearing Loss

The Veteran contends that his bilateral hearing loss disability is related to in-service noise exposure. 

Initially, the Board notes that the first two elements of service connection have been met. The Veteran has been diagnosed with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and audiometric testing results show bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Therefore, the presence of a current disability has been established. See February 2017, VA Examination Report. In addition, noise exposure has been conceded, establishing the element of an in-service injury. See December 2024 and January 2025, Rating Decisions. 

Service connection for the Veteran's bilateral ear hearing loss, therefore, turns upon whether there is a nexus relating the Veteran's current disability to his in-service noise exposure. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a). 

In December 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in relation to the instant claim. The examiner confirmed a diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion, reasoning was that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not support a finding of permanent noise injury. See December 2024, VA Examination Report. 

Service treatment records (STRs) are silent for complaints of, or treatment for, decreased hearing acuity while the Veteran was in active service. Further, the Veteran did not have a bilateral hearing loss disability for VA purposes while in active service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The Board notes, however, that the September 1970 enlistment examination and the September 1972 separation examination depict various and unusual threshold shifts in the hearing acuity of both ears. The Board finds that the threshold shift in audiometric readings is illustrative of a documented change in hearing acuity which occurred during active service. 

The Veteran is competent to report that he first experienced decreased hearing acuity during active service and that the symptoms have progressively worsened and continued ever since. Moreover, the Board finds the Veteran credible in that regard as he has consistently reported his symptoms and progression of the disability. See December 2024, VA Examination Report; December 2008, VA Form 21-526; see also Heuer v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 379 (1995); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398 (1995); Caldwell v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 466 (1991).

It is noted that lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

In sum, the Board finds that the lay evidence weighs heavily in favor of the claim and is supported by the documented threshold shift in hearing acuity during active service. Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence for and against the claim is in approximate balance. Accordingly, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) (2018); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021) (en banc).

Service Connection - Tinnitus

The Veteran contends that his bilateral tinnitus disability is related to his in-service noise exposure

As indicated above, the Veteran's noise exposure during service was conceded. In addition, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability has been found as being proximately caused by such exposure. As such, service connection for the Veteran's tinnitus disability, turns upon whether there is a nexus relating the Veteran's current disability to his in-service noise exposure. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a).

As discussed above, the Veteran's STRs do not reflect audiogram results demonstrating a hearing loss disability or otherwise depict reports of any hearing related symptoms, to include tinnitus. The December 2024 VA examiner noted that the Veteran conveyed to him that his symptoms of tinnitus had only begun ten years prior to the examination. The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion, citing to the delayed onset of tinnitus symptoms as the reasoning for such conclusion. See December 2024, VA Examination Report. However, earlier in the report, the examiner also noted that the Veteran reported the onset of his tinnitus as being greater than 10 years ago. Id. The Veteran has consistently reported that he noticed the symptom of ringing in his ears for an extended period of time. 

The Veteran is competent to report both the onset and continuity of his symptoms. The Board finds that the Veteran's reporting of his symptoms is credible. Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence for and against the claims is in approximate balance. Therefore, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to service connection for bilateral tinnitus is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) (2018); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
