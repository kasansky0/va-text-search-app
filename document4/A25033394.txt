ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of December 6, 2020, but no earlier, for a disability rating of 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

In an unappealed December 1993 rating decision, the Veteran was denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD; resolving all doubt in his favor, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ on December 6, 2020, which established an intent to file a claim to reopen a service connection issue that was subsequently granted during the period on appeal.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of December 6, 2020, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160, 3.400, 3.2500, 3.2501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1987 to July 1991, from November 1996 to February 2002 and from January 2003 to January 2005.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) higher-level review rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  That rating decision was a higher-level review of an earlier August 2023 rating decision.

In July 2024, the Veteran submitted a Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) with the December 2023 higher-level review rating decision.  The Veteran selected the direct review docket.  As this is an AMA case on the direct review docket and the rating decision on appeal is a higher-level review, the Board may only consider the evidence already of record at the time of the VA's initial August 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Earlier Effective Date Claim

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date than May 11, 2021, for the grant of service connection for PTSD.

The statutory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110.  Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For supplemental claims, potentially new evidence must be identified or included in a claim application in order for an application to be considered complete.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a)(6).  The filing date of a supplemental claim is determined according to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, with the exception of the intent to file rule found in 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b), which applies to initial claims.  38 C.F.R. § 2501(d).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i), upon receipt of a communication indicating a belief in entitlement to benefits that is submitted in writing or electronically on a supplemental claim form prescribed by the Secretary that is not complete as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i).

The Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for PTSD in 1992 and in a December 1993 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the issue.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision within one year and new and material evidence was not received within that year.  Therefore, the December 1993 decision became final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(3); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156(a)-(b), 20.302, 20.1103.

Next, on December 6, 2020, the Veteran filed a claim to reopen the previously denied service connection for PTSD issue on VA Form 21-526EZ.  On December 8, 2020, the Veteran was sent a letter informing him that his claim had been received, and that no action was required on his part at that time, as his claim was being processed.  In pursuit of the claim, the Veteran was afforded a VA PTSD examination in March 2021.  

Subsequently, in a VA letter sent on April 7, 2021, the Veteran was informed that his request for a review of the claim for PTSD had been submitted on the wrong form.  The Veteran was told that the claims review process had recently been changed by the AMA, and that he needed to use an included chart to determine which form his current claim should be filed on.  He was told no additional action would be taken on his claim unless it was filed on the appropriate form.

On May 11, 2021, VA received a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting readjudication of the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  The AOJ issued a rating decision in June 2021, which denied readjudication of the claim based on a finding that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  The Board notes that evidence used in the AOJ's decision included the above-mentioned March 2021 VA examination report that was afforded the Veteran pursuant to his December 2020 request to reopen the issue.  The Veteran was informed of his options if he disagreed with that decision, and notified of his options on preserving the effective date of his claim is he disagreed.  The Veteran appealed the denial, which ultimately led to the December 2023 rating decision in which the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD and assigned an effective date of May 11, 2021, the date of receipt of the Veteran's first VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim  

After a review of the above, the Board finds that the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ received by VA on December 6, 2020, constitutes a communication indicating a belief of entitlement to benefits that is submitted in writing that was not complete.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1).  When the Veteran was informed that his December 6, 2020, claim was deficient by letter sent on April 7, 2021, he submitted the appropriate and complete Supplemental Claim which was received by VA the next month, on May 11, 2021.

As noted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i), if VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim.  Thus, as the Veteran's complete Supplemental Claim, received on May 11, 2021, was received within 60 days of receipt of the notice of an incomplete claim, dated April 7, 2021, the Veteran's Supplemental Claim is considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim, on December 6, 2020.

Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the earliest effective date allowed by law is December 6, 2020, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is warranted.
