ORDER

The appeal of the proposed reduction in the August 2024 rating decision of evaluation of PTSD is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's compensation was not adjusted by the proposed reduction in the August 2024 rating decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the dismissal of the appeal of the proposed reduction in the August 2024 rating decision of evaluation of PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2024 rating decision. In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

After review, the Board finds disposition of this matter is warranted as a matter of law without regard to the evidence of record, and as such, the provisions of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024) to afford time for a docket switch are inapplicable. 

In August 2024, the VA notified the Veteran of a proposed reduction of his service-connected PTSD from 50 percent to 30 percent disabling. The Veteran filed the present appeal in response without any adverse action having been taken, citing the proposed reduction.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege error of fact or law in the determination from which the claimant appeals. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d). As a proposed reduction does not contain a final decision or determination on any point of fact or law, there is no specific determination to take exception to. As such, dismissal of the appeal is warranted.

It is noted that the record does not reflect that the proposed reduction was effectuated. However, should the Veteran take exception to any subsequent rating decision, to include the January 2025 rating decision that continued the 50 percent evaluation for his service-connected psychiatric disorder, he has independent appeal rights from such.
