ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 60 percent for retinitis pigmentosa is denied.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on a finding of need for aid and attendance or housebound status is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. The Veteran's (bilateral) retinitis pigmentosa manifests as impaired visual acuity to no worse than 20/40 in the right eye and no worse than 20/40 in the left eye; with average concentric contraction for the right eye at 30 degrees and for the left eye at 31 degrees; without diplopia or visual field defect; and with one to three incapacitating episodes in a twelve-month period. 

2. The evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran is housebound or in need of aid and attendance as a result of her service-connected retinitis pigmentosa.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 60 percent for retinitis pigmentosa, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.75-4.79, Diagnostic Code 6042, Diagnostic Code 6027, Diagnostic Code 6065, Diagnostic Code 6066, Diagnostic Code 6075, Diagnostic Code 6080.

2. The criteria for entitlement to SMC based on a finding of need for aid and attendance or housebound status have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 1521; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.351, 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1992 to June 1998.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the AMA, applies.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran timely appealed the March 2024 rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

In July 2024, the Board notified the Veteran that the appeal has been placed on the docket.  Thus, the appeal is properly before the Board, and this decision follows.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155 ; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589.  With the rating assigned with the award of service connection for a disability, "staged" ratings to reflect distinct periods when different levels of impairment were shown are for consideration.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and increase in disability is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 60 percent for retinitis pigmentosa is denied.

On September 12, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-2680 for an examination for housebound status or permanent need for regular aid and attendance due to her service-connected retinitis pigmentosa.  The AOJ interpreted the filing as initiating a claim for increased rating for her service-connected retinitis pigmentosa.  The Veteran is currently rated with an evaluation of 60 percent for retinitis pigmentosa under Diagnostic Code 6042.  See December 2009 Rating Decision.  

Evaluations of defective vision from noncompensable to 100 percent are based on organic impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.76(a), 4.79.  The examination for visual impairment must be conducted by a licensed optometrist or by a licensed ophthalmologist and the examiner must identify the disease, injury, or any other pathologic found.  38 C.F.R. § 4.76(b).  Examination of visual fields or muscle function will be conducted only when there is a medical indication of disease or injury that may be associated with visual field defect or impaired muscle function.  Id.  Unless medically contraindicated, the fundus must be examined with the Veteran's pupils dilated.  Id. 

Unless otherwise directed, evaluate diseases of the eye under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Codes 6000 through 6009.  Impairment of Visual Acuity is rated under Diagnostic Codes 6061 through 6066.  Impairment of Visual Fields is rated under Diagnostic Codes 6080 through 6081.  Impairment of Muscle Function is rated under Diagnostic Codes 6090 through 6091.

Diagnostic Code 6042 provides that retinal dystrophy (including retinitis pigmentosa, wet or dry macular degeneration, early onset macular degeneration, rod and/or cone dystrophy) shall be evaluated under the General Rating Formula For Diseases of the Eye.  On May 13, 2018, VA issued a final rule revising the portion of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities that address the organics of special sense and schedule of ratings-eye.  83 Fed. Reg. 15316 (April 10, 2018).  A 10 percent disability rating is warranted for localized scars, atrophy, or irregularities of the retina, unilateral or bilateral, that are centrally located and that result in an irregular, duplicated, enlarged, or diminished image.  The criteria also provide for an alternative basis for the evaluation if it results in a higher disability rating.  The alternative evaluation is based on the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye.

The criteria under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate on the basis of either visual impairment due to the particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79.  Where documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition in the past 12 months, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted.  Where documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 3 but less than 5 treatment visits for an eye condition in the past 12 months, during the past 12 months, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted.  Where documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 5 but less than 7 treatment visits for an eye condition in the past 12 months, during the past 12 months, a 40 percent disability rating is warranted.  Where documented incapacitating episodes requiring 7 or more treatment visits for an eye condition in the past 12 months, during the past 12 months, a 60 percent disability rating is warranted.

There are three notes under General Rating Formula for Diagnostic Codes 6000 through 6009.  Note: (1) provides "For the purposes of evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes.  Note: (2) provides "examples of treatment may include but are not limited to: systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions."  Note: (3) provides for the purposes of evaluating visual impairment due to the particular condition, refer to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.75 through 4.78 and 4.79, Diagnostic Codes 6061-6091.

Examinations of visual acuity must include the central uncorrected and corrected visual acuity for distance and near vision using Snellen's test type or its equivalent.  38 C.F.R. § 4.76(a).  Evaluation of central visual acuity is on the basis of corrected distance vision with central fixation, even if a central scotoma is present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.76(b).  However, when the lens required to correct distance vision in the poorer eye differs by more than three diopters from the lens required to correct distance vision in the better eye (and the difference is not due to congenital or developmental refractive error), and either the poorer eye or both eyes are service connected, evaluate the visual acuity of the poorer eye using either its uncorrected or corrected visual acuity, whichever results in better combined visual acuity.  Id. 

Diagnostic Code 6065 provides ratings where vision in one eye (the poorer eye) is 5/200 or better.  A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40.  A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.  A 50 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70.

A 100 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 5/200.  Id.

Diagnostic Code 6066 provides disability ratings where vision in one eye (the poorer eye) is 10/200 or better.  Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 10/200, a 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40.  A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.  A 50 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70.  A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100.  A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200.  An 80 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 15/200.  A 90 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 10/200.  Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 15/200, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40.  A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.  A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70.  A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100.  A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200.  An 80 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 15/200. Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/200, a 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40.  A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.  A 40 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70.  A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100.  A 70 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/200.  Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/100, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40.  A 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.  A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70.  A 50 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/100.  Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/70, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40.  A 20 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.  A 30 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/70.  Id.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/50, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40.  A 10 percent disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50.

Where visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/40, a noncompensable disability rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40 or better.  Id.

For evaluations of restrictions in visual field(s), the examiner must use either Goldmann kinetic perimetry or automated perimetry using Humphrey Model 750, Octopus Model 101, or later versions of these perimetric devices with simulated kinetic Goldmann testing capability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.77.

Determination of the average concentric contraction of the visual field of each eye by measuring the remaining visual field (in degrees) at each of the eight principal meridians 45 degrees apart, adding them, and dividing the sum by eight.  38 C.F.R. § 4.77(b).  To determine the evaluation for visual impairment when both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, separately evaluate the visual acuity and visual field defect (expressed as a level of visual acuity), and combine them under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.

Diagnostic Code 6080 provides disability ratings where there is a defect to the visual field.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79.  Under Diagnostic Code 6080, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 46 to 60 degrees bilaterally, contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 16 to 60 degrees unilaterally, or the loss of the superior half or nasal half of the visual field bilaterally.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6080.   A 20 percent disability rating may be awarded for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 6 to 15 degrees unilaterally.  Id.  A 30 percent disability rating may be awarded for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining visual field of 31 to 45 degrees bilaterally, contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 5 degrees unilaterally, or loss of the temporal or inferior half of the visual field bilaterally.  Id.  A 50 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 16 to 30 degrees bilaterally.  Id.  A 70 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 6 to 15 degrees bilaterally.  Id.   Finally, a 100 percent disability rating is warranted for concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 5 degrees bilaterally. Id.  

For evaluations of restrictions in muscle functions, the examiner must use a Goldmann perimeter chart or the Tangent Screen method that identifies the four major quadrants (upward, downward, left, and right lateral) and the central field (20 degrees or less).  The examiner must document the results of muscle function testing by identifying the quadrant(s) and range(s) of degrees in which diplopia exists.  38 C.F.R. § 4.78(a).

38 C.F.R. § 4.78(b) provides that (1) an evaluation for diplopia will be assigned to only one eye.  When a veteran has both diplopia and decreased visual acuity or visual field defect, assign a level of corrected visual acuity for the poorer eye (or the affected eye, if the disability of only one eye is service-connected) that is: one step poorer than it would otherwise warrant if the evaluation for diplopia under diagnostic code 6090 is 20/70 or 20/100; two steps poorer if the evaluation under diagnostic code 6090 is 20/200 or 15/200; or three steps poorer if the evaluation under diagnostic code 6090 is 5/200. This adjusted level of corrected visual acuity, however, must not exceed a level of 5/200.  Use the adjusted visual acuity of the poorer eye (or the affected eye, if the disability of one eye is service-connected), and the corrected visual acuity for the better eye (or visual acuity of 20/40 for the other eye, if only one eye is service-connected) to determine the percentage evaluation for visual impairment under diagnostic codes 6065 through 6066.  (2) When diplopia extends beyond more than one quadrant or range of degrees, evaluate diplopia based on the quadrant and degree range that provides the highest evaluation.  (3) When diplopia exists in two separate areas of the same eye, increase the equivalent visual acuity under diagnostic code 6090 to the next poorer level of visual acuity, not to exceed 5/200.

On March 7, 2024, the Veteran was afforded an in-person VA examination by an optometrist.  The examiner reported visual acuity as follows:

	Uncorrected Distance	Corrected Distance	Uncorrected Near	Corrected Near 

Right Eye	5/200 or worse	20/40	20/70	20/40

Left Eye	5/200 or worse	20/40	20/70	20/40

Based on the Veteran's March 7, 2024 VA examination, the Veteran's visual acuity of 20/40 for corrected distance in both the right and left eyes warrants a noncompensable rating.  The examiner noted the Veteran did not have a difference equal to two or more lines on the Snellen test type chart or its equivalent between distance and near corrected vision, with the near vision being worse.

The March 7, 2024 examiner did not identify any visual field defects nor diplopia.  However, the examiner found the Veteran had contraction of the visual field.  The examiner tested the Veteran using Goldmann kinetic perimetry.  The examiner reported visual field as follows:  

Meridian	Normal	Right	Left

Up	45	10	10

Up Temporally	55	30	10

Temporally	85	10	38

Down Temporally	85	40	32

Down	65	08	40

Down Nasally	50	38	42

Nasally	60	49	24

Up	55	50	51

Total	500	235	247

The average concentric contraction for the right eye is 30 (29.375) degrees and for the left eye is 31 (30.875) degrees.  The Veteran's visual field loss can be rated on an equivalent visual acuity for the right eye as 20/100 (6/30) and the left eye as 20/70 (6/21), which warrants an additional evaluation of 30 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.77, 4.79.

The March 7, 2024 VA examiner diagnosed preoperative cataract, which would be rated under the General Rating Formula for Disease of the Eye.  See Diagnostic Code 6027.  The examiner noted the Veteran did not have a difference equal to two or more lines on the Snellen test type chart or its equivalent.  Additionally, the examiner noted the Veteran did not have anatomical loss, light perception only, extremely poor vision or blindness, astigmatism, diplopia, scotoma, or disfigurement attributable to any eye condition.  See March 7, 2024 VA Examination.  The examiner stated the effect of the Veteran's retinitis pigmentosa was visual field constriction which could have an effect while driving at night.  Id.  

The Board finds a rating excess of 60 percent for the Veteran's retinitis pigmentosa is not warranted.  Based on the March 7, 2024 VA examination, the Veteran's visual acuity of 20/40 for corrected distance in both the right and left eyes warrants a noncompensable rating.  The average concentric contraction for the right eye is 30 degrees and for the left eye is 31 degrees.  The Veteran's visual field loss can be rated on an equivalent visual acuity for the right eye as 20/100 (6/30) and the left eye as 20/70 (6/21), which warrants an additional evaluation of 30 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.77, 4.49.  The Veteran has not been diagnosed with diplopia, visual field defects, or other impairment of muscle function.  

The Board finds the Veteran's incapacitating episodes does not warrant a higher rating.  The March 7, 2024 VA examiner noted that the Veteran had one to three medical visits for treatment in the prior 12 months.  An incapacitating episode under the General Rating Formula is defined as an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes, such as systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.49.  For incapacitating episodes requiring at least one but less than three treatment visits for an eye condition in 12 months warrants a 10 percent evaluation.  The Veteran is already in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for incapacitating episodes for his retinitis pigmentosa.  Therefore, under the General Rating Formula, the basis of visual impairment due to the Veteran's retinitis pigmentosa and incapacitating episodes substantially weighs against a finding that the Veteran's retinitis pigmentosa warrants a rating in excess of 60 percent.

Extraschedular consideration

In deciding the Veteran's claim, the Board acknowledges that lay statements and Veteran's statement generally assert that her retinitis pigmentosa is more severe than as reflected by the currently assigned disability ratings.  See October 2023 Correspondences.  However, the Board must consider the entire evidence of record when analyzing the criteria laid out in the rating schedule.  While the Board recognizes that the Veteran is competent to provide evidence regarding her observable symptomatology, she is not competent to provide an opinion regarding the severity of her symptomatology in accordance with the rating criteria.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007). 

The Board acknowledges the lay statements and Veteran's statements reported that the Veteran was unable to see in low or dark lighting or at night.  See October 2023 Correspondences.  The Veteran remained at home from dusk until dawn unless someone was available to drive and assist her to go to the grocery store, church functions, family gatherings, meetings, kids' awards ceremony, sporting events, or dinner.  Id.  

Upon review, although the lay and Veteran's statement present an exceptional disability picture for her retinitis pigmentosa, the Board finds that referral for extraschedular consideration is not warranted because the Veteran's retinitis pigmentosa does not exhibit marked interference with employment and frequent periods of hospitalization.  

Generally, disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in VA's Rating Schedule.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  However, to accord justice in the exceptional case where the criteria in VA's Rating Schedule is found to be inadequate, an extraschedular rating that is commensurate with the average earning capacity impairment caused by the service-connected disability is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1).  In this regard, an extraschedular disability rating is warranted if the case presents such an exceptional or unusual disability picture with such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization that application of the regular schedular standards would be impracticable.  38 C.F.R. § 3.321 (b)(1).

The Court has clarified that there is a three-step inquiry for determining whether a Veteran is entitled to an extraschedular rating.  Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 115 (2008).  Initially, the Board must determine whether the evidence presents such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular ratings for the service-connected disability are inadequate.  See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (holding that either the veteran must assert that a schedular rating is inadequate or the evidence must present exceptional or unusual circumstances); Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472, 478 (2016) ("[t]he rating schedule must be deemed inadequate before extraschedular consideration is warranted").

Second, if the schedular rating does not contemplate the veteran's level of disability and symptomatology and is found inadequate, the Board must determine whether the veteran's disability picture exhibits other related factors such as marked interference with employment and frequent periods of hospitalization. Thun, 22 Vet. App. at 116.

Third, if the first two Thun elements have been satisfied, then the case must be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service to determine whether, to accord justice, the veteran's disability picture requires the assignment of an extraschedular rating.  Thun, 22 Vet. App. at 116.  In other words, the first element of Thun compares a veteran's symptoms to the rating criteria, while the second element considers the resulting effects of those symptoms; if either prong is not met, then referral for extraschedular consideration is not appropriate. Yancy, 27 Vet. App. at 494-95.

As to the first prong of the Thun test, the Veteran's symptoms for retinitis pigmentosa present such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular ratings for the service-connected disability are inadequate.  The lay statements and Veteran's statements reported that the Veteran was unable to see in low or dark lighting or at night.  See October 2023 Correspondences.  The Veteran remained at home from dusk until dawn unless someone was available to drive and assist her to go to the grocery store, church functions, family gatherings, meetings, kids' awards ceremony, sporting events, or dinner.  Id.  The rating criteria for retinitis pigmentosa does not contemplate the functional effects of the inability to see at night or in low lighting.

As to the second prong, the evidence of record weighs against finding the Veteran's symptoms for retinitis pigmentosa exhibit related factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization.  Although the October 2023 correspondences discuss how the Veteran is in need of assistance in areas of low lighting and between dusk and dawn, the Veteran's spouse, daughter, and friends have stated the Veteran's daylight vision is fine.  See October 2023 Correspondences.  The Veteran was able to participate in a Rare Pearls program and other social functions when she is assisted by someone driving her at night.  Id.  Additionally, the March 7, 2024 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's eye condition did not impact her ability to work at least during the day.  

The medical evidence of record weighs against supporting the Veteran had frequent periods of hospitalization.  Although the March 7, 2024 VA examiner noted the Veteran had medical visits for treatment, the examiner noted the Veteran was being monitored for retinitis pigmentosa related retinal changes one to three times in the prior year and did not note hospitalizations.  

Accordingly, the criteria for the assignment of an extraschedular rating of the disability are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1); Thun, 22 Vet. App. 111.  As such, assignment of a rating in excess of 60 percent for the Veteran's retinitis pigmentosa on an extraschedular basis is denied.

Special Monthly Compensation

SMC provides for additional levels of compensation above the basic levels of compensation afforded by the schedular rating criteria in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  These additional levels of compensation are awarded for various types of losses or levels of impairment due solely to service-connected disabilities and for specific combinations of such impairments.  The different types of SMC available are commonly referred to by their alphabetic designations, such as SMC (k), SMC (l), etc., which correspond to the paragraphs of 38 U.S.C. § 1114, which provides the statutory authority for SMC.  These same paragraphs are codified in VA regulations, predominantly at 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a)-(i).

SMC at the aid and attendance rate (SMC (l)) is warranted when a veteran is "permanently bedridden or with such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance." 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b).

SMC is payable at the housebound rate when a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling and a separate service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, or is permanently housebound due to service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance and housebound status is denied.

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to SMC based on housebound status or aid and attendance.  The Veteran asserts that she needs assistance in at night, in low lighting and dark areas and that she is only able to leave the home during the day on her own.

Although she primarily seeks entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance, the Board will consider if the Veteran may be entitled to SMC based housebound status.  In addition to any benefits already received, a veteran may be entitled to SMC benefits where there is an established need for regular aid and attendance.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b)(3). Requiring aid and attendance means that a person is helpless or so nearly helpless as to require the regular aid and attendance of another person.

A veteran will be considered to be in need of regular aid and attendance if, by reason of her service-connected disabilities, she (1) is blind or so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity of 5/200 or less in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less; (2) is a patient in a nursing home because of mental or physical incapacity; or (3) establishes a factual need for aid and attendance under 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.351.

The criteria to be considered in establishing a factual need for aid and attendance include: the inability of a claimant to dress or undress herself, or to keep herself ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment to any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which, by reason of the particular disability, cannot be done without aid (this will not include the adjustment of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); inability of claimant to feed himself through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to her daily environment.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

Being bedridden is a proper basis for the determination.  "Bedridden" is that condition which, through its essential character, actually requires that the claimant remain in bed.  The fact that a claimant has voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has prescribed bed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice.  38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

It is not required that all disabling conditions enumerated be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made.  Moreover, it is only necessary that the evidence establish that the claimant is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need.  Determinations that a claimant is so helpless, as to need regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that the claimant's condition is such as would require her to be in bed.  They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others.  Id. 

Lastly, if not in need of regular aid and attendance, a veteran may be entitled to SMC for housebound benefits if, in addition to having a single permanent disability rated 100 percent disabling under the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, the veteran either: (1) has an additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate and distinct from the permanent disability rated as 100 percent disabling and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or (2) is "permanently housebound" by reason of disability or disabilities.  This requirement is met when a veteran is substantially confined to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical area, and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime.  See U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

Although the total disability requirement must be met by a single disability, the 60 percent requirement may be met by applying the combined rating of the veteran's remaining disabilities.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008) (noting that combined ratings to satisfy the second requirement but not the first).  Moreover, in order to be considered "permanently housebound," the requirement that the veteran be "substantially confined" to the home or its immediate premises is broadly construed and met when the veteran is simply unable to leave the home to earn a living, as opposed to requiring that the veteran be unable to leave the house at all.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).

Aid and Attendance

Based on a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that SMC for aid and attendance is not warranted.

First, the Veteran does not contend, nor does the evidence show, that she is blind or so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity of 5/200 or less in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less.  The March 7, 2024 VA examiner reported visual acuity as 20/40 in both eyes with a visual field of 30 degrees for the right eye and 31 degrees for the left eye.  Next, the Board observes that the Veteran resides at home and has not been admitted to a skilled nursing facility nor is the Veteran bedridden and required to remain in bed.  Accordingly, the inquiry will turn to whether the Veteran has a factual need for aid and attendance for her retinitis pigmentosa.

The Board notes the Veteran's assertion that she is confined to her home and in need of regular aid and attendance of another.  See September 13, 2023 VA Form 21-2680.  She has severe night blindness.  Id.  The Veteran asserts that she is restricted to her home from dark until morning sunlight without assistance of another person.  Id.; see also October 2023 Correspondence.  During the evening when it is dark, she is unable, without the assistance of another, to drive or leave the home or immediate premises; to go outside the home; or to go to low lighting areas such as restaurants, indoor auditoriums, or social events.  See October 2023 Correspondence.  The Veteran's spouse, daughters, sister, mother, and friends have been assisting the Veteran due to the Veteran having difficulty seeing and driving at night and dimly lit environments.  Id.  They would assist her by taking her to and from church revival, family gatherings, different events, or simply taking her to get food for dinner.  Id.  They would help her while they are in places that are dimly lit.  Id.  Friends would help the Veteran attend Rare Pearls social activities and have noticed that the Veteran has trouble seeing at outings with low lighting.  Id.  The Veteran's spouse stated that the Veteran would leave lights on to see, which would raise their electric bill.  Id.  

The Board finds the statements made in the October 2023 Correspondences credible as they are consistence with the evidence of record, and thus, afforded probative weight.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990) (the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Although the statements from the Veteran and her loved ones are competent in regard to reports of symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to them through their senses, they are not competent to identify a specific level of disability of her service-connected retinitis pigmentosa.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991).

Despite the statements of the Veteran and her spouse, children, mother, and friend, the evidence does not demonstrate a factual need for aid and attendance under 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).  Specifically, after a detailed and comprehensive review of the record, the evidence reflects that, although the Veteran has issues with her service-connected retinitis pigmentosa, they do not rise to a level that would necessitate the provision of aid and attendance.  The Veteran does not assert that she has an inability to dress or undress herself, or the inability to keep herself ordinarily clean and presentable.  The Veteran does not have frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid.  Although the Veteran needs assistance to eat in dimly lit restaurants and assistance to go grocery shopping, the Veteran does not have an inability to feed herself through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness.  The Veteran has not asserted an inability to attend to the wants of nature.  The Veteran does not have an incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect her from hazards or dangers incident to her daily environment as the Veteran's husband has stated that the Veteran has left lights on in order to see.  

In arriving at this conclusion, the Board acknowledges the statements from the Veteran and her loved ones.  However, the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran's service-connected retinitis pigmentosa caused significant interference with her daily activities to the extent that it would require the need for regular aid and attendance of another person.  Instead, as discussed, the evidence indicates that the Veteran's need for aid and assistance stems mostly from nighttime activities outside the home.  Moreover, the evidence also does not indicate that assistance is required to protect her from the hazards and dangers of her daily environment as a result of her service-connected retinitis pigmentosa.  Therefore, a factual need for aid and attendance has not been established.

Housebound Status

Based upon a review of the evidence of record, the Board determines that the requirements for SMC based on housebound status have not been met.

As an initial matter, the Veteran does not meet the schedular basis for housebound status.  Specifically, while she is in receipt of a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) for her service-connected mood disorder and retinitis pigmentosa, she does not other service-connected disabilities.  The Veteran does not have a single disability rated 100 percent disability with an additional disability or disabilities independently rated at 60 percent or more.

Moreover, the evidence does not indicate the Veteran is "permanently housebound" due to her service-connected retinitis pigmentosa on a factual basis.  As discussed, while the Veteran's service-connected retinitis pigmentosa keeps her bound to her house at night, she is able to leave with the assistance of others, and she is not bound to her house during daytime hours even without the assistance of others.  Additionally, the March 7, 2024 VA examiner opined the Veteran's retinitis pigmentosa does not impact the Veteran's ability to work.  For these reasons, the Board finds the Veteran is not substantially confined to her dwelling.  Therefore, SMC is also not warranted on this basis.

?

In sum, the evidence does not support the Veteran's claim for SMC by reason of the need for regular aid and attendance or housebound status as the Veteran is able to perform most of her activities of daily living independently during the day, with assistance traveling at night and in dimly lit environments, and is not substantially confined to her dwelling.  Therefore, the Veteran's appeal is denied.
