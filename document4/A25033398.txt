ORDER

Entitlement to an initial 50 percent rating for other headache syndrome, effective March 13, 2022 is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, he experiences headaches two to three times per week that render him unable to function.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an initial 50 percent rating for other headache syndrome, effective March 13, 2022

The Veteran is service connected for other headache syndrome rated as noncompensable from March 13, 2022 and 30 percent disabling from April 10, 2023 under 38 C.F.R. § 4.12a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8199-8100.  Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the rating assigned.  38 C.F.R. §4.27. Here, the use of DCs 8199-8100 reflects that the Veteran's headache syndrome is an unlisted condition noted as 8199, and the rating assigned is done by analogy to migraine headaches under DC 8100.   

Under DC 8100, a 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once per month over the last several months.  And a 50 percent rating, the highest rating available, is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The Board considers VA Adjudication Procedures Manual, M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.e. (February 26, 2025), which specifically defines the terminology used in 38 C.F.R. § 4.214a, DC 8100.  The manual defines "prostrating" as causing extreme exhaustion, powerlessness, debilitation or incapacitation with substantial inability to engage in ordinary activities.  Completely prostrating is defined as extreme exhaustion or powerlessness with essentially total inability to engage in ordinary actives.  The M21-1 defines very frequent prostrating attacks as occurring on average, less than one month apart over the last several months, and it defines severe economic inadaptability as denoting a degree of substantial work impairment.  It does not, according to the M21-1 mean that the individual is incapable of any substantially gainful employment.

In support of the Veteran's headache claim, two VA medical opinions were obtained, one in April 2022, and another in April 2023.  In the April 2022 opinion, the examiner indicated in a checkbox that the Veteran does not experience prostrating attacks.  However, that is inconsistent with the Veteran's lay statements of record at the time of the report.  Accordingly, the Board affords that opinion minimal probative weight.  Similarly, in the April 2023 opinion, the examiner indicated via check box that the Veteran experienced prostrating attacks once per month, and that is inconsistent with the Veteran's lay statements of record at the time of the opinion. Thus, the Board affords that opinion minimal probative weight as well.  In the March 2022 Statement in Support of the Claim, the Veteran reported experiencing two to three headaches per week that rendered him unable to function at all.  In the April 2023 Statement in Support of the Claim, the Veteran reported  experiencing headaches three to four times per week.  He further reported that his headaches "knock [him] out of commission to the point that [he] is totally incapacitated and unable to do any normal daily activities for four hours" a couple of times a month.  

The Veteran is competent to report on how often he experiences headaches and the associated symptoms.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(A)(2); See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on all things of which he has personal knowledge derived from his own senses).  And there is no indication that he is anything less than credible.  Accordingly, the Board affords his statements significant probative weight.  Furthermore, in an April 2023 independent medical opinion, the provider opined that the Veteran is eligible for a 50 percent disability rating based on frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  While rating evaluation is out of the purview of that examiner, the Board acknowledges the provider's apparent corroboration of the Veteran's reported symptoms.  Accordingly, the Board affords that opinion some probative weight.

Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that he suffers from very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.   

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an increase in evaluation is fixed as of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  The date of application is considered the date that the initial application for a benefit was filed if the claim is continuously pursued by filing, either alone, or in succession, a request for higher-level review, supplemental claim, or notice of disagreement within one year of the date in which the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a decision.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2).  Here, the Veteran continuously pursued his claim to establish an appropriate initial rating for his service-connected headache disability, and the Board finds that he experienced very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability throughout the period on appeal.  Therefore, the Board now grants a 50 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected other headache syndrome, effective March 13, 2022 (the date of the claim of entitlement to service connection for headache disability).
