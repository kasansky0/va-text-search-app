DATE:  April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's OSA disability had its onset during active service and has continued ever since.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for OSA are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 1989 to November 2007, including service in Southwest Asia from April 2003 to May 2003.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the August 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement, "NOD"), the Veteran elected the Direct Review Docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Initially, the Board notes that the time for filing a request to change the elected AMA docket has not yet elapsed. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see also Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). However, in filing the August 2024 NOD, the Veteran also submitted a thorough appellate brief that included argument and consideration of the evidence of record, reiterating their election of the Direct Review Docket, and seeking specific appellate relief. Considering the argument presented, along with the favorable findings outlined herein which allow for the benefit sought (entitlement to service connection) to be granted in full, the Board finds that any error in not extending the full one-year period allowed to switch review options is harmless and non-prejudicial to the Veteran. As such, the Board has continued with a decision in the appeal. 

Service Connection - Obstructive Sleep Apnea 

The Veteran contends that his obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is related to his active service. More specifically, he avers that his symptoms began during active service and have continued ever since. See April 2024, VA Form 21-4138. 

Treatment records, including numerous VA treatment and examination reports, demonstrate that the Veteran's diagnosis of OSA has been confirmed since 2014. See May 2024, VA Examination Report; see also 2014-2024, VA Treatment Records; April 2024, Private Medical Opinion. Therefore, the Board finds that the first element of service connection has been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

As to the issue of an in-service injury, the Veteran's toxic risk exposure has been conceded based upon his confirmed service in Kuwait from April 2003 through May 2003. See generally, Military Personnel Records; August 2024, Rating Decision; April 2024, Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum. In this regard, the Veteran has also argued that due to his exposure to fine particulate matter, without respiratory protection, he began experiencing symptoms of OSA during active service. See April 2024, VA Form 21-4138. Although OSA is not a condition for which presumptive service connection applies based upon the claimed and conceded in-service injury, direct service connection may still be established with sufficient evidence of a corresponding nexus. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.320. 

Service treatment records (STRs) are silent as to any diagnosis of OSA during active service. Notably, however, in November 1998, while being treated for migraine headaches, the Veteran reported that he was sleeping well. See November 1998, STR. The Board finds that this evidence corroborates the Veteran's assertion that he did not begin experiencing sleeping difficulties until after his in-service injury of exposure to fine particulate matter. Additional medical records from the Veteran's active service demonstrate that in January 2007, prior to the Veteran's separation from service, that he underwent a sleep study. The overall finding was that there was "no evidence of a significant sleep related respiratory disorder." See January 2007, Medical Report (emphasis added). While the Board finds that this evidence weighs against the claim, it is not dispositive of the issue at hand, as it also depicts the Veteran's credible reporting that his sleep trouble began several years earlier, in 2003, following his overseas deployment to Kuwait. 

In May 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in relation to the instant claim. The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion, reasoning that there had been no diagnosis of the disability until 7 years after the Veteran's separation from service. In considering the Veteran's in-service respiratory exposure to fine-particulate matter, the examiner also opined that there is no medical relationship between such injury and the occurrence of OSA. See May 2024, VA Examination Report. 

In support of his claim, the Veteran also submitted a private medical opinion. See April 2024, Private Medical Report. In that opinion, the authoring physician provided a thorough and detailed analysis of the onset of the Veteran's symptoms in relation to the respiratory exposure during active service. In describing the pathology for OSA, the report cites to medical literature which describes an etiological relation between ambient-derived pollution exposure and OSA. It is further detailed that such exposure causes inflammation of the airway and disruption to the autonomic nervous system, thereby leading to the onset of OSA in some cases. Id. Given these medical reports, along with consideration of the Veteran's reported symptoms and later diagnosis of OSA, the private physician opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's OSA is due to the claimed in-service injury. Id.

Considering the lay statements of the Veteran's symptoms experienced in service later diagnosed as OSA, the consistent service treatment records, and the medical opinions of record; the Board finds that the evidence for and against the claim is at least in approximate balance. Therefore, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to service connection for OSA is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) (2018); see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
