FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from March 1981 to March 1985.

This case comes to the Board on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision, which granted entitlement to a total disability rating for compensation based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities from November 9, 2019 to August 30, 2021; and entitlement to dependents' educational assistance (DEA) benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 from November 9, 2019 to August 30, 2021. The Veteran appealed the decision to the Board. In an October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

Unfortunately, the Veteran passed away in March 2025 during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim(s) at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the Veteran. Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant." The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/. If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the Veteran's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
