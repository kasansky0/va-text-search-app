ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's GERD was manifested by persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal pain, but his symptoms were not productive of considerable impairment of health. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1995 to September 2016. 

This matter comes before the Board from a May 2023 rating decision. In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence which was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Governing Law 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Rating Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the Rating Schedule. 

If two disability ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. In view of the number of atypical instances, it is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. It is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. 

In general, when an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?55, 58 (1994). However, staged ratings are also appropriate in any increased rating claim in which distinct time periods with different ratable symptoms can be identified. Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505, 509 (2007). 

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD is denied. 

The Veteran, by and through his representative, asserts entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent. Service connection for GERD as secondary to a right shoulder impingement with mild degenerative arthritis was granted in a May 2023 rating decision, which assigned a 10 percent disability rating effective February 23, 2023. 

Regulations provide that when a disability is not specifically provided for in the rating schedule, it will be rated under a closely related disease or injury, in which both the functions affected, and the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. Effective May 19, 2024, GERD was added to the rating schedule. These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or which are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after May 19, 2024. Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whichever criteria is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied. 

Here, the rating criteria for GERD changed while this claim was pending. As such, the Veteran's disability will be considered under both the old and new rating criteria, and whichever criteria is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied. The Veteran's GERD?was previously rated as 10?percent disabling by analogy under DC 7399-7346 for hiatal hernia. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. The additional code is shown after the hyphen. 

Under the rating criteria prior to May 19, 2024, DC 7346 regarding a hiatal hernia warrants a 10 percent rating for two or more of the symptoms listed for a 30 percent evaluation, of less severity; a 30 percent rating is warranted for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health; and a maximum 60 percent rating is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss, and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346. 

A key difference between a 10 percent and a 30 percent rating is the severity of the symptoms, with a 10 percent rating having symptoms of less severity and a 30 percent rating having symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health. A Veteran can have some or all the symptoms listed in the criteria for a 30 percent rating but if they are not productive of considerable impairment of health then they do not warrant a 30 percent rating. 

The Board finds this rating criteria more favorable to the Veteran than the rating criteria for GERD as of May 19, 2024, which requires a documented history of esophageal strictures for a minimum compensable disability rating of 10 percent, which the Veteran's medical records and examinations do not show. 

The probative evidence of record reflects the Veteran's?GERD warrants a disability rating of 10 percent, but no higher. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2023. The examiner continued a diagnosis of GERD, and recorded symptoms of dysphagia, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, nausea, vomiting, and sleep disturbances caused by esophageal reflux. The examination did not note symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health. The examiner noted the Veteran reported symptoms of burning, burping, belching, early satiety, and regurgitation of food. 

In a February 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran reported avoiding certain foods which worsen his symptoms, and that the avoidance of these foods caused vitamin deficiencies requiring the Veteran to take supplements. He also reported using antacids once or twice a week to control heartburn. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms and his reports are credible. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). However, the Board also acknowledges the Veteran is service connected for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which encompasses the recorded symptom of sleep disturbances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. prohibits "evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses."  As such, the Board finds the symptom of sleep impairment is already considered by the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. 

Furthermore, the Board acknowledges the May 2023 VA examination did not note symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health. Again, a key difference between a 10 percent and a 30 percent rating is the severity of the symptoms, with a 30 percent rating having symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health. Therefore, the Board finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim and entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD is denied.
