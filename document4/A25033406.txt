DOCKET NO. 240612-447886
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The request for revision of the December 2008 rating decision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the award of service connection for chronic thoracic sprain with an initial noncompensable rating effective January 9, 2007, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

By a March 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) found CUE in the initial evaluation assigned for the thoracic spine condition and awarded an increased 10 percent retroactive to July 9, 2007.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue of whether revision of the December 2008 rating decision on the basis of CUE is warranted have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from December 1975 to January 1980.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the December 2008 rating decision (notification January 2009) granting service connection for chronic thoracic sprain with an initial noncompensable rating effective January 9, 2007, on the basis of CUE.  In June 2023, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which determined no revision was warranted in the December 2008 rating decision.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Revision to the December 2008 Rating Decision

By a March 2024 rating decision, prior to the Veteran's appeal in the instant matter, the AOJ found CUE in the initial evaluation assigned for the thoracic spine condition and awarded an increased 10 percent retroactive to July 9, 2007.  

In an August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed the initial rating assigned in the March 2024 rating decision.  This matter has been certified to the Board and is the subject of a separate appeal.  

The Board may dismiss an appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). As the Veteran's CUE motion has been granted by the AOJ, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration with regard to this appeal. 

?

Accordingly, the appeal concerning the issue of CUE in the December 2008 rating decision is dismissed.
