DOCKET NO. 240504-437510
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to February 17, 2022, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits under Chapter 35 were assigned effective February 17, 2022, the same date a combined evaluation of 100 percent was assigned; the Veteran was not rated totally and permanently disabled prior to February 17, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than February 17, 2022, for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits under Chapter 35 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 5113; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2010 to December 2013. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) decision by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). With regard to the effective date of DEA eligibility, the evidentiary record was set by an April 2023 (with May 2023 notice) rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601, 20.301. No evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that since the February 2022 Intent to File which eventually gave rise to this appeal, three rating decisions have considered, in various configurations, 15 individual issues involving service connection, increased ratings, and earlier effective dates.  In filing an October 2023 substantive appeal and a March 2024 request for HLR, the Veteran listed and addressed specific issues and points of contention to be appealed.  In filing the May 2024 VA Form 10182 which led directly to this Board appeal, however, he listed ONLY the date of eligibility for DEA. While he referenced the evaluations and effective date of combined rating for his disabilities generally, he did not place any of those at issue.  The appeal is therefore limited to the issued explicitly listed. Any other reading would be too indefinite to allow identification of the issues; moreover, the Veteran has demonstrated he is capable of specificity if he intended to appeal certain matters.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board acknowledges that it has been less than one year since the date of the notification letter of the appealed decision. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). The Veteran submitted correspondence requesting advancement on the docket for his appeal in July 2024. The Board construes this request as a waiver of the right to request a docket switch. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

The Veteran claims he is entitled to an earlier effective date for eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35. 

Eligibility for DEA is triggered when the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability. See 38 C.F.R. 3.807(a)(2). To be found permanently and totally disabled, for the purposes of Chapter 35 benefits, the rating must be total, or 100 percent.

Generally, effective dates relating to awards of such assistance, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113. Under 38 U.S.C. § 5113(b), when determining the effective date of an award under Chapter 35 for an individual described in 38 U.S.C. § 5113(b)(2), based on an original claim, VA may consider the individual's application as having been filed on the eligibility date of the individual if that eligibility date is more than one year before the date of the initial rating decision. For these purposes, "eligibility date" means the date on which the individual became an eligible person under 38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(1), and "initial rating decision" means a decision by VA that establishes the veteran's disability as permanent in nature. 38 U.S.C. § 5113(3).

In an August 2017 AOJ decision, the Veteran was service-connected for migraine headaches, rated at 30 percent, lumbar strain, rated at 10 percent, tinnitus, rated at 10 percent, painful scar above right eye, rated at 10 percent, and traumatic brain injury (TBI), rated at 10 percent; his combined evaluation was 50 percent. 

In the April 2023 rating decision, effective February 17, 2022, the Veteran was granted service connection for cervical invertebral disc syndrome, right upper extremity radiculopathy, left upper extremity radiculopathy, right shoulder strain, and left lower extremity radiculopathy; increased evaluations were also awarded effective February 17, 2022, for his service-connected TBI, now with dizziness and posttraumatic stress disorder, from 10 percent to 50 percent, and migraine headaches from 30 percent to 50 percent. As of February 17, 2022, his combined evaluation for all service-connected disabilities was 100 percent. 

The April 2023 rating decision also awarded eligibility to DEA benefits under Chapter 35, effective February 17, 2022. That is the same effective date as the award of a 100 percent combined evaluation. 

The April 2024 HLR decision confirmed all the ratings and effective dates determined in the April 2023 decision, including the date of eligibility for DEA benefits. A permanent and total rating was not in effect prior to February 17, 2022, thus, the criteria for eligibility to DEA benefits under Chapter 35 were not met prior to February 17, 2022. 38 U.S.C. § 5113. As is noted above, the Veteran did not elect to pursue the ratings or effective dates for individual conditions further.

The pertinent legal authority governing effective dates is clear and specific, and the Board is bound by such authority. Pursuant to that authority, the Board finds that there is no legal basis by which an effective date earlier than February 17, 2022, can be assigned for eligibility for DEA benefits. Therefore, the claim for an earlier effective date must be denied.
