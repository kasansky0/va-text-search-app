ORDER

An initial rating of 50 percent, but no higher, for tension headaches is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's disability picture for tension headaches more nearly approximated very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for an initial 50 percent rating for tension headaches, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2005 to April 2006 and September 2009 to September 2010.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision issued by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). This rating decision was a higher-level review decision that considered the evidence of record at the time of a prior May 2023 decision by the AOJ.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected to appeal the issue listed above and requested a direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 decision. 38?C.F.R. § 20.303.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Board determines the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his/her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, and the assigned rating is based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairment of earning capacity in civil occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.10. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings should be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where service connection has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, the Board notes that the Veteran is appealing the initial assignment of a disability rating, and as such, the severity of the disability is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the evaluation to the present. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for the service-connected tension headaches.

The Veteran contends that a 50 percent rating is warranted for her service-connected tension headaches. See August 2024 Notice of Disagreement. 

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a 30 percent rating for tension headaches from March 22, 2022. See August 2022 Rating Decision.

Tension headaches are rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100, for headaches. Under DC 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for headaches with less frequent attacks. A 10 percent rating is warranted for headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months. A 30 percent rating is warranted for headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months. A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. A 50 percent rating is the highest schedular rating under DC 8100.

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App.?245, 252 (2018). This renders 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable. Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of headaches, but it is not defined in the regulation. Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe headache attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The rating criteria for a 50 percent rating contain several undefined phrases. The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating. Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253. The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraines attack must render the veteran entirely powerless. Id. The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract." Id. (internal citation omitted). Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability." Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating. Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445-46 (2004).

The Board concludes that the Veteran's tension headaches have more nearly approximated frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability throughout the appeal period, corresponding to the criteria for a 50 percent rating.

In April 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA where she reported constant head pain. It was noted that these headaches typically last less than one day. These headaches resulted in vomiting, sensitivity to light, changes in vision, and blurry vision." The Veteran reported pulsating or throbbing head pain on both sides of the head that is worse with physical activity." She reported that "she often has to pull over on the side of the ro[ad] if she is driving due to blurry vision and head pain." She also reported that "often she would have to find a place to sit down if she is out in town [] due to the head pain." It was noted that the Veteran "does not like to take medication[,] so she tries to just deal with the pain." It was also noted that she "usually just closes her eyes and lays down." 

The April 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran does have prostrating attacks of migraine about once every month. The examiner found that the Veteran did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.

In a March 2023 statement, the Veteran reported that she "have stopped on the side of the road, and have had to go to sleep to try to care for myself when a headache comes on." She stated that "[w]hen I am having a headache, I can't look at the TV." She explained that "I need to be in a dark room, and sometimes I use a washcloth with hot water on my head to try to help myself get to sleep." She noted that her headaches "are also happening more frequently that they used to[.]" For example, she noted, "now I have them several times a day where I have to lay down and try to sleep it off." She also noted "I do not have days without headaches." 

In April 2023, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination. No interview or in-person examination was conducted as the VA examiner deemed the medical evidence of record sufficient for completing the headaches disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ). The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's treatment plan includes taking medication for the diagnosed condition. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran experienced constant head pain on both sides of the head, lasting approximately one day in duration, and without any associated non headache symptoms. No prostrating attacks were noted. The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's headaches had no functional impact. 

The Board finds that the April 2023 VA examination is inadequate because it does not document sufficient information to evaluate the severity of the Veteran's tension headaches. The VA examiner does not appear to have considered the Veteran's March 2023 statement. Additionally, the examiner did not consider the April 2022 VA examination. The Board cannot conclude that the April 2024 VA examination is adequate for adjudication purposes. 

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that an increased 50 percent rating is warranted for tension headaches throughout the appeal period. The Veteran reported daily headaches that sometimes cause her to lie down. See March 2023 VA Form 21-4138. Moreover, she reported progressive worsening in intensity, frequency and duration and reported pain occurring on both sides of the head.

The Veteran is competent to report readily observable symptoms such as the frequency and severity of her headache pain. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Further her reports are credible, as shown by her consistent reports of headache pain.

The Board acknowledges that the April 2022 VA examiner found that the Veteran's prostrating headaches were not productive of severe economic inadaptability. However, the Board finds that the evidence of record demonstrates the functional impairment of the Veteran's tension headache symptoms rose to the level of severe economic inadaptability required for a 50 percent disability rating under DC 8100. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's headaches are manifested by very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of or at least capable of producing, severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Accordingly, as the evidence of record, as a whole, supports a finding that the Veteran experiences tension headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks of headache pain productive of severe economic inadaptability, the Board finds that a maximum disability rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100 is warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.
