ISSUE

The validity of overpayment debt of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation benefits in the amount of $351.91 due to receipt of active service pay for the equivalent of 8 drill days in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023.

ORDER

The overpayment of compensation benefits in the amount of $351.91 was proper; the appeal as to the validity of the debt is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was discharged from active service on May 14, 2022. 

2. A November 2023 rating decision granted service connection for tinnitus, with an effective date of May 15, 2022.  He was awarded a payment of $2,740.96 in retroactive VA compensation benefits.  

3. The Veteran received active service drill pay in FY 2023 for 8 days.

4. The Veteran received concurrent VA disability compensation and active service drill pay in FY 2023 for 8 days.

5. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) retroactively adjusted the Veteran's VA compensation benefits based on 8 days in FY 2023; this action resulted in a combined overpayment, totaling $351.91.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The overpayment of compensation benefits in the amount of $351.91 was validly created. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5304(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.654, 3.700.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from May 2018 to May 2022.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Debt Management Center (DMC). 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

The validity of overpayment debt of VA disability compensation benefits in the amount of $351.91 due to receipt of active service pay for the equivalent of 8 drill days in FY 2023

The Veteran challenges the validity of the overpayment debt in the amount of $351.91 because she did not receive concurrent VA compensation and drill pay.  See April 2024 VA Form 10182.  She contends she received drill payment for January and February 2023 only.  Id.  She further contends that she did not apply for VA compensation benefits until July 2023 and did not receive her first payment until November 2023.  Id.  For the reasons explained below, the Board finds that the overpayment debt is valid.

For a determination that an overpayment was improperly created, it must be established that the debtor was either legally entitled to the benefits in question or, if the debtor was not legally entitled, then it must be shown that VA committed a sole administrative error, i.e., that VA rendered a decision of entitlement based upon mistake of fact, misunderstanding of controlling regulations or instructions, or misapplication of law. VAOPGCPREC 2-90 (July 17, 1989); see also 55 Fed. Reg. 27757 (1990).

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim or a claim reopened after final disallowance will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an award of compensation benefits is the date after discharge if a relevant claim is received within one year from that date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b). 

In general, there is a prohibition on the concurrent payment of VA disability compensation and active service pay. 38 U.S.C. § 5304 (c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.654, 3.700. Active service pay includes drill pay. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.654, 3.700. Reservists may waive their pension, compensation, or retirement pay for periods of field training, instruction, other duty, or drills. 38 C.F.R. § 3.700 (a)(iii). A waiver may include prospective periods and contain a right of recoupment for the days for which the reservist did not receive payment for duty by reason of failure to report for duty. Id. 

The Veteran was discharged from active service on May 14, 2022.  

Within 1 year of discharge, in June 2023, the Veteran applied for VA compensation benefits.  

A November 2023 rating decision granted service connection for tinnitus, with an effective date of May 15, 2022.  He was awarded a payment of $2,740.96 in retroactive VA compensation benefits.  

In a February 2024 VA Form 21-8951 (Notice of Waiver of VA Compensation to Receive Military Pay and Allowances), VA notified the Veteran that it planned to retroactively adjust his compensation benefits based on 8 drill days received in FY 2023.  

VA requested that the Veteran elect whether he wanted to waive: VA compensation benefits or military pay.  It also permitted the Veteran to report that he did not receive any military pay during the noted fiscal year. It noted that a fiscal year ran from October 1 through September 30.  For example, fiscal year 2023 runs from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023.  

The Veteran did not return the completed waiver form.

The AOJ retroactively adjusted the Veteran's VA compensation benefits based on 8 days in FY 2023; this action resulted in a combined overpayment, totaling $351.91.

Based on the foregoing, because pertinent law and regulation prohibits payment of both active duty and VA compensation pay, the overpayment debt of VA compensation benefits in the amount of $351.91 was properly created.  The Veteran received VA compensation benefits and drill pay for the same period of time - in prohibition of the law.  In that regard, the Veteran applied for compensation benefits within 1 year of his discharge from service and was granted compensation (and retroactive compensation pay), effective the day after his May 2022 discharge.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b).

Simultaneously, the Veteran was paid for 8 drill days during FY 2023 (October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023).  Although the Veteran contends that he only had drill pay days in January and February 2023, these dates fall squarely within the FY 2023 period in question.  Due the concurrent receipt of VA compensation and drill pay, an overpayment debt in the amount of $351.91 was created due to the retroactive adjustment to the Veteran's compensation benefits.

Therefore, the debt is valid; the appeal is denied.
