REMANDED

Entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for calendar year 2023.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1989 to December 2009; she has been 100 percent disabled since March 2011. 

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim for clothing allowance based on the use of a heavy molded back brace due in part to a service-connected back disability. Subsequently, she appealed to the Board in August 2023 via a VA Form 10182 and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Turning to the evidence, the record is?missing?a significant amount of documentation concerning a clothing allowance for calendar year 2023. The claims file does not contain a copy of any applicable notice letters, VHA prosthetics records, or any pre-decisional evidence submitted or developed in relation to the claim. The substantive?decision?by the VHA is also?missing?from the claims file.?

As these pertinent documents are missing from the file, the Board does not have a complete record on which basis it can fulfill its statutory and regulatory duty to render a decision on the Veteran's claim. Therefore, remand is warranted for the AOJ to reconstruct the record and associate with the claims file all relevant clothing allowance records.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Associate with the electronic claim file all evidence considered in connection with the claim on appeal. 

2. The?record?should include (but is not limited to): the associated 2023 VHA?decision, and any other relevant documents received or generated in connection with the claim, to include any VHA or prosthetics?records.

3. If any such?records?are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the appellant with notice of the unavailability of?records.
