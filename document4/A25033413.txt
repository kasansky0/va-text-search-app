REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2005 to August 2011, to include service in Afghanistan from October 2009 to April 2010. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO)'s rating decision issued in February 2024. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In her August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran attempted to appeal an issue of service connection of hemoptysis that was denied in a July 5, 2017, rating decision. As indicated in a July 6, 2017, notification letter, the Veteran had one year from the date of the notification letter to appeal the decision by submitting a VA Form 21-0958, Notice of Disagreement. No such Notice of Disagreement was submitted within the appeal period, and a VA Form 10182 cannot be used to appeal from the July 2017 rating decision. Accordingly, the issue of service connection for hemoptysis is not considered in this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is remanded. 

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for IBS due to "SW Asia Theater." 

In support of her claim, she submitted a private Disability Benefits Questionnaire, dated August 2023, which documents the Veteran's report of onset of symptoms after she was deployed to Kuwait. 

A February 2024 VA examination also refers to her deployment to Kuwait. 

An Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER) Individual Exposure Summary Information for the Veteran was generated in September 2023. This document reflects her service in Kuwait from April 2010 to June 2010 and to Afghanistan from October 2009 to April 2010.

Prior to the issuance of the February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ verified the Veteran's service in Afghanistan. See December 2022 VA Memorandum with Subject: Toxic Exposure - Sec.1119 Covered Veteran; DD 214; April 2010 Evaluation Report & Counseling Record; March 2011 Evaluation Report & Counseling Record. However, no service personnel records associated in the claims file refer to her service in Kuwait, and the AOJ failed to verify this service, which was mentioned in the August 2023 DBQ and February 2024 VA examinations. Without verification of her service in Kuwait, both examinations are inadequate. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e). 

Accordingly, a remand is required so that the AOJ could correct the pre-decisional deficiency by verifying her service in Kuwait and develop her claim further if necessary. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain the Veteran's complete military personnel records and verify if she served in Kuwait.
