REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from November 1955 until his honorable discharge in November 1975.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). Separate evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. In other words, the evaluations may be staged. Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

1. Entitlement to an increased rating for chronic kidney disease

The Veteran contends that he should be rated 60 percent disabling for his kidney disability. 

Currently, the Veteran's kidney disability is noncompensably rated under Diagnostic Code 7530, which instructs that chronic renal disease is to be rated as renal dysfunction. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.

A 30 percent rating is warranted with GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and structural kidney abnormalities (cystic, obstructive, or glomerular) for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and either recurrent red blood cell (RBC) casts, white blood cell (WBC) casts, or granular casts for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or with GFR from 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.

A 60 percent rating is warranted for chronic kidney disease (CKD) with GFR from 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. An 80 percent rating requires CKD with GFR from 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. A maximum 100 percent evaluation is assigned for CKD with GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or requiring regular routine dialysis; or eligible kidney transplant recipient. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

VA treatment records reflect that the GFR readings were 32.30 on September 26, 2023; 30 on February 15, 2024; 29 on April 4, 2024; and 29 on April 17, 2024. 

In February 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA kidney examination where it was noted that he was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease from 2010. The examination noted that the Veteran's current symptoms are that his kidneys are not functioning properly and because of that he is in a wheelchair. The examiner noted that the Veteran's treatment plan does not include taking continuous medication and that the Veteran does not have hypertension or any other heart disease due to renal dysfunction. The examiner noted that the Veteran does not require regular dialysis, does not have a renal tubular disorder, or have a cystic, obstructive, or glomerular structural kidney abnormality for at least three consecutive months during the past 12 months. The examiner furthered that the Veteran does not have signs or symptoms of hydronephrosis due to obstruction other than upper urinary tract urolithiasis or have attacks of renal colic due to obstruction other than upper urinary tract urolithiasis. The examiner noted that the Veteran has had a malignant neoplasm that is in remission. Test results reflected that BUN was 31, creatinine was 2.11, and GFR was 30. 

Based on the above, the Board finds that a rating of 60 percent for chronic kidney disease is warranted as the Veteran meets the requirement of having GFR between 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 during the appeal period. 

The Veteran is not warranted an 80 percent rating or higher as the Veteran's chronic kidney disease has not been manifested with GFR from 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during a 12 month period throughout the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7530. Moreover, the Veteran does not require regular dialysis and is not an eligible kidney transplant recipient. 

Consequently, the Board finds that entitlement to a 60 percent disability rating, but not higher, for chronic kidney disease from September 13, 2023. 

2. Entitlement to a 30 percent disability rating, but no more, for right upper extremity neuropathy of the radial nerve 

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent disabling for left upper extremity neuropathy of the radial nerve 

4. Entitlement to a 20 percent disability rating for left lower extremity neuropathy of the sciatic nerve 

5. Entitlement to a 20 percent disability rating for a right lower extremity neuropathy of the sciatic nerve

The Veteran seeks higher ratings for his service-connected diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the left and right radial and sciatic nerves. In an August 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for left and right upper extremity neuropathy of the radial nerve with 20 percent evaluations effective September 13, 2023. The Veteran was also granted service connection for the left and right lower extremity neuropathy of the sciatic nerve with 10 percent evaluations effective September 13, 2023. 

Paralysis of the radial nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8514. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling for both the major and minor extremity. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 30 percent disabling for the major extremity and 20 percent for the minor extremity. Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 50 percent disabling for the major extremity and 40 percent for the minor extremity. Complete paralysis is rated as 70 percent disabling for the major extremity and 60 percent for the minor extremity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

Peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The terms "mild," "moderate," and "severe" under applicable diagnostic codes are not defined in the rating schedule; rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. Mild is generally defined as not being or involving what is extreme or not severe. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 787 (11th ed. 2003). Moderate is generally defined as tending toward the mean or average amount. Id. at 798. Severe is generally defined as of a great degree or serious. Id. at 1140. Moderately severe is not a precisely defined term because moderately, as an adverb, modifies severe. Thus, the Board finds that moderately severe indicates an injury that is more than moderate but less than severe, although it may encompass symptoms associated with either a moderate or severe injury.

The term "incomplete paralysis," with these and other peripheral nerve injuries, indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement. See "note" at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. However, a higher evaluation is not necessarily warranted if the disability manifests in non-sensory involvement. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376, 380 (2017) (while the note preceding § 4.124a establishes a maximum 20 percent rating for incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve where the disability is productive of wholly sensory manifestations, it does not logically follow that a disability exhibiting non-sensory manifestations must necessarily be rated at a higher level).

The Board recognizes the holding in Banschbach v. McDonough, No. 22-6609 (July 26, 2024), where the Court found that 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a does not necessarily prohibit the assignment of separate compensable ratings for paralysis, neuritis, and neuralgia. However, the record before the Board does not specifically note findings of neuritis or neuralgia, only references to nerve impairment. Accordingly, no further consideration of separate ratings under Diagnostic Code 8614 or 8620 for neuritis, or Diagnostic Code 8714 or 8720 for neuralgia, is required.

The Veteran was afforded a VA diabetic peripheral neuropathy examination in August 2024. The Veteran reported that currently his symptoms were no feeling in his feet and that his hands go numb. He also noted that it feels like he is wearing gloves all the time. The Veteran's dominant hand is his right hand. The examiner noted that the Veteran had moderate constant pain in the right and left upper extremity and mild constant pain in the right and left lower extremity. The Veteran also had moderate numbness in right and left upper extremities and right and left lower extremities. Examination also reflected that muscle strength was impaired, but that there was no muscle atrophy or trophic changes. The examiner noted that there was no movement against resistance for bilateral elbow flexion, bilateral elbow extension, bilateral grip, left knee flexion, and bilateral ankle dorsiflexion. There was less than normal muscle strength in bilateral wrist flexion, bilateral wrist extension, bilateral pinch, bilateral knee extension, right knee flexion, and bilateral ankle plantar flexion. The examiner noted that the Veteran had mild incomplete paralysis of the right and left radial nerve and mild incomplete paralysis of the right and left sciatic nerve. There was decreased deep tendon reflexes for bilateral biceps, bilateral triceps, bilateral brachioradialis, right knee, and right ankle. Deep tendon reflexes were absent for left knee and left ankle. Light touch testing was normal for bilateral shoulder area, bilateral inner/outer forearm, bilateral hand/fingers, right knee/thigh, and right ankle/lower leg. Light touch testing results were decreased for left knee/thigh, left ankle/lower leg, and bilateral foot/toes. Position sense was normal for all extremities. Vibration sensation was normal for right and left upper extremity, decreased for right lower extremity, and absent for left lower extremity. Cold sensation was normal for right and left upper extremity and decreased for right and left lower extremity. 

Based on the above, and in consideration of the Veteran's description of symptoms of peripheral neuropathy as well as the VA clinical findings, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy for both nerves were primarily manifested by symptoms of moderate incomplete paralysis during the entire appeal period. The record does not show symptoms of peripheral neuropathy more severe than moderate as the medical evidence did not reflect that the Veteran had more than moderate symptomology of sensory disturbances, constant or intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, numbness, or symptoms such as muscle atrophy or trophic changes. While the Veteran did describe symptoms of muscle weakness, the rating takes into consideration these symptoms. 

Thus, the Veteran's incomplete paralysis of the left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy of the radial nerve warrants, at most, a 20 percent evaluation for moderate left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy. As noted above, a 20 percent rating is appropriate for the non dominant upper extremity for either mild or moderate incomplete paralysis. To that end, the evidence does not show severe incomplete paralysis of the left upper extremity. In reaching this determination, the Board has considered the guidance provided by 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.120, 4.123, and 4.124. The Veteran's left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy is not manifest by severe constant or intermittent pain, severe paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, severe numbness, or no movement against gravity, absent reflexes, absent light touch, position sense, vibration sensation, or cold sensation, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis. As such, greater than a 20 percent rating is not warranted.

A 30 percent evaluation, but no higher, is warranted for moderate right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy of the radial nerve under Code 8514. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8514. The evidence does not show that severe incomplete paralysis of the right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy of the radial nerve. In reaching this determination, the Board has considered the guidance provided by 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.120, 4.123, and 4.124. The Veteran's right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy has not manifest by severe constant or intermittent pain, severe paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, severe numbness, or no movement against gravity, absent reflexes, absent light touch, position sense, vibration sensation, or cold sensation, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis.

The Veteran's moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve warrants, at most, a 20 percent evaluation each for moderate lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerves under Code 8520. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. The evidence does not show that severe incomplete paralysis of the left or right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerve. In reaching this determination, the Board has considered the guidance provided by 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.120, 4.123, and 4.124. The Veteran's left and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy has not manifest by severe constant or intermittent pain, severe paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, severe numbness, or no movement against gravity, absent reflexes, absent light touch, position sense, vibration sensation, or cold sensation, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis.

The Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt but has determined that it is inapplicable, because otherwise the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of higher ratings. 38 U.S.C. §5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
