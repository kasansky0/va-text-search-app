ORDER

The issue of eligibility for benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Due to the death of the Veteran, final approval and designation for PCAFC benefits is unachievable as both the Veteran and the Primary Family Caregiver applicant are precluded from completing and complying with all applicable requirements of the program.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the appeal for eligibility of PCAFC benefits must be denied as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1720G, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 71.10-71.60.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from May 1967 to February 1971.  His decorations included a Vietnam Service Medal and a Combat Action Ribbon. 

As an initial matter, the Board thanks the Veteran's wife for her dedication in the care of the Veteran.  Unfortunately, the Veteran passed away in June 2023.  

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) the Caregiver-Applicant elected the Evidence Submission docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, here the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Caregiver-Applicant or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

For clarity, the Board acknowledges that the Caregiver-Applicant identified disagreement with the June 2022 VHA decision.  In December 2022, a VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim was submitted regarding the June 2022 denial of PCAFC benefits.  In May 2024, the VHA issued a supplemental claim decision, continuing the denial of benefits under the PCAFC.  Nevertheless, the date of the decision on appeal (June 2022 or May 2024) has no bearing on the merits of the case, as this case is being denied as a matter of law. 

Finally, the Board notes that an appeal may not be decided prior to the deadline for requesting an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows claimants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new Notice of Disagreement within one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives the NOD, whichever is later; unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.303.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Here, the Caregiver-Applicant submitted evidence with her January 2025 VA Form 10182; therefore, she may not switch her AMA docket choice, and the Board may proceed to adjudicate the claim.

The issue of eligibility for benefits under PCAFC.

The Veteran and Caregiver-Applicant (wife) applied jointly for participation in PCAFC in May 2022.  Sadly, the Veteran died in June 2023, while the appeal was pending.  

Unfortunately, due to the death of the Veteran, the Board must deny this appeal as a matter of law.

PCAFC is a VA program that provides certain benefits to eligible veterans who have incurred or aggravated serious injuries during military service, and to their caregivers.  38 C.F.R. § 71.10(a).  An "eligible veteran" means a veteran, or a servicemember, who is found eligible for a Family Caregiver under 38 C.F.R. § 71.20.  38 C.F.R. § 71.15.  A "Primary Family Caregiver" means an individual who meets the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 71.25.  Id. 

The application requirements under 38 C.F.R. § 71.25 require that, before VA approves an applicant to serve as a Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver, the applicant must: (1) be initially assessed by VA as being able to complete caregiver education and training, and (2) complete caregiver training and demonstrate the ability to carry out the specific personal care services, core competencies, and additional care requirements.  See 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(c).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(f), final approval and designation for the Caregiver Program benefits will be conditioned on the Veteran and Caregiver "remaining eligible" for Caregiver Program benefits, including the Caregiver continuing to provide caregiver services to the Veteran and continuing compliance with all applicable requirements.

Here, the AOJ did not find the Veteran eligible for PCAFC benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 71.20 prior to his death.  See June 2022 Centralized Eligibility and Appeals Team (CEAT) decision; upheld by a May 2024 supplemental claim decision.  The PCAFC intake, including all assessments, had not been completed prior to the Veteran's death.  Furthermore, final approval and designation did not occur by the time of the Veteran's death, so periodic monthly PCAFC benefits had not been established.

In this case, final approval and designation of the PCAFC benefits did not occur by the time of the Veteran's death, the joint application was not processed, and the applicants were not enrolled in PCAFC.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 1375 (January 9, 2015) (Family Caregiver benefits are effective as of the date that the signed joint application is received by VA or the date the eligible veteran begins receiving care at home (whichever is later), but these benefits are not provided until a Family Caregiver has been designated.  Family Caregivers must complete all required training and instruction to become so designated).

Approval for PCAFC and designation of a Primary Family Caregiver are precluded as a matter of law because the eligible Veteran and Family Caregiver are no longer eligible for benefits.  Therefore, there is no basis upon which to award the benefit sought in this case as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (holding that, where the law and not the evidence is dispositive, the Board should deny the claim on the ground of the lack of legal merit or the lack of entitlement under the law).  The Veteran's death precludes initial eligibility.

As a final matter, the Board notes that the June 2022 denial notification letter is not adequate pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5104.  38 U.S.C. § 1720G(a)(12).  The PCAFC requires VA to notify individuals who apply for the program of decisions affecting the furnishing of assistance with notice as described in 38 U.S.C. § 5104.  38 U.S.C. § 1720G(a)(12).  Generally, notice under 38 U.S.C. § 5104 must include the following: 1) identification of the issues adjudicated; 2) a summary of the evidence considered by the Secretary; 3) a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; 4) identification of findings favorable to the claimant; 5) in the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial; 6) an explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision; 7) if applicable, identification of the criteria that must be satisfied to grant service connection or the next higher level of compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).

However, this error is nonprejudicial and does not warrant remand.  As noted above, the Veteran and Primary Family Caregiver application must be denied as required by regulation.  As such, a remand to correct any deficiency in the notice would not have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim on appeal.  Therefore, remand by the Board for further action by the agency of original jurisdiction is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Board offers its sincere condolences to the Veteran's family and is grateful for his honorable service; however, the Board is bound by law, and its decision is dictated by the relevant statutes and regulations. 

Under these circumstances, there is no potential avenue by which the eligibility requirements for PCAFC benefits could be granted.  Therefore, this appeal must be denied as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

The appeal is denied.
