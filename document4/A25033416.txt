CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral flat feet have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1153, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.304, 3.306. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include adjustment disorder with depressed mood, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active naval service from October 1995 to October 1998. 

This appeal originates from September 2023 rating decision wherein the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for bilateral flat feet and mood swings. In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the September 2023 rating decision. In May 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2023 rating decision. The AOJ continued to deny the claims for service connection for bilateral flat feet and mood swings. 

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in June 2024. He elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, consideration may only be given to the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR in May 2024. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the September 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR in May 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

?

If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of his right to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). 

The June 2024 VA Form 10182 included/listed previously denied claims for service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches, liver spots, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, a low back condition, and anxiety. These issues are not properly before the Board. The May 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal found that a difference of opinion had been asserted with respect to the claims for service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches, and liver spots. These claims were then transferred to the Supplemental Claim lane for additional development. At the time of the June 2024 VA Form 10182, these claims were still pending, and an appealable decision had not yet been issued with respect to the claims for service connection for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches, and liver spots. 

The claims for service connection for adjustment disorder with depressed mood, a low back condition, and anxiety were denied in a March 2021 rating decision. Such was issued more than one year before the receipt of the June 2024 VA Form 10182. Thus, the appeal as to the claims for service connection for adjustment disorder with depressed mood, a low back condition, and anxiety was not timely. However, as discussed in greater detail below, the Veteran's claim for service connection for mood swings has been recharacterized as entitlement to service connection for any acquired psychiatric disorder.

1. Entitlement to Service Connection for Bilateral Flat Feet

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for bilateral flat feet because this condition, which preexisted service, worsened during his active service. 

Veterans shall be considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto and was not aggravated by such service. 38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304; Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Cases in which the condition is noted upon entry into service are governed by the presumption of aggravation of a preexisting disability contained in 38 U.S.C. § 1153 (as opposed to the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C. § 1111, where the complained-of condition was not noted upon entry into service). This statute provides that a preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active service where there is an increase in disability during such service, unless clear and unmistakable evidence shows that the increase in disability is due to the natural progression of the disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306. 

To trigger the application of the presumption of aggravation, the evidence must show that there was an increase in disability during service. See Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096. Where the preexisting disability underwent an increase in severity during service, the burden is on VA to rebut the presumption of aggravation by clear and unmistakable evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b). This includes medical facts and principles which may be considered to determine whether the increase is due to the natural progression of the condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b). 

?

Under these circumstances, the initial burden falls on the Veteran to establish an increase in the severity of the preexisting disability. See Jensen v. Brown, 19 F.3d 1413, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 1994). VA may show a lack of aggravation by establishing with clear and unmistakable evidence that there was no increase in disability during service or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progression of the preexisting condition. Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096; see also Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 235 (2012). Temporary or intermittent flare-ups of a preexisting injury or disease are not sufficient to be considered "aggravation in service" unless the underlying condition itself, as contrasted with mere symptoms, has worsened. See Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1991). 

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claims of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

The Veteran's September 1995 enlistment examination clearly notes the presence of mild, asymptomatic pes planus, or flat feet. He cannot be presumed to have been in sound condition with respect to bilateral flat feet upon his entry into service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1111.  As the Veteran is not presumed to have been in sound condition as to his feet upon his entry into service, the question for the Board is whether his preexisting bilateral flat feet increased in severity during service. For the reasons to follow, the Board concludes that the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's bilateral flat feet worsened during his active service. 

Review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) shows that he did not seek treatment for foot pain or other issues related to the feet during his active service. His July 1998 separation examination does not note the presence of any disabilities of the feet, and his Report of Medical History upon separation did not include reports of foot trouble. The Veteran has not presented any evidence demonstrating that his preexisting bilateral flat feet worsened during his active service. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statement that his bilateral flat feet worsened during his active service and that he experienced pain due to working on the flight deck. While the Veteran is competent to speak to the presence of observable symptoms, he is not competent to opine as to whether such symptoms constituted a worsening of his underlying bilateral flat feet rather than a temporary or intermittent flare-up of the symptoms of this condition. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Further, the Veteran's generic lay statement that his condition worsened during service, without any additional detail or supporting evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that his bilateral flat feet worsened during active service. It is also inconsistent with the evidence of record. As noted above, his STRs fail to show that he complained of issues related to the feet during service, and he also did not report foot issues upon his separation from active service. In short, his report of an increase (worsening) of his bilateral flat feet in service is not credible. 

As the most competent and credible evidence of record does not show an increase in the severity of the Veteran's bilateral flat feet during his active service, the presumption of aggravation does not attach. A discussion of clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut the presumption of aggravation is not required. Thus, entitlement to service connection for bilateral flat feet must be denied. 

2. Entitlement to Service Connection for an Acquired Psychiatric Disorder (Claimed as Mood Swings)

The Veteran seeks service connection for a psychiatric condition, claimed as mood swings, that he relates to exposure to jet fuel during active service. He has also previously sought service connection for anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as related to experiences during boot camp. The record further establishes that he was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with depressed mood during the January 2021 VA examination. As such, the Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claim as entitlement to service connection for any acquired psychiatric disorder pursuant to Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009). 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

That Board again acknowledges that the Veteran has previously sought service connection for PTSD. However, the Veteran's treatment records do not show a diagnosis of PTSD. Although treatment records from November 2022 show that the Veteran has a "history" of PTSD, this is based on self-reports, and there are no other treatment records showing a diagnosis of PTSD under the DSM-V criteria. The January 2021 VA examiner also explained that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-V criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, as neither his stressor nor his symptoms met the criteria. A diagnosis of PTSD under the DSM-V criteria is required for the purposes of granting service connection. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304(f), 4.125. 

However, as noted, the January 2021 VA examination shows a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood. The May 2024 rating decision on appeal also included the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood. This favorable finding is binding on the Board, and the first element of direct service connection is met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 3.303(d). 

As for the second element of service connection, the Veteran described events related to extreme yelling and peer pressure from drill instructors during basic training. He also reports that his mood swings are related to jet fuel exposure during service. 

?

The Veteran's STRs are silent for complaints related to psychiatric symptoms during service. However, his reports of yelling and pressure from drill instructors during boot camp are consistent with the duties and circumstances of his service. The Board finds no basis to question the credibility of the Veteran's statements regarding these in-service events. The Veteran report that he was exposed to jet fuel is also consistent with the circumstances of his service. Review of his personnel records shows that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was electrical/mechanical equipment repairman. The August 2023 toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) memorandum shows that the Veteran was exposed to solvents, grease, oil, fuel, exhaust, and smoke due to his MOS. Based on the foregoing, the second Shedden element has been met. 381 F.3d at 1166-67. 

Thus, the question for the Board becomes whether the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder, to include adjustment disorder with depressed mood, is etiologically related to his active naval service. 

In the January 2021 VA medical opinion, the examiner stated that the Veteran's adjustment disorder with depressed mood is at least as likely as not related to his experiences during his active service. The January 2021 VA examiner did not provide a rationale for this opinion, so she was asked to provide an addendum opinion in March 2021. In the addendum opinion, the examiner stated that the Veteran dealt with yelling and screaming in boot camp by drill instructors. This has led to low self-esteem, questioning himself, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. She stated that the Veteran has not sought mental health treatment for these symptoms, and the Veteran reported that he has not let his depression led to any significant problems with occupational or social functioning and has tried to cope with his symptoms on his own. However, she stated that he has internalized his feelings and has adjustment disorder with depressed mood because of these experiences with drill sergeants. The Veteran felt picked on and still feels bad about himself due to these in-service experiences. 

The Board finds this opinion to be probative, especially because it is based upon full consideration of the Veteran's medical records. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007). The available record also contains no medical opinions contradicting the findings of the January 2021 and March 2021 VA medical opinion. 

Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence is at least in approximate equipoise as to whether the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder had its onset during or is related to his active naval service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include adjustment disorder with depressed mood, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
