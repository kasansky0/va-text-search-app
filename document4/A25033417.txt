ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine condition is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine condition is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition, to include osteoarthritis, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's cervical spine condition is the result of injury sustained in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) while returning from inactive duty training (IDT).

2. The Veteran's lumbar spine condition is the result of injury sustained in a MVA while returning from IDT.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a cervical spine condition are met. 10 U.S.C. §§ 12503, 12552; 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 106(d), 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.6, 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for a lumbar spine condition are met. 10 U.S.C. §§ 12503, 12552; 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 106(d), 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.6, 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran was a member of the U.S. Navy Reserves from January 1991 to January 2003 and from August 2003 to August 2012 and participated in several periods of active duty for training (ADT) and IDT during that time. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the May 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

In January 2025, the Veteran was notified that since she appeared to submit additional evidence and/or statements with her May 2023 VA Form 10182, in order for the Board to consider any additional evidence she would have to request to switch her AMA docket selection from direct review to evidence submission or hearing.  The Veteran was notified in order to complete such action, she would have to provide a new VA Form 10182 with the new docket choice, evidence or hearing. She was notified that typically AMA docket changes had to be filed within 60 days of the date the Board received the original VA Form 10182 or within one year of the VA decision being appealed, whichever is later.  However, as she was beyond both dates, she was notified that she could submit an extension request to file the VA Form 10182 with evidence of good cause.  

The Veteran submitted a new VA Form 10182 in February 2025 electing the evidence submission docket, but it did not contain an accompanying extension request based on good cause. Therefore, the Board shall proceed with review of the appeal under the direct docket.  The Board would note that such action is not prejudicial to the Veteran as the evidence was either duplicative of what was already of record or not relevant to the matters on appeal.  Moreover, two issues (service connection for cervical and lumbar spine conditions) are full grants of the benefits sought on appeal and the third issue (service connection for left knee condition), any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine condition is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine condition is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a cervical and lumbar spine conditions, which she contends are the result of a MVA she was involved in while returning from performing funeral honors duty in December 2007. See, e.g., October 2022 Supplemental Claim and Statement in Support of Claim; June 2023 Written Brief Presentation.

Generally, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

A person seeking compensation benefits must first establish that they are a veteran. Gardner v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 415, 418-19 (2009). A veteran, for purposes of VA benefits, is defined as a "person who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service, and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable." 38 U.S.C. § 101(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(d).

The phrase "active military, naval, air, or space service" includes active duty or any period of active duty for training (ADT) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while performing ADT. 38 U.S.C. § 101(24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a). The phrase also includes any period of inactive duty training (IDT) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty or from acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or cerebrovascular accident which occurred during such IDT. Id. Active service for ADT or IDT also includes authorized travel directly to or from such duty. 38 U.S.C. § 106(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(e).

ADT includes full time duty performed by a member of the Reserves. 38 U.S.C. § 101(22)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6(c). IDT includes duty other than full time duty performed by a member of the Reserves. 38 U.S.C. § 101(23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(d). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA will resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

An initial matter applicable to all three claims is the classification of the funeral honors duty performed by the Veteran on the date of the MVA in December 2007. VA statutes and regulations do not specifically categorize funeral honors duty for the purpose of VA compensation.

However, title 10 of the United States Code provides clarification. Specifically, 10 U.S.C. § 12503(a) provides that "[a] member of the Ready Reserve may be ordered to funeral honors duty, with the consent of the member, in preparation for or to perform funeral honors functions at the funeral of a veteran as defined in [10 U.S.C. § 1491]" and that performance of funeral honors duty by a Reserve member not on active duty shall be treated as inactive duty training (including with respect to travel to and from such duty) for purposes of any provision of law other than sections 206 and 495 of title 37 of the United States Code. The Board notes that sections 206 and 495 of title 37 relate to basic pay for inactive duty training and travel allowance. Thus, the plain language of the statute indicates that funeral honors duty shall be treated as inactive duty training for any other provision of law. 

The Board notes that 10 U.S.C. § 12552 provides that performance by a Reserve of funeral honors functions at the funeral of a veteran as defined in section 1491(h) of this title may not be considered to be a period of drill or training but may be performed as funeral honors duty under section 12503 of this title.  While §§ 12503 and 12552 may appear to be at odds, as the former indicates that funeral honors duty is considered inactive duty training and the latter indicates that it is not considered a period of drill or training, the legislative history of § 12552 provides clarification.  When § 12552 was enacted, it provided that performance by a Reserve of honor guard functions at a funeral of a veteran would not be considered a period of drill or training otherwise required.  See P.L. 105-261, 112 Stat. 1920 (Oct. 17, 1998).  Therefore, the original purpose of §12552 was to distinguish funeral honors functions performed by a Reserve member from drill or training requirements that were otherwise required.  When §§ 12503 and 12552 are read together, the meaning is clear.  The performance of funeral honors functions by a Reserve member is not considered a period of drill or training as may be required by his/her unit, but rather as separate category defined by § 12503.  Thus, while the Veteran's funeral honors duty was not considered "drill" or "training" in terms of her Reserve requirements, the law requires that it be treated as if it were IDT. 

Accordingly, funeral honors duty is considered IDT for the purpose of this appeal.

In the April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found the Veteran has cervical (neck) and lumbar spine disabilities. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

With regard to the other elements of service connection, resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds the Veteran's neck and back injuries were the result of the MVA occurring in December 2007 while the Veteran traveled directly from funeral honors duty, which constitutes IDT for the reason discussed above.

First, the evidence of record prior to the MVA indicates the Veteran had a "normal" spine. See, e.g., January 1992 and January 2002 Reports of Medical Examination in service treatment records (STRs). Before the MVA, STRs similarly reflect the Veteran reported no recurrent back pain or any back injury. See, e.g., January 2002 Report of Medical History.

Next, the evidence shows the Veteran's funeral honors duty and the MVA took place on the same date and in close temporal succession in December 2007. See December 2007 Funeral Detail Information Sheet (reflecting the Veteran as among the participating personnel at a 30 minute service scheduled to begin at 2:30 p.m.); see also December 2007 report of Florida Highway Patrol (reflecting the time of crash as 3:45 p.m.).

Finally, the evidence supports that the Veteran's neck and back injuries were caused by the MVA. While the Veteran did not go to the emergency room immediately following the accident, she sought treatment from her primary care physician (PCP) on the day after the accident. During that visit, the Veteran reported back and cervical spine pain and muscle spasms as a result of the MVA on the day prior. See December 2007 private treatment record. Private treatment records that follow also reflect continued treatment, including physical therapy for the back and neck conditions (ongoing) and surgical intervention for the neck condition (July 2008).

The findings above are supported by the Approval of Line of Duty Benefits granted for back and neck pain incurred while on IDT by the Navy Personnel Command of the Department of the Navy in January 2008.

The Board notes that the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for these conditions in November 2022. In the medical opinions rendered in connection with the exam, the examiner opined these conditions were less likely than not incurred in or caused by service. However, as the rationale for this conclusion in each opinion, the examiner noted that although there is evidence of a 2007 MVA, "VADIR reveals [Veteran] was inactive at the time and not serving active duty." The Board finds these negative nexus opinions to be of no probative value because they did not consider the Veteran's funeral honors duty and, therefore, her IDT status, at the time of the accident. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 (1993) (medical opinion based on inaccurate factual premise may properly be rejected as non-probative).

Accordingly, resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for cervical and lumbar spine conditions is warranted by the probative evidence of record, and the appeal is therefore granted with respect to those claims. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition, to include osteoarthritis, is remanded.

The Veteran also seeks service connection for a left knee condition, which she contends was the result of the December 2007 MVA she was involved in while returning from performing funeral honors duty, and so while on IDT. See, e.g., October 2022 Supplemental Claim and Statement in Support of Claim.

In the April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found the Veteran has a left knee disability based on a diagnosis of knee joint osteoarthritis. However, with regard to the other elements of service connection, the Board is unable to make a fully informed decision on the Veteran's claim because the medical evidence of record is not adequate for adjudication.

STRs from March 2006, more than a year before the MVA at issue, show the Veteran complained of left knee pain while performing funeral honors duty. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings from March 2006 reflect mild ACL mucoid degenerative signal changes and a possible mild ACL sprain, mild multicompartment osteoarthritic changes, and a large popliteal cyst.

In August 2006, the Veteran underwent a left knee arthroplasty procedure, including to address "major articular cartilage derangement of both the patella and femoral surfaces." August 2006 Operative Report.

On the day after the December 2007 MVA, the Veteran complained of back and neck pain to her PCP with Coastal Primary Care and began treatment for those conditions (discussed above), although the Veteran's past surgical history of the left knee also was noted at that visit. 

At a two week follow up visit with Coastal Primary Care, also in December 2007, the Veteran complained of left knee pain, swelling, and stiffness, which she described as "worsening ever since the accident." The clinician's assessment at that visit reflects left knee pain and contusion and a history of arthritis and cartilage damage, and notes, without further elaboration, "exacerbation of previous history vs. new injury." Subsequent treatment records reflect ongoing physical therapy for the neck, back, and knee. See, e.g., February 2008 Physical Therapy Weekly/Progress Note.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for the knee condition in November 2022. As discussed above, in the medical opinions rendered in connection with the November 2022 exam, including for the knee condition, the examiner opined these conditions were less likely than not incurred in or caused by service, because the Veteran was inactive and not serving on active duty at the time of the MVA. As above, the Board finds this negative nexus opinion to be of no probative value because it did not consider the Veteran's funeral honors duty and, therefore, her IDT status, at the time of the accident. See Reonal, 5 Vet. App. at 460-61. Further, it is not clear whether the examiner considered the Veteran's history of knee pain and treatment prior to the MVA in rendering the opinion. 

A remand is therefore necessary to obtain a medical opinion on the etiology of the Veteran's left knee condition in order to correct a pre-decisional error in the duty to assist. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311-12 (2007) (stating that once VA undertakes the effort to provide a veteran with a medical examination, the examination must be adequate).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's currently diagnosed left knee condition, to include osteoarthritis. An in-person VA examination need not be scheduled unless deemed necessary by the examiner or otherwise required by the evidence. The complete claims file and a copy of this Remand must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner. Thereafter, the examiner must provide a fully articulated medical opinion addressing the following:

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the currently present diagnosis had its onset during the Veteran's active service or is otherwise etiologically related to such service?

Specifically, the examiner should consider and address whether the Veteran's current left knee condition was the result of injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, to include the motor vehicle accident (MVA) that occurred while the Veteran was returning from funeral honors duty in December 2007, which is treated as inactive duty training (IDT) for VA compensation purposes.

In rendering the opinion, particularly with respect to aggravation, the examiner also should consider and address the medical evidence of record 

?

regarding the Veteran's left knee prior to the December 2007 MVA.
