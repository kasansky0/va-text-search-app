ORDER

Because this appeal comes from a rating reduction proposal, the appeal is premature, and it is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. This appeal comes from a May 2024 rating decision that proposed a rating reduction from 50 percent to 30 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

2. At the time of the relevant notice of disagreement, the reduction had not been finally implemented. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There is no question of law or fact on appeal. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 ; 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 20.104, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2004 to October 2011.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals from a May 2024 rating decision that proposed a reduction in the rating for PTSD.

In his September 2024 VA Form 10182 (notice of disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 14, 2024 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the May 14, 2024 AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The May 2024 rating decision also denied service connection for bronchitis, right hip, and back (spinal arthritis). The Veteran filed a May 2024 VA Form 20-0996 (request for higher-level review) referencing the May 2024 decision. 05/28/2024, VA Form 20-0996. Subsequently, the Veteran referenced the same issues in his September 2024 VA Form 10182. In this matter, the Veteran's September 2024 VA Form 10182 is invalid regarding the claims of service connection for bronchitis, right hip, and back conditions, as the Veteran has not withdrawn his Higher-Level Review request for this matter pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(d), which remains pending. Under these circumstances, the VA Form 10182 constituted a concurrent election of a review option, which is prohibited by 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). 

Additionally, a January 2023 rating decision denied service connection for allergies, non-specific respiratory condition, and sinusitis. The Veteran referenced these issues in his September 2024 VA Form 10182. The Board finds that the attempted appeal of the January 2023 rating decision was not timely. The modernized review system (or AMA) became effective February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2. The AMA creates a new framework for veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review and is applicable to all claims initially decided after that date. A claimant must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the AOJ within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b). Here, the September 2024 VA Form 10182 was not filed within a year of notice of the January 2023 rating decision. As such, this does not follow proper claims-processing rules. 

In Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (en banc), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) held the one-year deadline to file a legacy notice of disagreement (NOD) is not a jurisdictional bar to Board review, but a mandatory claims-processing rule. However, this case is distinguishable from Ferko. In Ferko, the Veteran filed his legacy NOD only two weeks after the one-year deadline had expired, and he presented extenuating circumstances as to why his NOD should be accepted. Id. Pursuant to the authority given in Section 7105(c), 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) permits the Board to accept untimely NODs where good cause has been shown. The regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b), states, in pertinent part, that time limits within which claimants or beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown. Here, the Veteran did not present good cause or extenuating circumstances as to why it could not be filed earlier. As proper claims-processing rules were not followed, and as no valid exception exists as to why this appeal warrants adjudication, the Board concludes that it must dismiss the Veteran's attempted appeal of the January 2023 rating decision.

***

The Veteran is appealing the May 2024 rating decision that proposed a rating reduction from 50 percent to 30 percent for PTSD. VA received the Veteran's September 2024 VA Form 10182 several months before notice of the January 2025 rating decision that implemented a reduction, effective April 1, 2025, was sent to the Veteran.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. In this case, the decision on appeal is a proposed reduction, not an actual or finalized reduction. The Board does not review  decisions that propose to reduce disability evaluations as there has been no adjudication by the AOJ that either allows or disallows a benefit sought. It reviews decisions that effectuate a reduction to a disability evaluation. Therefore, the appeal of this issue is premature and not properly before the Board for consideration. As there is no question of law or fact, the appeal for the proposed reduction is dismissed.

The Veteran, however, is not without recourse. Indeed, the record shows that he did disagree with the rating reduction implemented by the January 2025 rating decision, and submitted a request for review of this rating decision under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a) via a February 20, 2025 VA Form 10182 and selected the Board's Evidence docket (docket #250220-525986).
