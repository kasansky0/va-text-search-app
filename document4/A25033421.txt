DOCKET NO. 241028-488004
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal seeking service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On December 16, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in June 2019, from July to August 2020, from September 2020 to October 2021, and from July to August 2022, with additional service in the Reserve.  

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from an October 2024 rating decision by a VA Regional Office.  In an October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Docket.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn by an appellant, or his or her representative, as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Appeal withdrawals must include the name of the veteran, the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Id.

In December 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, requesting to withdraw his October 2024 appeal in which he sought service connection for sleep apnea.  The statement included the Veteran's name, the VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  As there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal.  The appeal is therefore dismissed. 

The Board notes that VA is currently processing the Veteran's supplemental claim for the aforementioned issue which will not be affected by this Board decision.
