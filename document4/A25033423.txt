ORDER

As new and relevant evidence has been submitted, readjudication of the claim for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is warranted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for OSA, to include as secondary to service-connected disabilities, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

New evidence was received after the June 2023 denial that is relevant to the claim for entitlement to service connection for OSA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudicating the claim for entitlement to service connection for OSA have been met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2008 to March 2019. 

The Veteran filed an original disability claim in May 2023, which was denied by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in June 2023. In November 2023, the Veteran filed a VA 20-0996, higher level review (HLR) appeal, and in April 2024, the AOJ found a duty to assist (DTA) error. In August 2024, after completing development related to the DTA error, the AOJ issued a rating decision denial. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for OSA, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

New and Material Evidence

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). New evidence is existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers, while relevant evidence is evidence that tends to prove or disprove the matter at issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

Whether new and relevant evidence was received to warrant readjudication of the May 2023 claim for entitlement to service connection for OSA. 

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for OSA in May 2023. In a June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied the claim. 

In December 2023, the Veteran filed a VA 20-0996, HLR appeal, and in April 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision, favorably finding that the Veteran had a current disability of OSA, and the Veteran had a primarily service-connected disability of unspecified anxiety disorder. Additionally, the AOJ found there was a DTA error, for not requesting a medical opinion, regarding whether the Veteran's OSA was secondarily or proximately service connected to the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder. See April 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative. 

In May 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination, regarding whether the Veteran's OSA was secondarily service connected to the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder. This evidence was not previously of record and may prove or disprove the matter at issue. Therefore, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been received and readjudication of the Veteran's service connection claim for OSA is warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for OSA, to include as secondary to service-connected disabilities, is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for OSA, which he generally contends is secondary to his service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder and/or etiologically related to service. 

The Board notes that VA's General Counsel has recognized that obesity may serve as an "intermediate step" between a primary service-connected disability and a claimed disability for the purposes of establishing service connection on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. Moreover, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that obesity as an "intermediate step" in a causal chain for service connection can be established on either a causal or aggravation basis. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020).

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for tension headaches at 50 percent; bilateral shoulder strain at 20 percent; lumbosacral strain at 20 percent; left wrist sprain at 20 percent; and left knee strain at 10 percent; all from March 9, 2019; bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy at 10 percent from December 23, 2021; and unspecified anxiety disorder at 30 percent from June 17, 2022. Further, the Veteran has a combined evaluation for disability rating of 80 percent from March 9, 2019, and 90 percent, from December 23, 2021. See August 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet. 

The AOJ obtained a medical opinion in June 2023. The VA examiner cited to a medical reference book, and provided, "OSA is caused by anatomical structure abnormalities. The Veteran's present BMI is 31. This BMI places the Veteran in the obese range. Obesity is the leading cause of OSA. Therefore, it is my medical opinion that the claimed condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness." The examiner found that the primary cause and contributor to OSA is obesity. The Veteran reported onset of OSA from 2011, and poor sleep for 12 years, due to working night and swing shift in service, which has progressed or worsened, since, manifesting as symptoms of snoring, gasping for air, and apneic episodes. Lastly, for treatment of his OSA, the Veteran takes amitriptyline and uses a CPAP machine. The examiner did not discuss whether the Veteran's obesity was caused or aggravated his any of his service-connected conditions. See June 2023 C&P Exam. 

Because the opinion did not address whether the Veteran's OSA was proximately or secondarily service-connected to the Veteran's service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder, the AOJ obtained an addendum opinion from a different examiner in May 2024. The examiner also opined that the Veteran's OSA is less likely than not proximately due to his service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder. The examiner did not provide any rationale other than to state that there is no medical literature to support such a relationship and cited to the same medical reference book, as the June 2023 VA examiner. 

The Board finds that neither the June 2023 or May 2024 VA medical opinions are adequate to fairly resolve the Veteran's claim as they do not properly address the Veteran's contention that his unspecified anxiety disorder, caused or aggravated his OSA. 

Moreover, when a theory of entitlement is raised by the record, the Board must consider it. See Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Additionally, the Board must address all issues and theories reasonably raised by the claimant or the evidence. Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008), aff'd sub nom. Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  

Further, in assorted VA examinations, the Veteran has described his functional limitations, stating he has pain on range of motion function in his right wrist, bilateral shoulders, and in his lumbar spine, upon, walking, standing, and sitting. See November and December 2018 C&P Exams; see also January 2022 C&P Exam. 

In VA treatment records, the Veteran had a noted history of utilizing the prescription medication, amitriptyline, for pain, sleep, or mood, having been prescribed it in December 2018; from December 2020 to June 2021; and from February 2022 to July 2022. See May and November 2023 CAPRI. 

In November 2018, the Veteran was noted as having a BMI of 29.5, in June 2022, the Veteran was noted as having a BMI of 31.1, in July 2022, it was noted the Veteran was overweight and had gained between 20 to 25 pounds in the preceding year, in September 2022, and April 2023, the Veteran was noted as overweight, in May 2023, the Veteran was advised on diet and exercise for weight loss, in June 2023, the Veteran had a reported BMI of 31, and lastly, in October 2023, the Veteran had a noted BMI of 30.9. See November 2018 and June 2023 C&P Exams; see also September 2022 and May 2023 CAPRI. 

The June 2023 or May 2024 VA medical opinions did not consider the reasonably raised theories of whether obesity may act as an intermediate step, or whether any medications the Veteran was taking for any service-connected conditions, may have caused or aggravated his weight gain and/or obesity, which in turn, caused or aggravated his OSA. 

In light of the above, the Board finds that while the AOJ took steps to obtain VA medical opinions on the Veteran's behalf prior to issuing the rating decision on appeal, it did not ensure that the medical opinions obtained were adequate for the purposes of the determination being made. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). This constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and, on remand, an adequate opinion must be obtained prior to adjudication of the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Accordingly, the matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum medical opinion from a qualified VA physician (M.D.) addressing the nature and etiology of the Veteran's OSA. An in-person examination need not be scheduled unless deemed necessary by the examiner or otherwise required by the evidence. The examiner must review the claims file in its entirety, to include a copy of this REMAND, and that review must be noted in the report. Thereafter, the examiner must provide a fully articulated medical opinion addressing the following: 

(a)	Is it at least as likely as not (i.e., the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA is caused by his service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder and/or musculoskeletal disabilities, to include any medications used to treat his disabilities and/or any resultant weight gain/obesity?

(b)	Is it at least as likely as not (i.e., the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA is aggravated by his service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder and/or musculoskeletal disabilities, to include any medications used to treat his disabilities and/or any resultant weight gain/obesity?

The examiner should note that VA has recognized that obesity may qualify as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability, and any opinion offered must adequately consider and discuss this theory of entitlement.

The examiner must provide separate opinions addressing causation and aggravation. In addressing the matter of aggravation, the examiner is reminded that it is not required that the claimed disability is shown to be aggravated predominantly or permanently by the service-connected disability, but rather, whether there is any contributing degree of aggravation beyond natural progression by that disability.

The opinion must specifically consider and discuss the following evidence:

The Veteran's description of his functional limitations related to his musculoskeletal disabilities; specifically, the November 2018, December 2018, and January 2022 C&P Exams, where the Veteran reported pain on range of motion function in his right wrist, bilateral shoulders, and lumbar spine, upon, walking, standing, and/or sitting. See November and December 2018 C&P Exams; see also January 2022 C&P Exam.  

The Veteran's BMI and notations of being overweight, in November 2018, noted a BMI of 29.5; in June 2022, noted a BMI of 31.1; in July 2022, noted as overweight and 20-to-25-pound weight gain, in the preceding year; in September 2022, and April 2023, noted as overweight, in May 2023, advised on diet and exercise for weight loss, in June 2023, noted a BMI of 31; in October 2023, noted a BMI of 30.9. See November 2018 and June 2023 C&P Exams; see also September 2022 and May 2023 CAPRI. 

The Veteran's noted history of utilizing the prescription medication, amitriptyline, for pain, sleep, and/or mood, in December 2018; from December 2020 to June 2021; from February 2022 to July 2022; and in the June 2023 C&P Exam. See also May 2023 and November 2023 CAPRI. 

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for any opinions offered, citing to the examiner's own expertise, medical principals, and/or evidence in the Veteran's claims file, when necessary, to support the conclusion reached. If an opinion cannot be reached without resorting to speculation, the examiner must fully explain why that is so.
