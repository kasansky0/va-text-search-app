CONCLUSION OF LAW

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024, decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  

In his March 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. Payment or Reimbursement for the Cost of Non-VA Prescriptions 

The Veteran seeks reimbursement in the amount of $86.45 for prescriptions related to non-VA treatment that he received at St. Francis Hospital from December 27, 2023, to December 29, 2023  See April 2024 VA Form 10182.  The Veteran stated he sought treatment for pneumonia at Newington VA Urgent Care center and was transported to St. Francis Hospital due to a lack of available beds at the VA Hospital.  Id.  

Pertinent Statutory and Regulatory Requirements

Payment or reimbursement for private emergency medical treatment may be considered under 38 U.S.C. § 1725.  The primary requirements for payment or reimbursement under this statute are that the Veteran is treated in an emergency department or similar facility held out as providing emergency treatment to the public; the treatment received is for a condition of such a nature that a prudent layperson would have reasonably expected that delay in seeking immediate medical attention would have been hazardous to life or health; and a VA or other federal facility was not feasibly available to provide the treatment.  38 C.F.R. § 17.1002(a-c).  A condition that a prudent layperson would reasonably expect that delay in seeking medical attention would be hazardous to life or health can include one manifested by severe pain that results in serious dysfunction of the body.  38 C.F.R. § 17.1002(b).

The implementing regulation for 38 C.F.R. § 17.1002 states that payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. 1725 for emergency treatment (including medical services, professional services, ambulance services, ancillary care and medication (including a short course of medication related to and necessary for the treatment of the emergency condition that is provided directly to or prescribed for the patient for use after the emergency condition is stabilized and the patient is discharged)) will be made only if certain following conditions are met.  

Factual Background

On December 27, 2023, the 87-year-old Veteran presented to the Newington VA urgent care with complaints of generalized weakness and fatigue with nausea and cough productive of phlegm.  See December 2023 VA Urgent Care Note in CAPRI received April 2024.  He was subsequently transferred to a non-VA facility (St. Francis Hospital) to receive appropriate level of care required.  See December 2023 VA Inter-Facility Transfer and Referral Note in CAPRI received April 2024.

The St. Francis Hospital emergency discharge notes indicate the Veteran was diagnosed with pneumonia and was prescribed azithromycin, cefpodoxime, fluticasone, and sodium chloride.  See December 2023 Private Treatment Record from St. Francis Hospital.  The St. Francis after visit (discharge) summary was printed at 2:05 pm on Friday, December 29, 2023.  Id.

The Veteran reported that he was seen at Newington VA urgent care and was diagnosed with pneumonia in December 2023.  See February 2024 Email Correspondence.  He further states, "hospitalization was determined necessary, and NO beds were available to the VA West Haven facility I was ambulanced to St. Francis Hospital where I was admitted."  Id. (emphasis in the original).  He was discharged two days later with instructions to pick up medications prescribed by the St. Francis emergency doctors.  Id.  Finally, the Veteran contends that "no meds available [at] VA pharmacy.  After hours."  See April 2024 VA Form 10182.  The receipt from CVS indicates that the prescription was picked up at approximately at 5:00 pm.  See Medical Receipts.  

Analysis

Based on a review of the record, and affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that payment or reimbursement for prescription medication associated with the non-VA emergency treatment on December 29, 2023, is warranted under 38 U.S.C. § 1725.

Here, the Board finds the instant appeal involves medication prescribed during non-VA emergency treatment at a private medical facility.  As noted above, the Veteran was transferred to the private medical facility by VA.  The available treatment records confirm that the Veteran was diagnosed with pneumonia and Veteran was prescribed medication upon discharge.  Thus, the Board finds that prescription medication was a necessary part of the non-VA emergency treatment.

Considering the above-mentioned facts, the Board finds that the non-VA prescription medication was a necessary part of the non-VA emergency treatment on December 29, 2023; services were rendered due to an emergency within the local geographical area; VA was timely notified of the non-VA treatment; the services met the prudent layperson definition of an emergency; and a VA facility was not feasibly available.  There are additional criteria that must also be met to authorize payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. § 1725.  However, there is no indication that the Veteran failed to meet any of these additional criteria.  38 C.F.R. § 17.1002(d)-(h).
