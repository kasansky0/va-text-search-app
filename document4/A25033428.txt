ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to major depressive disorder, with anxious distress, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record is at least in approximate balance or nearly equal that the Veteran's sleep apnea condition, to include as secondary to major depressive disorder, with anxious distress, had its onset in or is otherwise etiologically related to military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to major depressive disorder, with anxious distress, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1154(a), 5103, 5103A, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310, 3.326, 3.655, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.41

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 1969 to August 1971, to include boots on the ground service in the Republic of Vietnam.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  Following a June 2023 request for higher-level review and an August 2024 rating decision, this timely appeal of the denial followed.  

In the March 2025 notice of disagreement, the Veteran indicated: "Evidence Submission reviewed by a Veterans Law Judge: I have additional evidence in support of my claim that I will submit to the Board within the 90 days of the Board's receipt of my VA Form 10182." 

To better explain the docket choice in the VA Form 10182, "evidence submission" means that the Board's decision must be based solely on evidence already of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal and any evidence submitted by the veteran or his or her representative either with the notice of disagreement or within 90 days following receipt of the notice of disagreement.  Therefore, the Board is ordinarily bound to an evidentiary window that closed June 10, 2025.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

However, the Board will also rely on the VA medical examination completed in August 2024 as the basis for the grant of service connection for the following reasons.

First, the period on appeal does not correspond to the "evidentiary windows" (those periods when evidence may properly be received under the AMA) because evidence received outside of the evidentiary window may nonetheless pertain to the claimant's condition before the evidence window closed.  

In a case of service connection such as this, it is crucial to distinguish between period on appeal and evidentiary window because a medical examiner would likely arrive at the same conclusion regarding nexus based on a condition "proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury" and the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric condition, regardless of when the medical evidence was reviewed or when the opinion was provided.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).

Indeed, the October 2020 and November 2023 VA medical examiners both acknowledged a "relationship between OSA and MDD."  See October 2020 and November 2023 VA Sleep Apnea examination reports.  Therefore, the Board finds that it is appropriate to consider the August 2024 VA medical examination insofar as it sheds light on the Veteran's overlapping acquired psychiatric condition and sleep apnea symptoms during the entire period on appeal.  See Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ("[A] veteran's disability must be evaluated in light of its whole recorded history.").

Second, in Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021), the Court held:

[A] claims-processing rule, even if unalterable on a party's application, does not reduce the adjudicatory domain of a tribunal and is ordinarily forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point...[T]hey do not affect subject matter jurisdiction, claims-processing provisions generally are binding when properly asserted and not forfeited, and so they differ from jurisdictional rules, which are not subject to waiver or forfeiture....

See Hall, supra.  There is no question regarding the Board's jurisdiction to consider the matters raised by the Veteran in his March 2025 notice of disagreement.  However, the rules regarding the selection of an appeal lane under the AMA are akin to claim-processing rules, and the Board has a duty to construe the substantive appeals of unrepresented appellants liberally and sympathetically, which is the case here.  See Smith v. McDonough, U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1460*; Drummond v. Hunter, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 135*. 

Third, as the Court held in Bolds v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 259 (2024):

[T]he Court must presume that statutory provisions are subject to waiver by voluntary agreement of the parties.  This includes non-jurisdictional claims-processing rules, even mandatory ones, that the govern the processing of cases...38 U.S.C. § 7113(b)'s and 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a)'s evidence submission limits are claim-processing rules subject to Secretarial waiver....

See Bolds, supra.  As the Board can waive "evidence submission limits," it does so regarding the August 2024 VA medical examination evidence and will include the report as part of the available record in deciding the Veteran's appeal for service connection of a sleep apnea condition.

Finally, as the Court held in Johnson v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 383*, to deny the claims for service connection of a sleep apnea condition, only to ask the Veteran to resubmit an application for benefits would "result in unnecessary delay, erect hurdles in veteran's paths, and result in a waste of administrative resources."  Therefore, the Board will not unnecessarily delay the award of benefits where the requirements for service connection have been met.

The Board notes that it has thoroughly reviewed the record in conjunction with this case.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that "absent specific evidence indicating otherwise," VA is presumed to have reviewed all evidence in the record when deciding a case.).  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases for its decisions, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the entire body of evidence.  See Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143, 149 (2001) (holding that the Board is not required to discuss all the evidence of record but rather it must address the relevant evidence.); see also Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 593 (1991) (38 U.S.C. § 7104 requires the Board to address all regulations that are made "potentially applicable through the assertions and issues raised in the record.").  Any failure by the Board to mention evidence in its decision does not trigger a presumption that it was not considered.  See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

Any evidence that was not considered by the Board in this AMA decision may be resubmitted along with a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995).  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  If that evidence, or any new evidence the Veteran wishes to submit with his supplemental claim, is relevant to the issue of service connection for these disabilities, the VA will readjudicate it.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501; Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

The matter is now before the Board for consideration. 

This case has been advanced on the docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C § 7107(b) and 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to major depressive disorder, with anxious distress.

Service Connection

Generally, service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

To establish entitlement to service connection, there must be: (1) competent and credible evidence confirming the Veteran has the claimed disability or at least has since filing the claim; (2) competent and credible evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a relevant disease or injury; and (3) competent and credible evidence of a nexus or link between the in-service injury or disease and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1113(b) (2014); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d) (2016).  

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § § 3.310(a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) proximately caused by or (b) proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability.  See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc).

Analysis

Concerning the first element of service connection, the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability.  See October 2020 VA Sleep Apnea examination report, February 2021 Apnix Polysomnogram Report, April 2022 St. Luke's The Woodlands Hospital Split Night Polysomnography Report, November 2023 VA Sleep Apnea examination report, and August 2024 VA Sleep Apnea examination report.  The first element of service connection is satisfied.

Regarding an in-service event, service treatment records for the Veteran are silent for complaints of, treatment for, or a diagnosis related to a sleep disorder.  See August 1969 to August 1971 Veteran service treatment records, July 1971 Report of Medical Examination, July 1971 Report of Medical History, and August 1971 Statement of Medical Condition. 

However, since the Veteran's original claim for service connection in April 2020, he has claimed service connection secondary to his service-connected acquired psychiatric condition.  Therefore, as mentioned above, he need only show that his sleep apnea was proximately caused by or proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability.

Pursuant to a duty to assist, the Veteran was provided with a VA medical examination in August 2024.  The examiner reviewed the claims file and evidence of record in preparation for her report.  The Veteran was examined in person, and his statements were considered.  Regarding secondary service connection, the examiner concluded: "The claimed condition is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) proximately due to or the result of the veteran's service-connected condition," adding, "According to medical literature 'depression and anxiety, especially co-occurrence of both greatly, were associated with an increased risk of OSA.'"  See August 2024 VA Sleep Apnea examination report; see also October 2020 and November 2023 VA Sleep Apnea examination reports.

Therefore, the second element required for secondary service connection is satisfied.

Conclusion

In summary, the evidence of record is at least in approximate balance or nearly equal that the Veteran's sleep apnea condition had its onset in or is otherwise etiologically related to military service. 

But for his service-connected acquired psychiatric condition, the Veteran would not have the symptoms associated with sleep apnea.  See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023), describing "caused by" as simple but for causation, a not only broad but even "sweeping" concept that requires unbroken links in the causal chain); see also El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136 (2012).

Having satisfied the required elements for secondary service connection and resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for a sleep apnea condition is warranted, and the appeal is hereby granted.
