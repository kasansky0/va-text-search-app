CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment for non-VA dental services provided on January 14, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, Kenan Clinton DDS, is a non-VA dental provider that furnished dental services to the Veteran on January 14, 2020.?

In December 2020, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Evidence Submission docket to review decisions issued by a VA Medical Center for the January 14, 2020, episode of care.

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA dental care provided to the Veteran on January 14, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  In a July 2021 letters, VA informed the appellant and the Veteran that this episode of care had been approved on secondary administrative review and that claims regarding this episode of care would be processed according to VA policy.  In addition, the record reflects that $1,121.18 had been paid for the January 14, 2020, episode of care.  See January 2021 letter to the Veteran.  

The Board acknowledges that the payment may be less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care.  If the amount paid for the January 14, 2020, episode of care is disagreeable to the appellant, they may file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the January 14, 2020, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the prior denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
