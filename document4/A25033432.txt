ORDER

Beginning March 9, 2011, a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

REMANDED

For the period prior to March 9, 2011, entitlement to a TDIU, on an extraschedular basis, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

Beginning March 9, 2011, the Veteran has been unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to TDIU, beginning March 9, 2011, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1988 to August 1992, during Peacetime and the Gulf War Era.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which in pertinent part, granted entitlement to a TDIU effective July 31, 2018.

In the February 2024 Board Appeal: Notice of Disagreement, VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As such, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal (August 4, 2023). The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the decision on appeal (on or after August 5, 2023). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claims. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Because the issue of extraschedular consideration for a TDIU for the period prior to March 9, 2011 is being remanded, any evidence that is not considered by the Board at this time for that claim will be considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) upon readjudication of the claim.

The Veteran contends that a TDIU is warranted for the period prior to the effective date of July 31, 2018.

?

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

The Veteran has continuously pursued the claim for an initial rating for gastritis since January 7, 2010, the initial grant of service connection for gastritis. Thus, the appeal period begins on that date. The appeal period ends on July 30, 2018, as the Veteran has already been granted a TDIU from July 31, 2018.

During the appeal period, the Veteran was service connected for bilateral pes planus at 30 percent from June 30, 2009; post cholecystectomy syndrome with gastritis at 30 percent from March 9, 2011; right knee disability at 10 percent from June 30, 2009; left knee disability at 10 percent from June 30, 2009; left ankle disability at 10 percent from June 30, 2009; tinnitus at 10 percent from June 30, 2009; gastritis at 10 percent from January 7, 2010 to March 9, 2011; PFB as noncompensable from June 30, 2009; and surgical scars as noncompensable from March 9, 2011. The Veteran's combined disability rating was 70 percent from March 9, 2011, and 60 percent prior to that. F

rom March 9, 2011 to July 31, 2018, when considering disabilities of both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, the Veteran has had at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability ratings to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more; thus, the Board may consider the claim for a TDIU on a schedular basis from March 9, 2011. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a)(1). 

However, prior to March 9, 2011, the Veteran does not have sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more; thus, for the period prior to March 9, 2011, the Board may only consider a TDIU on an extraschedular basis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). 

As such, these periods will be discussed separately.

In determining unemployability for VA purposes, consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to age or any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Hersey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 91, 94 (1992); Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000).  The sole fact that a Veteran is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough, as a high rating in itself is a recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment.  The question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993) (citing 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.15, 4.16(a)).  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (noting that, while "the rating schedule is based on the 'average impairment in earning capacity caused by a disability,'... entitlement to TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstance").

In Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019), the Court defined the term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" to include two components: one economic and one non-economic. The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce poverty threshold for one person. The non-economic component includes consideration of the veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). 

In short, an award of a TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. See Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Rather, the ultimate question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether the Veteran can find employment. See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

Accordingly, the question the Board can address in the first instance becomes whether the evidence supports entitlement to a TDIU from March 9, 2011 to July 31, 2018 on a schedular basis. As an initial matter, the record consistently indicates that the Veteran stopped working well before the period on appeal (on January 10, 2010). Thus, the Board must consider whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded gainful employment from March 9, 2011 to July 31, 2018.

As for work history and education, in the Veteran's February 2015 Application for a TDIU, the Veteran noted that he worked as a security consultant from May 2004 to January 2010. He stated he last worked on January 10, 2010. The Veteran also reported he had two years of college and received bodyguard training from October 2004 to December 2004.

The other evidence of record shows, in a September 2009 statement from the Veteran's employer, the employer stated that the Veteran had many instances where he could not report for work due to some type of on-going physical issue. It was noted that the employer, ACG, had made efforts to accommodate the Veteran for a number of years, and the Veteran continued to perform his job but at times it was just too much for him and he missed his shift.

In a November 2011 VA Gastritis Examination, the VA examiner found there was no functional impact of the Veteran's condition.

In a March 2012 VA Ankle Examination, the VA examiner found there was no functional impact of the Veteran's condition.

In a March 2012 VA Skin Examination, the VA examiner noted there was no functional impact of the Veteran's PFB.

In a June 2012 VA Foot Examination, the VA examiner found the Veteran's pes planus did impact his ability to work in that he used to work as a security guard and had problems with check points due to his condition.

In correspondence received from the Veteran in October 2012, the Veteran stated that a few years prior, the pain in his feet became unbearable and it interfered with his job as an unarmed guard in that he could not inspect and man his post on foot, which caused him to lose his job in January 2010.

In July 2013, the Veteran underwent a VA Stomach Examination, the VA examiner found that there was no functional impact of the Veteran's gastritis.

In a September 2013 statement, the Veteran reported that his stomach condition made it impossible to control his bowel functions; his foot and knee pain made it hard to move around; he lost his last job because he was unable to control his bowels, and his condition was so severe it impacted daily life.

In September 2014, a buddy statement from D.C. was received stating she had witnessed the Veteran barely able to walk because of problems with his feet, and there had been times when the Veteran could not leave the house because of gastrointestinal problems (pain and extreme diarrhea).

In September 2014, a buddy statement from the Veteran's mother, C.E., was received stating the Veteran maintained employment until November, 2009 when his gall bladder was removed at the V.A. hospital, and this made it impossible for him to control his bodily functions during random bouts of diarrhea.

In September 2014, a buddy statement from T.W. was received stating he had taken the Veteran to the VA medical center for various complaints of depression, stomach pains, irritable bowel, foot pain.

In an October 2014 VA IBS Examination, the VA examiner found that the functional impact of this condition was that the Veteran used to work as the head of security and he lost his job due to having to call in too many times due to the episodes of IBS.

In February 2015, the Veteran submitted correspondence stating that he lost his job because he could not control his bowels.

In a May 2015 VA Audiological Examination, it was noted the functional impact of the Veteran's tinnitus was that different sounds trigger it, it stayed with him, and it came with headaches.

In August 2015, it was reported that the Veteran submitted information to the RO that he was homeless.

In a December 2015 VA Skin Examination, the VA examiner noted there was no functional impact of the Veteran's PFB.

In August 2017, the Veteran submitted written correspondence in which the Veteran stated that on December 23, 2009 it was busy at work and he soiled himself trying to get to the restroom. He stated people came into the restroom and teased him and made jokes about the incident. Then, it happened again in January 2010 and he was told he was permanently relieved of duty.

In July 2023, the Veteran was denied Social Security Administration (SSA) benefits because he had not been under a disability within the meaning of the Social Security Act from January 10, 2010 through the date of decision. To this, the Board notes that SSA determinations are not dispositive in terms of a grant of entitlement to a TDIU. See Collier v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 413, 417 (1991) (VA is not bound by SSA decision because the agencies have different disability requirements). 

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, specifically including his pes planus, lower extremity disabilities, gastrointestinal disabilities, and tinnitus, preclude him from being able to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and work history from March 9, 2011. First, the Veteran repeatedly stated that his intestinal issues prevent him from working in a normal manner, and this was one reason he lost his previous employment. 

Second, the Veteran's former employer submitted correspondence that the Veteran was given numerous accommodations and missed shifts due to physical ailments. On this topic, the Board notes the Veteran's physical ailments that the Veteran complained of at that time correspond to the current service-connected disabilities of gastritis and pes planus. 

Third, there are several VA examiners who stated the Veteran's ability to work was impacted by his service-connected conditions: In the June 2012 VA Foot Examination, the VA examiner found the Veteran's pes planus impacted his ability to work in that he used to work as a security guard and had problems with check points due to his condition. In the October 2014 VA IBS Examination, the VA examiner found that the functional impact of this condition was that the Veteran used to work as the head of security and he lost his job due to having to call in too many times due to the episodes of IBS. In a May 2015 VA Audiological Examination, it was noted the functional impact of the Veteran's tinnitus was that different sounds trigger it, it stayed with him, and it came with headaches. 

Additionally, the Board finds the buddy statement from D.C., that she had witnessed the Veteran barely able to walk because of problems with his feet, and witnessed times when the Veteran could not leave the house because of gastrointestinal problems (pain and extreme diarrhea), competent, credible, and probative. The Board finds the buddy statement from the Veteran's mother, that in 2009 it became impossible for the Veteran to control his bodily functions during random bouts of diarrhea, competent, credible, and probative. The Board also finds the buddy statement from T.W., that he had taken the Veteran to the VA medical center for various complaints of stomach pains, irritable bowel, and foot pain, competent, credible, and probative.

Overall, the Board notes the Veteran performed a physical job, namely security guard, and the evidence shows he was unable to continue working that job because his feet and lower extremity issues prevented him from being able to go to the security check points and move around. As such, his service-connected disabilities prevent him from working in a field in which he has prior work experience and training. Moreover, the evidence shows the Veteran's intestinal issues disrupted his work or prevented him from coming into work often enough that it was deemed a problem for employment and daily life, as evidenced by the employer's statement, the Veteran's statements, the buddy statements, and the VA examiner's statements. The Board also notes that even sedentary employment would be interrupted by frequent trips to the bathroom or frequent absences from work due to this problem. Lastly, the Board notes that tinnitus poses a problem in that communication issues and headaches would make working more difficult for the Veteran in both manual and sedentary work. 

As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities preclude him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment, and therefore, a TDIU is warranted from March 9, 2011. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. In reaching the above conclusions, the Board has appropriately applied the benefit of the doubt in this case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

REASONS FOR REMAND

As noted above, for the period prior to March 9, 2011, the Veteran does not meet the schedular criteria for a TDIU; however, the Veteran may still be entitled to a TDIU through extraschedular consideration. See Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

Based on the above evidence in the applicable appeal period, the evidence demonstrates that prior to March 9, 2011, there is a reasonable possibility that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, specifically including his pes planus, lower extremity disabilities, and gastritis disabilities, preclude him from being able to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment consistent with his education and work history. Accordingly, a remand is required for referral of the claim for a TDIU for the period prior to March 9, 2011 to the Director, Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration. See Snider, supra.
