FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1969 to June 1973.

On May 31, 2005, the Veteran filed a disability claim for entitlement to service connection for left and right leg and left and right arm with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  On May 10, 2006, the VA Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision denying service connection for the claimed disabilities.

On September 22, 2008, the Veteran filed a supplemental disability claim for entitlement to service connection for left and right leg and left and right arm with the VA.  On February 24, 2009, the RO issued a rating decision confirming and continuing the denial of service connection for the claimed disabilities.

On September 9, 2020, the Veteran filed a supplemental disability claim for entitlement to service connection for vascular neuropathy secondary to his service-connected heart issue.  On November 24, 2020, the RO issued a rating decision finding no new and relevant evidence was received and denied service connection for left and right arm.

On March 3, 2021, the Veteran filed a new supplemental disability claim for entitlement to service connection for vascular neuropathy.  On July 7, 2021, the RO found new and relevant evidence but denied the claim for service connection for left and right arm.

On September 9, 2021, the RO did a special review of the claims file mandated by federal court order in Nehmer v. Department of Veterans Affairs.  Nehmer v. United States Veterans Administration, 712 F. Supp. 1404 (N.D. Cal. 1989 ); Nehmer v. United States Veterans Administration, 32 F. Supp. 2d. 1175 (N.D. Cal. 1999); Nehmer v. Veterans Administration of the Government of the United States, 284 F.3d. 1158 (9th Cir. 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.816.  The RO then issued a rating decision confirming and continuing the denial of service connection for left and right leg and left and right arm.

On October 26, 2021, the Veteran appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request.  In the October 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected Hearing Docket.  A Board hearing was held on November 1, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2021 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of left and right leg and left and right arm, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the readjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the modernized review system, the Board must remand appeals to the RO to correct pre-decision duty-to-assist errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Here, the record reveals duty-to-assist errors that occurred prior to the September 2021 rating decision; therefore, a remand is required to correct the errors.  Id.  

Legal Criteria

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Service connection can be established on a presumptive, direct, or secondary basis.  This case concerns the second and third theories of relief.

The three-element test for direct service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

To establish entitlement to service connection on a secondary basis, there must be (1) a current disability; (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) a nexus between the service-connected disability and the current disability. Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998), superseded by statute, 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a).    

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d. 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  

Entitlement to Service Connection- Left Leg and Right Leg

The Veteran contends he has weakness in his legs due to his service in Vietnam.  See September 2005, VA Form 21-4138.  

Service treatment records were reviewed.  The Veteran had no complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for his left or right leg during service.

The Veteran's private treatment records were reviewed.  In December 2002, the Veteran had complaints regarding left leg pain, numbness, and tingling.  See December 2022, Medical Treatment Record.

The Veteran's VA treatment records were reviewed.  On December 28, 2006, the Veteran reported stabbing pain down his legs.  See July 2021, CAPRI.  On December 12, 2007, the Veteran reported back pain that radiates to his legs which causes excruciating pain.  Id.  On October 24, 2013, the Veteran reported he has a history of subclavian steal in his arms that also involved his thighs and legs.  Id.  On September 2014, the Veteran reported tingling and numbness in his right leg and that his left leg was worse.  See May 2015, CAPRI.  On October 22, 2014, the Veteran was seen for treatment and evaluation of his leg pain.  See July 2021, CAPRI.  On November 5, 2014, the Veteran reported bilateral calf pain that is sharp and stabbing.  See July 2021, CAPRI.  

The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination.

The governing law and regulations provide that a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam war (i.e., January 9, 1962, to May 7, 1975), shall be presumed to have been exposed to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  For these Vietnam veterans, diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents will be presumed to have been incurred in service even though there is no evidence of that disease during the period of service at issue.  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  While early-onset peripheral neuropathy  is a presumptive condition, peripheral neuropathy is not a presumptive condition.  

In cases where service connection on a presumptive basis is not warranted, a claimant is not precluded from establishing service connection with proof of direct causation.  Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  

The Veteran served in Vietnam (boots on the ground) and his exposure to herbicides has been conceded.  See May 2021, VA Memo.   

In McLendon?v. Nicholson,?20?Vet. App.?79?(2006), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) set forth the criteria considered when determining whether a VA examination is necessary to assist in establishing service connection on a direct basis.  

 

The Court held that a VA examination is warranted when there is:  

(1) competent evidence of a current disorder or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disorder; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies; and (3) an indication that the disorder, or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disorder, may be associated with the Veteran's active military service, but that (4) insufficient competent medical evidence is on file for the VA Secretary to make a decision on the claim.? 

Id. at 81. 

The Court further explained that: 

The types of evidence that indicate that a current disability may be associated with military service include, but are not limited to, medical evidence that suggests a nexus but is too equivocal or lacking in specificity to support a decision on the merits, or credible evidence of continuity of symptomatology such as pain or other symptoms capable of lay observation. 

Id. at 83 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The threshold for finding a link between current disability and service is low.  Id.; Locklear v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?410 (2006). 

The law establishing the modernized review system abrogated the Secretary's duty to assist for cases on appeal to the Board. 38?U.S.C. §?5103A(e)(2).  But the duty to assist remains in full force when a claim is before the RO for adjudication. Id. § 5103A(e)(1). And if the Board identifies a duty-to-assist error that occurred prior to the issuance of the decision on appeal, it must remand the matter to the RO to cure the error. Id. § 5103A(f)(2)(A). 

So, the question for the Board is whether deciding the claim without obtaining a medical examination, of the Veteran constitutes a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error, for which the Board must remand the claim to cure.  Accordingly, the locus of the inquiry is on what was before the RO at the time of the decision on appeal and if that evidence met the low threshold to indicate an association triggering the duty to assist. 

Applying this legal framework to the facts of the instant matters pertaining to the claimed right and left leg, the Board finds that, at the time the RO issued the rating decision on appeal, there was competent evidence of the Veteran having symptoms of leg pain, tingling and numbness in his legs, and subclavian steal; evidence establishing an in-service event (the Veteran has Vietnam service); there is an indication that the Veteran's disabilities may be associated with his service (the Veteran's duties in Vietnam were consistent with exposure to herbicides); and there is insufficient competent evidence to make a decision on the claim.

Based only on the evidence of the record at the time the RO issued the rating decision on appeal, and under the?low bar?of?McLendon, the Board finds each of the four elements have been met and concludes that the Veteran should have been afforded VA medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the claimed right and left leg prior to a decision being made on his claim.  

The Board concludes that error must be cured, on remand, by scheduling the Veteran for examinations, as outlined below. 

Entitlement to Service Connection-Left Arm

The Veteran seeks service connection for his left arm as secondary to his service-connected disability of coronary artery disease (CAD).  The Veteran has referred to this condition as peripheral neuropathy and vascular neuropathy.  See September 2020, VA Form 20-0995 and March 2021, VA Form 20-0995.  The Veteran has been service-connected for CAD since August 2003.  See September 2021, Code Sheet.

Service treatment records were reviewed.  The Veteran had no complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for his left arm during service.

Private treatment records were reviewed.  On January 7, 2003, the Veteran attended a Vascular appointment and reported weakness in his left arm and light-headedness.  See October 2005, Medical Treatment Record.  On January 23, 2003, the Veteran reported some numbness of his left arm intermittently, and his physician notated "I do not have an answer for that."  See July 2005, Medical Treatment Record.  On October 6, 2008, the Veteran was seen for an electrodiagnostic evaluation.  See September 2021, Medical Treatment Record.  The Veteran reported bilateral hand numbness and aching. Id.  At that examination the examiner found the Veteran had a normal electrodiagnostics study.  Id.    

The Veteran's VA treatment records were reviewed.  On April 9, 2003, the Veteran attended a Cardiology consultation where he reported left arm and hand numbness not associated with chest pain.  The examiner provided an impression of left shoulder and arm pain with numbness and weakness.  See March 1, 2017, CAPRI.  On December 17, 2012, the Veteran's VA treatment notes reflect he has subclavian stenosis documented in a doppler study of upper extremity in 2008 with right sided stenosis of more than 60 percent.  See May 2021, CAPRI.   On October 24, 2013, the Veteran saw a VA examiner and reported numbness and profound coldness in his extremities.  The examiner provided an assessment of paresthesias with unclear etiology.  See March 2017, CAPRI.  

On November 13, 2020, the Veteran attended a VA examination for peripheral nerve conditions.  See November 2020, C&P Exam.  At that examination the examiner found the Veteran did not have a diagnosis for his left arm.  However, the examiner found decreased strength, in the Veteran's left pinch (thumb to index finger) and grip strength, at a 4/5 (active movement against some resistance). The Veteran reported weakness in grip strength and cold sensation in his hands.  All other testing was normal, and the examiner found no functional impairment.  The examiner provided the following opinion: "There is no diagnosed peripheral neuropathy of right upper or left upper extremity.  The paresthesias/ cold sensations of upper extremities are most likely due to Raynaud's syndrome.  EMG of upper extremities are normal (CPRS 2010), when symptoms began."  Id. 

On February 16, 2021, the Veteran attended a VA examination for peripheral nerve conditions.  At that examination the examiner found the Veteran did not have a diagnosis for his left arm.  However, the examiner found the Veteran had moderate paresthesias and numbness in his left upper extremity attributable to a peripheral nerve condition.  The Veteran reported numbness and tingling in hands and all fingers with poor grip in both hands.  All other testing was normal, and the examiner found no functional impairment.  

The Board finds both the November 2020 and February 2021 VA examinations inadequate for adjudicative purposes.  Specifically, the Board finds both examiners failed to reconcile the documented symptoms on examination in contrast to their findings of no diagnosis.  Neither examiner accounted for the pathology of the symptoms identified in their examinations.  

The November 2020 VA examiner did not adequately support the finding of decreased left pinch and grip strength while finding the Veteran had no diagnosis.  While the examiner attributed the Veteran's paresthesias/cold sensations of his upper extremity to a possible Raynaud's diagnosis, this did not account for the findings of decreased grip strength.  

The February 2021 VA examiner did not adequately support the finding of moderate paresthesias and numbness in his left upper extremity attributable to a peripheral nerve condition, while finding the Veteran had no diagnosis.  

Finally, both VA examiners failed to adequately address the Veteran's subjective symptoms and lay statements.  Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 258-60 (2020) (unless the Board finds the lay statements not competent or not credible, an examiner's opinion must address the Veteran's relevant lay statements in order to include enough detail to inform the Board's decision.  Failure to do so renders that opinion inadequate).  

The Board finds remand is necessary to correct the above pre-decisional duty-to-assist error and fulfill the RO's duty to assist.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

Entitlement to Service Connection-Right Arm

The Veteran seeks service connection for his right arm as secondary to his service-connected disability of CAD.  The Veteran has referred to this condition as peripheral neuropathy and vascular neuropathy.  See September 2020, VA Form 20-0995 and March 2021, VA Form 20-0995.  The Veteran has been service-connected for CAD since August 2003.  See September 2021, Code Sheet.

Because the legal landscape has shifted appreciably on the question of secondary service connection, the Board believes the following explication will be of some small service to the cause of justice and judicial economy and efficiency-the avoidance of remands.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) had recent occasion to consider matters relevant to the instant case and their holding illuminates the Board's way (and the RO's on remand). 

In Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023), the Federal Circuit held that under the causation standard of section 1110 of Title 38 of the United States Code, secondary service connection is warranted where a nonservice-connected disability would have been less severe "but-for"  a service connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.  Id. at 1365.

In the same case, the Federal Circuit expressly held that section 3.310(b) of Title 38 of Code of Federal Regulations, the regulation that would otherwise control the outcome here, is unlawful because it is inconsistent with section 1110 of Title 38 of the United States Code.  Id. at 1366.

After careful review, the Board concludes that the opinion in the record does not address the correct legal standards and the holding in Spicer.  61 F.4th at 1364-66.  

The February 2021, the Veteran attended a VA examination.  At that examination the Veteran was diagnosed with right carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).  The VA examiner opined it was less likely than not the Veteran's right arm was proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected CAD.  Specifically, the examiner found the Veteran's "peripheral neuropathy is caused CTS which does not have a causal relationship with CAD."  See February 2021, C&P Exam.  

In reaching their opinion, the examiner used the proximate cause standard from the then-controlling regulation now struck down by the Spicer court.  Accordingly, the Board finds this opinion inadequate because it is premised upon a standard which has departed the firmament; that is to say, it is no longer good law.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  ("Once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service-connection claim . . . VA must provide an adequate one").  

Therefore, the Board finds that a remand is warranted to obtain a direct and secondary service connection opinion, as outlined below, in accordance with the holding in Spicer.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination for the examiner to consider the Veteran's current manifestations and complications of his left and right leg. 

Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's left and right leg.  The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand decision, must be made available to, and reviewed by, the clinician.  The reviewing clinician must opine on:

Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's left and right leg was incurred in service and is related to an in-service injury, event, or illness.

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate examiner to consider all the Veteran's VA treatment records, private medical records, manifestation of symptoms, and lay statements for his left upper extremity.

Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's condition, if diagnosed.  The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand decision, must be made available to, and reviewed by, the clinician.  The reviewing clinician must opine on:

Whether it is approximately at least as likely as not that the service-connected CAD, was a "but-for cause" of (caused an increase in the severity of, or an inability to treat) the Veteran's left arm condition?  Spicer, 61 F.4th at 1364-66.

3. Schedule the Veteran for a medical examination and obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's right arm CTS.  The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand decision, must be made available to, and reviewed by, the clinician.  The reviewing clinician must opine on:

Whether it is approximately at least as likely as not that the service-connected CAD was a "but-for cause" of (caused an increase in the severity of, or an inability to treat) the Veteran's right arm CTS?  Spicer, 61 F.4th at 1364-66.

4. A complete rationale, including citation to appropriate medical principles, for each opinion reached must be provided. 

The examiner is respectfully reminded that the absence of in-service evidence of disability is not fatal to a service connection claim. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
