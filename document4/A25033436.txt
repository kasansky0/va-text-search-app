ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for respiratory issues is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 27, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran's representation that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for the issue of service connection for respiratory issues have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from February 2005 to November 2012.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. In the present case, the Veteran's authorized representative has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
