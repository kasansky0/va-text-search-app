REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for asthma is remanded.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2011 to August 2012.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

The RO denied the Veteran's claim for an increased disability rating in a September 2022 rating decision.  In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Higher-Level Review decision review request.  As documented in a June 2023 rating decision, the RO found a pre-decisional error in VA's duty to assist the Veteran prior to the issuance of the September 2022 rating decision.  After conducting additional development, the RO conducted a Supplemental Claim Review in the January 2024 rating decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding this claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for asthma.

The Board finds that remand is required for an adequate VA examination in order to rate the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(2)(5) provides that when evaluating based on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), the examiner must use post-bronchodilator results in applying the evaluation criteria in the rating schedule unless the post-bronchodilator results were poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results; in those cases, the pre-bronchodilator values are used for rating purposes.  Here, VA examinations conducted in July 2022 and January 2024 do not document post-bronchodilator testing, and they are inadequate for rating purposes.  

Further, in the July 2022 VA examination, the examiner indicated that the Veteran did not engage in bronchodilator therapy.  The January 2024 VA examiner noted that the Veteran used bronchodilator therapy intermittently.  However, VA treatment records document the Veteran receiving a prescription for an albuterol inhaler with the direction to use the inhaler two times per day.  

In a March 2023 argument, the Veteran's representative explained that the Veteran took Albuterol through an oral inhaler two times per day.  VA treatment records show that the Veteran had an active prescription for an albuterol inhaler from January 2023 to January 2024 with the directive to inhale two puffs by mouth four times per day as needed for lungs.  Though the prescription reads "as needed," it does suggest that regular daily use is recommended.  Daily use of an oral bronchodilator potentially falls within the criteria for a 30 percent disability rating for the Veteran's asthma.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6602.  It is unclear whether the Veteran does perform daily bronchodilator therapy, but the record raises the question, and it remains unresolved after the January 2024 VA examination.  

For these reasons, the Board finds that the VA examinations of record are inadequate for rating purposes, and the AOJ's reliance on these examinations constituted a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  A new examination should be provided on remand to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist omission.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Provide the Veteran with an appropriate examination to determine the severity of his service-connected asthma.  The entire claims file must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner.  Any indicated tests and studies must be accomplished, and all clinical findings must be reported in detail and correlated to a specific diagnosis.  An explanation for all opinions expressed must be provided.  The relevant Disability Benefits Questionnaire must be utilized.

It is requested that the examination provide post-bronchodilator PFT testing.
