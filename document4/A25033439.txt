ORDER

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided to the Veteran from October 18, 2020, through October 21, 2020, is dismissed.  

FINDING OF FACT

After a secondary review, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) approved and paid reimbursement for the non-VA medical services provided to the Veteran from October 18, 2020, through October 21, 2020.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment or reimbursement of the cost of non-VA medical services provided to the Veteran from October 18, 2020, through October 21, 2020, has been resolved in full; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. § 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104, 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a non-VA provider who provided medical services to the Veteran.

The decision on appeal was issued in February 2021 by the VHA and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the April 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Hearing docket.  On March 28, 2025, the appellant withdrew the hearing request.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). I f evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement of the cost of non-VA medical services provided to the Veteran from October 18, 2020, through October 21, 2020, is dismissed.  

The appellant seeks reimbursement for medical services provided to the Veteran from October 18, 2020, through October 21, 2020, which was denied in a February 2021 decision because it was not timely under 38 U.S.C. § 1725.  

During the pendency of the appeal, the claim was administratively overturned and paid.  A July 2021 decision reflects that the episode of care was approved under 38 U.S.C. § 1725.  VHA records reflect that $4,023.87 was paid to the appellant through electronic funds transfer on July 13, 2021.  A January 2022 letter informed the appellant that upon secondary review, the appeal for timely filing for the episode of care from October 18, 2020, through October 21, 2020, was approved.  

As the claim for reimbursement was granted under 38 U.S.C. § 1725, there is no longer a question for appellate consideration by the Board.  Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(a), 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.
