ORDER

Entitlement to a 30 percent rating, but no higher, for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is granted for the entire appeal period.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's GERD demonstrates symptoms consistent with persistent recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health, but did not demonstrate symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for GERD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5017; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 4.1-4.7, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1984 to October 1984.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a August 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The AMA creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400 (a)(1). The rating decision in this case was issued after February 19, 2019; thus, the AMA framework applies.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD

The Veteran has a current disability rating of 10 percent for his service-connected GERD, effective August 29, 2022.

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

A Veteran is competent to report as to the observable events and symptoms he experiences and their history. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

In evaluating the evidence in an appeal, it is the responsibility of the Board to weigh the evidence and decide where to give credit and where to withhold same and, in doing so, accept certain medical opinions over others. Schoolman v. West, 12 Vet. App. 307 (1999). In this regard, the Board has been charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to the evidence. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (2007). Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021).

The Veteran's GERD has been evaluated under Diagnostic Code 7399-7346. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the specific basis for the evaluation assigned. The additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Unlisted disabilities requiring rating by analogy will be coded by the numbers of the most closely related body part and "99". Id. 

Under diagnostic code 7346 for hiatal hernia (to which the Veteran's disability is rated by analogy), a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for two or more symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. The maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114.

The rating code applicable to GERD does not define the terms "considerable," "severe," or "persistently." However, the term "considerable" is defined by the dictionary as "large in extent or degree," and "severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267, 1140 (11th ed. 2012). The term "persistently" is defined as "existing for a long or longer than usual time or continuously." Id. 

During the pendency of the appeal, VA published amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, the Schedule of Ratings for the Digestive System, effective May 19, 2024. Prior to this date, GERD was rated analogous to hiatal hernia under Diagnostic Code 7346. Under the amended criteria, a new diagnostic code (Diagnostic Code 7206) was added for GERD.

Under the new Diagnostic Code 7206 for GERD, a 30 percent rating is assigned for documented history of esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than two times per year. A 50 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement. A maximum 80 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube).

If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); see also Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; Kuzma, 341 F. 3d 1327. Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to May 19, 2024, and both the old and new rating criteria from May 19, 2024. 

In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted a statement in August 2020.  In that statement, the Veteran related that he has multiple symptoms of GERD, including nausea, heartburn, back pain, regurgitation, acid reflux, difficulty swallowing, a feeling of food coming back into the throat, vomiting, and coughing weekly.  He also reported chest pain and shoulder pain associated with flare-ups of GERD.  He indicated he takes over-the-counter medications to help control his severe heartburn and has been prescribed Prilosec.  He reported he must avoid certain foods, especially spicy or acidic foods, due to worsening of symptoms.  He stated he cannot eat late in the day or at night or lie down after eating due to worsening regurgitation.  He requires multiple pillows to prop up his head while sleeping, but still is unable to sleep more than three hours straight due to awakening from symptoms.  His trouble sleeping has caused difficulty with concentration and thinking, and daytime fatigue.  The Board finds the Veteran is competent and credible to report his ongoing symptoms associated with GERD and therefore finds his statement probative. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In October 2011, the Veteran was diagnosed with GERD and his medication list indicated omeprazole.   In August 2020, VA examiner J. T., diagnosed GERD and noted symptoms of pyrosis, reflux, and regurgitation.  The VA examiner noted the functional impact of frequent bathroom breaks due to GERD symptoms.  In December 2022, VA examiner F. F., found the Veteran has symptoms of persistent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, and sleep disturbance.  The VA examiner noted his sleep disturbance leads to fatigue, causing difficulty with focus and concentration during the day.  The Veteran reported nausea symptoms occurring 4 or more times per year, lasting 1 to 9 days in duration, and vomiting episodes occurring 4 or more times per year, lasting 1 to 9 days in duration.  The examiner noted no esophageal stricture, spasm, or diverticula, and no symptoms of considerable impairment of health, hematemesis, or melena with moderate anemia.  The Board finds this opinion of some probative weight as it takes into account only some of the Veteran's reported symptoms and fails to explain why the remainder were not taken into consideration, in particular the Veteran's reported chest and shoulder pain during flares of GERD.

After review of the evidence in the matter, the Board finds the application of the old Diagnostic Code 7346 is more beneficial to the Veteran.  The new criteria under Diagnostic Code 7206 require a showing of documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia requiring various treatment or causing various symptoms as delineated in the ratings greater than 30 percent under Diagnostic Code 7206 stated above.  As found by VA examiners in August 2020 and December 2022, the Veteran does not have an esophageal stricture, spasm of the esophagus, or acquired diverticulum of the esophagus, nor do the medical treatment records indicate an history of esophageal stricture(s).  Therefore, the more beneficial diagnosis code is the old version, Diagnostic Code 7346.

The Board finds that a 30 percent evaluation for the Veteran's GERD is warranted under Diagnostic Code 7346.  The Board acknowledges that there is no medical opinion indicating the Veteran has considerable impairment of health.  However, in resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, and based upon his competent and credible lay statements, as well as the worsening of symptoms between the two VA examinations and medical evidence of persistent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, and sleep disturbance, the Board is awarding 30 percent for the entire period on appeal under Diagnostic Code 7346.

Although the Veteran's symptoms have demonstrated an increase in severity between the VA examinations, the Board also finds that they do not meet the criteria for a 60 percent evaluation. There is no evidence of material weight loss, hematemesis, or melena with moderate anemia. The combined symptoms are not documented as having produced severe impairment of health. As such, the Veteran's GERD disability does not meet the criteria for a rating in excess of 30 percent for the period on appeal.

Accordingly, the Veteran's symptoms of GERD are appropriately contemplated by the 30 percent rating. Thus, a 30 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the entire period on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.
