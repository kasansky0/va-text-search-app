ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss is related to in-service acoustic trauma.

2. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's current tinnitus is related to in-service acoustic trauma.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1975 to July 1975.

This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 higher-level-review (HLR) decision, following a November 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the time to modify his NOD under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2) has not yet expired. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024) ("because [38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2)] gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up").  However, as the Board is granting the benefits sought in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in issuing the decision now.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in the active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b), where a chronic disease is shown as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease are generally service connected; if a chronic disease is noted in service but chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity of symptomatology after separation is required. Entitlement to service connection based on chronicity or continuity of symptomatology pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) applies only when the disability for which the Veteran is claiming compensation is due to a disease enumerated on the list of chronic diseases in 38 U.S.C. § 1101 (3) or 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus are organic diseases of the nervous system and therefore chronic diseases. Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 264 (2015).

In addition, 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 provides that impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability only if at least one of the thresholds for the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; the thresholds for at least three of the frequencies are greater than 25 decibels; or speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.

Bilateral Hearing Loss / Tinnitus  

The RO favorably found that the Veteran has current diagnoses of bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. The hearing loss diagnosis is consistent with the audiometric and speech recognition scores on the August 2019 VA audiologic examination, which showed impaired hearing pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The RO further found that the Veteran had a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's service. Specifically, the Veteran's military occupational specialty of wheeled vehicle mechanic reflects noise exposure. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. Therefore, the Board will address whether the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus are related to the conceded in-service noise exposure.

In February 2019, June 2019, and August 2023 statement in support of claim (VA Form 21-4138), the Veteran reports hearing loss and tinnitus due to noise exposure, and hearing protection was neither provided nor required. He noted his hearing issues started during basic training and advanced individual training, and his hearing and the ringing in his ears have gotten worse over the years.  

With regard to a nexus, the Veteran underwent a VA audiological examination in July 2019. The examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is less likely as not caused by or a result of an event in military service. The examiner explained the Veteran was in active duty only four months and reported he was not around loud noise after that. He also reports he had no difficulty hearing until approximately a year ago when his hearing in his right ear decreased. Since there is no evidence of hearing loss until the last year as reported by Veteran, it is less likely than not caused by a result of an event in military service. 

A September 2019 VA audiological examination report shows the examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is less likely as not caused by or a result of an event in military service. The examiner explained that the Veteran served in the military four months and indicates loss was noticed one to two years ago. The examiner noted this would be many years after separation from the military, and medical literature does not support delayed onset of hearing loss.

The examiner also opined that the Veteran's tinnitus is less likely than not caused by or a result of an event in military service. The examiner explained the onset of tinnitus is reported by the Veteran to be post-separation or one to two years ago. There is no report of tinnitus in service treatment records, at separation or in the medical records until the time of the claim. The examiner noted the current literature does not support late onset noise-induced tinnitus.

The Veteran underwent a VA audiological examination in August 2024. The examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is less likely as not caused by or a result of an event in military service. The examiner explained the STRs, and separation exam are silent for hearing loss. The Veteran reports onset of hearing decrease as 2017, years' post-separation after exposure to recreational and/or occupational noise. The examiner noted that although noise exposure is conceded and the relationship between noise, auditory damage and hearing loss is well documented, auditory damage and hearing loss are not conceded based on noise alone. 

The examiner also opined that the Veteran's tinnitus is less likely than not caused by or a result of an event in military service. The examiner explained the onset of tinnitus is reported by the Veteran to be post-separation or one to two years ago. There is no report of tinnitus in service treatment records, at separation or in the medical records until the time of the claim. The examiner noted the current literature does not support late onset noise-induced tinnitus.

In this case, although the VA examiners rendered opinions that the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus disabilities were not related to in-service noise exposure, such opinions are of no probative value, as they were based on the absence of in-service evidence of a bilateral hearing loss disability. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993); Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992) (the absence of hearing loss disability in service is not in and of itself fatal to a claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d) (service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service).  In addition, the opinions do not consider the Veteran's competent and credible statements of hearing loss and tinnitus symptoms in and since military service, apparently misunderstanding his responses during the examinations. In this regard, a medical opinion is inadequate if it is based solely on the absence of documentation in the record and does not take into account the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history (even if recorded in the course of the examination). Dalton v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007).

There is no other probative evidence of record which attributes the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus to any other cause than in-service noise exposure. The Veteran indicated in his lay statements that he experienced hearing loss and tinnitus in and since service. The Board finds the Veteran's statements in this regard to be competent and credible. Moreover, VA laws and regulations require an adjudicator to review the entire record, including lay statements, and give due consideration to VA policy to administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with the facts in each individual case. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). After so doing, and with reasonable doubt resolved in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements regarding the in-service noise exposure, hearing loss and tinnitus in and since service, and the clinical evidence showing a current diagnoses of bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, provide a sufficient basis to grant service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
